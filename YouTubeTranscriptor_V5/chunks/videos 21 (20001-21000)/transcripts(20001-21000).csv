5 Popular Exercises - MADE BETTER!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59WTOLAmE3k	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com today we about five incredibly popular exercises that I better by the end of this video and we popular we Bulgarian split squats pull-ups and yes even a tricep pushdown now let with the dip because I want to make an impact right off the bat you know what a dip looks like you them if not hundreds of thousands of them depending upon how long you spent in the gym the fact is we can make this exercise better when I say better it not gimmicky it better we know that we can work our chest in the dip but we can also do at the end of every single rep that not only will not take away from what you doing with your chest but will add to the effectiveness of the exercise is a dip plus so the dip plus you see what I do at the top of the rep and they don just hang out there or get ready to descend into my next rep but I established a longer contraction on the chest by holding at the top and then I lift up and tuck my pelvis up underneath me which instantly activates the ABS and serratus and we know that the serratus is going to tie in to the overall appearance of the chest as well so it a perfect complement to what you trying to do and all I little extra lift at the end of every single rep again not going to take away from the effectiveness of the exercise itself next up I mentioned the tricep pushdown and again we to make this exercise better I actually devoted an entire video to this before but it needs to be shown again because it use a cable for a tricep pushdown that the line of force is going to be in line with the direction of the cable and if we the triceps do that cable should stay perpendicular to your forearm for as long as you can in the exercise in the beginning of the exercise it is perpendicular to the the forearm but when you finish it actually winds up being a lot steeper and more parallel to the forearm so that worked with the triceps are doing in the peak contracted position on a regular push down it just not there but what we can do is Institute this rocking tricep pushdown and what this does is it maintains that perpendicularity of the line the the actual cable itself to your forearm throughout the entire range so you can see when I start the movement here it starts perpendicular to the forearm and as I rock back it allows the angle to stay as perpendicular as it get and you from doing this that your ability to hold the contraction of the tricep is challenged even more meaning you going to get more from doing this variation of the exercise remember it not compromising the integrity of the movement to make it unique it to the effectiveness of the movement that makes it more worthwhile next we this is one of my favorite movements you can do anyway it squat I like it because it leg movement it one limitation here it does require an additional balanced component that a lot of us may not have and if you to use this exercise to train for strength because you can because you basically loading pretty much 80% on that one front leg well we want to take the balance component out of it then in that case because we want to focus only on the strength overload and we could do that with the hand supported Bulgarian split squat so instead of just doing it freeform as I just showed you you just switched to a positioning here next to a rack next to something that you could actually just grab on to and hold on to it again not to pull myself up but just to stabilize my body so I balance component out of it next we hit the classic pull-up but you might be thinking how can you make the pull-up better well we can make the pull-up better because we can actually increase the stretch reflex that we get on the pull-up by just doing something that all of us can do on a single rep of a pull-up and that has just changed the positioning of our pelvis prior to the rep so we have a twisting pull up here and all you have to do is twist in one direction or the other and then pull in that same direction so if I twist towards the right as you see me doing here then what I getting a little added stretch reflex on the right side because as the pelvis turns back to the right and my arm stays in front of me we stretch on the lat on that side as soon as we do that take advantage of that stretch reflex and pull hard with the right arm to try to pull yourself up in that direction then we twist to the left and we do the same thing but now we pull towards the left arm and again this asymmetrical pulling here is actually more functional than we usually find ourselves in in some situation where we may even have to scale some kind of a wall we don up we one arm or the other depending upon the orientation of our body so I don argue that this is even a more functional version but the key again is we it we adding that additional stretch reflex that just does not exist in a regular pull-up and then finally this one is near and dear to me because I am someone that suffers from a lot of knee pain but when we do lunges we don abandon this exercise because knee pain is undercutting us once again because the lunge is a great exercise it definitely athletic movement for our lower body but there whenever we lunge forward anybody that has knee pain will know and be able to sympathize you might get a burning or stabbing pain in the front of your knee as you step forward and that because you force anteriorly right through that patellar tendon but what we can do is I reverse lunge is immense because what we same mechanics at the lower body but we directing it backwards away from the kneecap but we still want to be able to alternate and keep this movement going so instead of going back and just doing alternating reverse lunges we can turn it into a situation where we turn it into a combo exercise so that when I do come forward I switch legs and now I work on a sprinter lunge the value of the sprinter lunge is as you lean forward and tilt into that sort of Sprinter take-off position you loading the posterior chain you again taking the force off of that anterior knee eliminating the pain that you might feel but at the same time turn this into sort of an anterior posterior combo that straight lunge by itself so you to alternate back and forth again a more athletic version a better version and more importantly a safer version in the long run for your knees so there you have it guys there are five exercises that you are likely doing you should be doing lots of them but hopefully as of today you out of them because five little simple tweaks is all you need to make to make them even better guys it exercises and how you do them that gives you the differences that you see here

The Best Home Back Exercise Ever! (MADE BETTER)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjkZUmzvb1M	ATHLEAN - X	What athleenex.com. Today we cover the absolute best home back exercise and how to make it better. Now, you probably can figure out what this is right off the bat. All you have to do is look up. The pull-up is no doubt the best home back has one of the best back exercises, period. But it something you can do at home if all you do is go out and invest in a pull-up bar. But there Most guys will train the exercise only within the rep range that they to do. So maybe you two or three. That want to try to get stronger. Or worse, maybe you or 20 or more and all you do is ever train to failure in those ranges. You guys know that I believe training to failure is important, but sticking in the same rep range all the time, as we to cut it. So, you have to have a way to load the exercise in a way that you can make it more difficult. Now, remember, loading doesn additional weight. You can load with more resistance. And what we do is utilize the setup that I you right here. Here, I bands to the busters of a stairway. Now, it just so happens that I have these two bands in close proximity here to my pull-up bar. You could do this by pulling a piece of furniture over closer to your pull-up bar by taking a couple dumbbells. If you happen to have some heavier dumbbells at your house in your home workout setup, put them there. Guys, I can for you how you Just figure out a place to anchor these bands. Like I said, it could be a simple piece of furniture, but you take them and what them back low and behind you. With them low and behind you, put one band over one shoulder. You put another band over the other shoulder. So now I resistance here back and down. Now what our pull-up, we have to a pull ourselves closer to the bar. So we midback to work a little bit more than we traditionally would. And then of course we have that down uh anchor point that We got to be able to overpower and come up. So we get ourselves in position. We pull up. We close to the bar and up. Close and up. So again, normally I can crank out uh over 20 25 pull-ups in a shot. Not if I do it like that. But that here. We overload in a lower rep range to get the benefits. You don when you thing we can do is take one of the bands. Like I said, for the guys that on the lower end of this that can enough pull-ups, just anchor one over the uh the bar. You then step into the band and then you come up and now you doing assisted pull-ups. So, if pull-ups are always difficult for you, now they become much easier because you unwinded your body. So guys, when you training at home, you might have a few challenges that the guy at the gym doesn you can of fact, with our athlete zero program, you don this. You need absolutely nothing. And I can still get you the greatest workout that you could do in the comfort of your own home. And we will help you to build muscle by doing them. Guys, no excuses. Use these uh two methods here and adjust accordingly. And if you that complete program that you can do, no bars, no bands, no bench, no bull, athleenzero is at athletex.com.

Lat Pulldown Lowdown (WHICH WAY IS BEST?)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paIQfKZ4xC4	ATHLEAN - X	what another athl Express video for you today we down you go into any gym you doing this exercise so many different ways but there there can do to make the exercise look and feel different first of all we have a lot of different options you see I can do this exercise with a rope and a really narrow grip or I can do this exercise with a straight bar like I showing you here or I can even do this exercise with separately controlled dual handles like I show you here but that not all I can also change the direction of where I pull these things I can pull them behind my head as I here or I can pull them in front of my body or I can pull them through my body as I show you here right in line with my ears lastly the angle of my body can be different I can be pulling this thing with my body upright or I could be pulling whatever implement it is with my body lean back or even in some cases guys will move forward to back during each and every rep the thing is which one is right well that this video and I want to make sure I cover that here for you so you can identify it specifically for you the next time you do it okay let showing one thing we don we can eliminate one of the options and that guys is the behind the neck version I about the behind the neck shoulder press the troubl in position that that type of exercise puts your shoulder joint in remember we have a scapular plane which is a little bit in front of our body that our arms like to be elevated in whether they they in this joint and they same way we want to try to get those uh those arms in that position so putting our arms way back behind our head to do a lat pull down is directly going against what we same thing as I said that applies to the behind neck shoulder press so first of all get rid of that option that makes things a little bit easier what are we have the version in front of our body or the version through our body and that is determined by what is your goal you see when you are more upright your lats are more in advantageous position to do the work okay your lats are going to want to pull down adduct bring your elbows down into your body if we want to get more of the upper and midback you can see as I show you here the upper traps the rhomboids the lower traps all the are actually doing more work when I start leaning my body backwards it almost like a reverse incline bench if you thought about with the incline bench works it obviously works right here about this level of mus of muscle here on our upper body well when we start to do the exact opposite like we are with the uh a LP pull down done that way then we the other side around the same level so we want to make sure that if we trying to Target the midback you do it with a little bit more of a lean back position but if if you lat size and definition guys then you need to be more upright so that brings us to the third part of the equation here and that using or what attachment should you be using for me again if you lat development you need one that allows you to stay upright and therefore pull down and through the head so as I show you here I head only optimally with the Dual handle attachments because I can actually pull them right in line with my ears and keep them right down the midline of my body something I with a bar unless I have one of those special bars that has the bend over the top of my head you probably won that in most commercial gyms if we trying to work again midback it to use either the Dual handles or a rope or the straight bar attachment because it really doesn going to fall in front of your body and all three of those will work just as well as the others so there you have it guys we don exercises are we tell you why you should be doing them and what the reason should be for you to make that decision that what athletex is about it putting signs back behind the strength so you guys have a different appreciation understanding for what it is when you get a complete program that trains you and shows you exactly what you should be doing and why then head to athletex docomo and grab our 90day training program in the meantime guys if you found this video helpful make sure you leave a thumbs up and if you want to see me break down more of these exercises in this way then let me know what is it you happy to do that in a future video all right guys I meantime I	Success
8 Best Exercises for the Zombie Apocalypse (BE READY!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i3bU5zV8sI	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what Halloween and we kind of you see if the zombie apocalypse came would you be able to survive it or would you wind up looking like him I going to show you today the eight best exercises that you need to know you need to be able to do if you avoid this fate and instead survive it by training like an athlete let over from top to bottom okay so first off if you want to avoid being zombie bait you to run there don for long distances I want you to be able to run with some athleticism to it as well so we do s runs and an srun is exactly what it sounds like you have to be able to run fast but at the same time move your body in space be a little bit more athletic make an S back and forth as you run you do these 10 times as fast as you can and you this zombie apocalypse workout next up we can to be able to out quii the zombies right our feet have to be fast we have to have agility and we can actually do this in a small area of space with our agility line drill we along the same line changing the maneuver that we do each time down the path or each time down the line you can see we and shuffles back in the opposite direction then we can back pedal back the same line and of course we can drop our hips Get Low nice and athletic and swiv those suckers so we can do a karaa right and a karaa left back down change up the combination you and down and again you some good quick foot agility work to be able to outrun these guys and out quii them next up we team athleen right so if you your buddy and he falls down don selfish bastard pick him up and help him we need to have the ability to do a shoulder carry if we to help so what we do is we take a heavy dumbbell we our shoulder and we you you carry it as far as you can you carry 30 steps if you have the ability to do so even if you can access of space and just walk in place then when you get there Drop it Down clean it back up to the opposite shoulder and do it again for 30 steps try to do this three or four rounds without having to put the dumbbell down and you friends against being eaten alive by those zombies so you got to be able to run and you got to be able to be a good friend but you also better be able to jump and you being able to jump on something but sometimes you have to be able to jump over something so do this incredible box jump and over combination start by jumping up onto the Box land on the opposite side turn right around and then jump over the box if you on a bench obviously it than having to clear a whole box but whatever it is find a surface that you can jump on and then jump over and you being able to teach your body the ability to be explosive when you need it the most next up part of being able to stay alive is being able to not be heard in the first place try to keep yourself under the radar and I mean literally under the radar by doing the creeping lunge I variation of a lunge is going to put your legs under more time under tension requiring you to stay low try not to elevate your head very much as you perform each alternate step you see the idea here is to stay low stay quiet don you fate here in the zombie apocalypse okay let suckers running around you may not be able to outrun all of them so you better have some weapons in Your Arsenal to be able to deal with them if they close from you the first you better be able to climb and I climb up and over something out of sight we need to be able to do pull-ups and not just regular pull-ups but pull-ups with any single grip because you don know what grip is going to be awaiting you at the top of that ledge so I want you to do mixed grip pull-up medley here so start with both hands overand and do a regular pull-up switch one hand underand now you one side do another pull-up now switch the other hand underhand now you looking at an underhand now a chin up now switch that hand over now you looking at the opposite mixed grip continue to rotate through these as many times as you can until you reach failure so you can build up the strength to be able to climb and scale away from whatever is awaiting you down below oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] okay so now they grabbed your leg cuz you couldn they pulled you down and now you on the ground face to face what do you do you better start swinging my friend you better be able to do so with some power so we have our wood Chopper swings and this is a great core exercise rotational core exercise for developing the strength from your toes all the way to your fingertips and being able to be worth a damn when it counts so start here rotate to one side explosively if you anchor this band or this cable higher up you not just come across your body but to come across and down thus the wood Chopper if you don you can only swing across hell do what you can just start working on your ability to develop powerful rotational strength okay so uh the climbing away from didn swing fast enough the engine Ed you now you last shot my friend you better be able to drag your body away from them or its curtains so what we dead man push-ups with the dead man push-ups you away every time you crawl those feet will stay close together and not active they push through them anymore you to crawl forward one step at a time and do a pushup crawl another step do a push-up drag your legs all the way behind you and try to keep going as far as you can until you reach failure if you fail I I I don the fact of the matter is that you gave you your best try and that all about here guys and if you notice the the the similarities here what I got you doing here all kidding aside Halloween aside you athlete you and getting stronger at them you got to be able to run you got to be able to jump you got to have strength you got to be able to maneuver out of any position you got to be able to move in three dimensions this is what training like an athlete anything maybe the zombie apocalypse who the hell knows but preparing you for the game of of Life at the very least if you that head to athletes.com right now start training like an athlete start seeing the differences and start seeing what it looks like when you start training like an athlete all right guys we days in the meantime if you like this video leave your comments and thumbs up below and let me know what it is else that you channel I days and weeks ahead all right guys don come back next week see [Music] you	Success
ACL Tears (REHAB TIPS AND BEST EXERCISE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaACJok0T48	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com today we all about ACL injuries in a continuing effort to bring you guys a little bit inside of my life and what best friend here Charlie he had an ACL tear he I knee why this happens what you can do about it and most importantly what you might be able to do soon after it happens to you to help speed up your recovery like we with Charlie all right guys so my best workout lately has been carrying this guy around all 80 lbs of him because he tore his ACL I know how debilitating this injury can be especially if you there but don company CU it got this going on it popular injuries that you can possibly get orthopedic Al so learning how to deal with it especially if you watching this having dealt with this injury in the past is going to be helpful all right so Charlie going put you down for one second big boy he already falling asleep in my hands the most important thing about our knee is it single step we take if you you got a lot more than just steps you cuts and you have to be agile you have to be able to push and change direction well a lot of times the ligaments that run inside of our knee are are the only support we have against those forces that are caused by the change of Direction and unfortunately sometimes the forces are greater than the strength of our ligaments and we have issues so first of all I want to show you guys what the ACL does so you can get a better understanding of it because the thing that always amazed me was there are no mistakes when it comes to our anatomy everything is placed exactly where it should be for an exact reason because it serves a very specific function so if you want to look at your your knee and as you will with this rubber band here this is going to be the top part of your uh of your knee joint your femur and this is going to be the bottom part of your knee the tibia if you were to put a rubber band over your thumb okay and then make a fist and then from here wrap it around your index finger of your tibia when I then put them together we runs from the back side of the T of the femur okay behind our knee in the upper part of our leg and it runs and attaches across to the inside front of the tibia so what happens is we know first of all if I try to pull the uh tibia forward on the upper bone in our thigh the femur it doesn resistance there the ACL is trying to prevent that from happening it also will prevent this is one of the things that people don rotation of the knee so if the foot is planted and the leg turns out to the side right you want to change direction plant your foot and then turn to the right to push off that way you internal rotation down the knee and you can see that there band if I were to try to externally rotate my leg right there tension on the ACL so understanding the placement of the ACL in the knee will tell us everything about its function and what we need to worry about so what happens when this ligament that runs again from Back to Front tears well we don some of you guys out there can imagine we also get damage to the medoc collateral ligament that usually winds up getting torn to in a very severe ACL injury and we get damage to the meniscus that sit on top of the tibia here because once we lose that control of internal rotation we get a grinding of the two bones together that to basically grind and tear the surface and my friend Charlie he actually had a miniscus tear as well that had to be repaired so the most important thing that you can do when you have an ACL injury is to control the inflammation right now with Charlie we anything but trying to keep him limited on his walks make sure that what he does is just enough to be outside and get some weight bearing cuz we know that early weight bearing is definitely going to be useful and more uh able to accelerate your recovery than some of the older approaches that casted you and didn restricted your motion we want to get some weight bearing but you definitely going to want to make sure that you inflammation because the worst thing about inflammation is it shuts down the whole operation as soon as your body senses out uh inflammation even in the knee in cases of uh just interarticular uh fluid right we can get that from time to time water on the knee you function of the muscles around it most importantly the quadriceps once the quadricep stops to function you don really have the a good ability to straighten your knee and when you lose that you can actually start to develop scar tissue and have your knee shortened in a contractive position and if you don whole other issue in and of itself but first and foremost you got to control the inflammation so once we do that and we start to progress ourselves to work on the range of motion we able ble to get full knee extension first then start worrying about the flexion in our knee second all right Remember full knee extension first then start worrying about that you can work on full knee extension by literally pushing down on your leg trying to get it to straighten out but really what you guys watch our channel for is strength and conditioning and what are we really doing strengthwise to help with this ACL to hope hopefully make it come back stronger and faster well we want to make sure that we exercises versus open chain exercise you guys have heard me talk badly about the knee uh knee extension a lot and I feel for good reason in a case here for for the ACL there on that that the sharing Force placed on the tibia in a knee extension that we just don plus I always feel like you want to strengthen yourself in the a position that you likely got hurt in and that was likely with your feet on the ground okay 70% of the as injuries come from a non-con injury it cutting and your feet on the ground we want to be able to strengthen that knee with the foot back in the condition it was when it got hurt to try to hopefully prevent that from recurring so well I going to have you doing squats and I think the best version of a squat that you can do is going to be a front squat because if we can put that center of gravity a little bit in front of our body by bringing that weight in front of us and having a more upright stance as opposed to a back squat where we going to be sitting our hips backwards more you perceived stress by the ACL in that position which will allow you to load up quicker strengthen your quads and return to action faster with a stronger more functional leg than you might if you focusing on back squat so if you haven T your ACL I hope you never do we actually have a video on testing your intrinsic knee strength to see how well you might be fortified against a possible knee injury or ACL tear you going to want to watch that video I post it here as well so there you have it guys the ACL what it is how it functions what you have to do if you hurt yours and that you most of all it so you want to make sure you don in the first place guys if you want to look like an athlete you got to train like an athlete doing that in my book means training safely and P pushing yourself to the limits but do it in a way that allowing your body to become a bigger stronger version of yourself while also fortifying it against these types of injuries if you haven head to athletex docomo faster more Rift but at the same time let me as a physical therapist guide you so that you can become a more functionally strong version of yourself as well all right guys give TR a little bit of love he real soon in the meantime I one hell of a bicep workout holding this guy up and carrying him wherever he needs to be but he I here in just a couple days whatever you guys like to see leave it down in the comments below and I you see you guys	Success
Pre-Workout Ingredient Showdown (WHICH WORKS BEST?)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOgJIuu0qJs	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what so what should be in your pre-workout allinine or citranet I answer that question for you here in a very simple way today I to get simple even though we have some complex things that happen inside of our bodies that if we can make it simple and understandable then it can actually grasp and gives you a better understanding when you approach supplementation so line let there why do people take it in the first place well the argument is that we were trying to increase nitric oxide and nitric oxide is a vasod dil has a vasod dilating effect in our bodies which will increase the muscle pump and that people will rely on these types of uh ingredients in a pre-workout so we get nitric oxide from here and we get citrine and we do that with an enzyme that have is the citrine can actually be converted back by another enzyme back to allinine this all looks so great but the problem is this is what our bloodstream when the all arginine is in our bloodstream this is what on but guess what we got to get it into the damn bloodstream to start and that the problem because unless we this via intravenously which I hope you hard time getting this to the bloodstream because it has to go through our digestive tract and when it does it goes down a different path it goes down this other path that enters the ARA cycle so here the allinine gets broken down into ornithine which is a amino acid my handwriting sucks I know that and it also gets broken down into Ura which is a waste product the ornithine can actually be converted back into citrine and the citrine can be converted into allinine again but you can see that this isn nitric oxide so what happens is when you take allinine by mouth in a supplement you it matter of fact you studies will show about 30% of what you even if you 10 gram of allinine you winding up with about three grams of it so that matter of fact there was another study that showed guys that have high cholesterol were only maybe retaining up to 1% % 99% wasting of this taken this way so what we kind of counterintuitive what we would think is that the better way to get here is to actually start with the citrine which will convert to L Arginine whether this way or this way which then will become nitric oxide but the thing and the advantage that the citrine has is that it actually bypasses the same metabolic pathway that the allinine kind of got ruined by so it bypasses the digestive tract it bypasses the liver in this way it actually gets to the bloodstream and can have this effect in a much more uh in a much more effective way you 300% increase some studies will show the numbers are all over the place the idea is this guys you of a lot more retained from the citrine to get to the nitric oxide than you would otherwise so the the it doesn even really end there because we talking about citrine here in supplementing with citrine mallate so I haven mallate part and all that is is citrine itself is just a free form when you Bond it to malic acid in its malate form then what we get is citrine malate and what the malic acid does it actually provides a second benefit this benefit is that it feeds something called the kreb cycle and the kreb cycle just think of it this way it energy for your cells especially for your muscular contraction the kreb cycle will produce ATP ATP we know is another good thing to help with creatin so if you more important to be taking cine mate so you effect but you endurance effect as well so you getting more energy more prolonged energy from taking citrine malate versus a plain citrine but clearly in terms of the choice between allinine or citrine malate the citrine is going to win out hands down in the CIT malet of course even more so so lastly I with this two things one on dosing and one on sort why were we even doing this in the first place the idea behind the muscle pump it guys the muscle pump is actually the nitri oxide itself is creating a vasil dilation it that kind of surround our arterial walls to to loosen a little bit so that you get a a larger vessel that will allow more blood to flow through that will go to your working muscles and help you to train at a higher or harder level the idea is also the fact that in your blood since is composed predominantly of water you those muscles as well so that the main benefits it pumped but it nutrients and more water to those working muscles about dosing I this no matter what you better make sure your dosing is proper because what say we science back in supplementation here at athl X I could take an aspirin for a headache that doesn going to work if I take 1/8 of a tablet of aspirin we know that aspirin will work but an eighth of a tablet is not going to do a damn thing if you to benefit from supplementation you better make sure you right dosing the dosing that by research you better be looking for about six to eight gram of citrine mate if you want that dose looking for one gram two grams is not going to give you the effect and the benefits that you looking for from taking C melee in the first place so I hope this cleared up the confusion or any any sort of idea you might have had about the difference between the two some guys don know anything about them before watching this video but now I hope you do if you are looking for supplements that put the science back into supplementation guys I say it all the time here at athl next I try to back up what we do and not just sit here and talk but educate you as to why because I think the more informed you are the better you terms of making the right decision for you our supplements are over at are over at athl rx.com in the meantime if you found this video helpful leave your comments and and thumbs up below and let me know what other things can I cover for you here in these supplement breakdowns what other things that confuse you what would you

(YOU DECIDE)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ntdqhGtJ2I	ATHLEAN - X	could your leg training use a little kick in the ass I today how the kickstand variation of the squat could be exactly what you [Music] need what aex.com yes Jeff Cavalier I know you may not recognize me fully clothed here but I going to stop me though from giving you guys the workout that I want to get you each and every week so that being said today we in the open the kickstand Squat and what it following me for any length of time will know how important I believe single leg training is when it comes to getting results not just results in terms of leg size and leg strength but functional leg size and functional leg strength right we always talk about Athletics and a good portion of the time you are competing or doing anything athletic you always find that it important to work that type of training into your workouts you know no matter what you guys are extremely humbled by what happens to the weight that they can lift when they do single leg exercises so whether you squat I other videos before other techniques you do have to drop the weight well A variation we program that includes no weight at all and no no uh no equipment at all is sort of an assisted version of a squat but if you want to get back into the gym and lift a lot of weight and still get the benefits of single leg training you do a kickstand variation of the squat so what it looks like is basically you stack up a couple plates here I I got 235s about two or three 3 4 in off the ground I is in a second he put one foot up on top the other leg is going to basically act as a kickstand okay so it but it start up on your toe okay and you just going to come straight down as you normally would I got all my weight distributed right here on the left leg how do you test that you should be able to pick this foot up off the ground if you can ground that weight on it okay now I can okay so what we do is we get ourselves back over here weight centered around that left leg in this case kickstand down here the reason for the plate is so that when I go down I don to involve too much knee Bend here if I was doing it straight on the floor those extra few inches on that back leg would come into play but not up here on the two plates so they down little kickstand going on the right side but all the work being done by the left straight down I can maintain good me mechanics okay again I that the the the talk about knee going over the toe that up that leg if you don leg over there and all the weight is over here it becomes far less of a concern okay the patellar tendon is at far less uh risk mechanically at that point if you weight down into it so even there though I again straight down kickstand come up out of it it to work on that all important single leg strength without having to cut your weights down dramatically like exercises like the Bulgarian split squat so you can still feel big and mean when you doing your leg training but you can still get the benefits that you need to to look like an athlete and function one I going all right guys if you haven already you want to start looking like an athlete Now is over it well ahead of the New Year head to aex.com right now and grab your 90-day training program in the meantime I going to go try to get better uh more workouts will come though next week as always regular schedule I don they have to roll me out of bed all right guys leave your comments down below and a thumbs up and I back here in a few [Music] days [Music] he	Success
The BEST Total Body Exercise (You're NOT Doing!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjdF3nzBwek	ATHLEAN - X	with the hips literally and figuratively at the center of everything we do it goes without saying today most important one that you is going to involve the hips let me show you what I mean [Music] today what athleen x.com the most important exercise that you going to show you here today now what got me to thinking about this and the reason why I thought it was worth a video to instruct and show you this was the uh video I did over the weekend which was the top 10 biggest workout fails and one of the ones we covered in there was the rpdl which I call it right and I showed you the importance of the the hip hinge right when we hinge our hips we can hinge straight down like that here or we can hinge with a backward uh movement of the hips as well that much so that I thought why don you how to actually train that and how much of a carryover that actually has and we do that with our bands now if you guys don you can find them over at our website in our training bands uh section but basically they resistance bands enough to resist your own body weight and we already have one hooked around something sturdy okay this is around a swift machine it could be around a squat rack something that going to move now I demonstrate with two bands if you just starting out and you use this act this exercise as an activator right a glute activator and you you strengthener you bands all right so basically we just take it around put it right inside of itself like that and it around now we take both of them and we this put them around our hips and then kneel on something that knees so basically the importance here guys is two things number one you want to feel what it hip with the backward movement of the hips like I showed you in that second demonstration so think about it when you going to do an RDL when you do anything even a bent over row you shouldn from the hips which is what a lot of guys will do especially with the bent row with a bent row you want to get that forward with the with the trunk but backwards with the hips that will set up that arch in your low back right here that you need for a bent row if we go into a squat right it should feel as if the first move is down and back so when I resist against this band here if I let it go it down okay same thing for the RDL it going to pull me back and down that the perfect position so number one it going to teach you what it first hip hinge backwards as opposed to all in the forward Direction it to protect your back as we talked about in that other video the second and most important thing here is glute activation that and I here after I let it go the exercise is contract the glutes to squeeze your hips forward and again with two of these bands on here that wanting to pull me back down here right right so we get up up tall we to let it drop back and then squeeze forward all through the glutes Let It Drop back squeeze forward all through the glutes you got to hold it again this is a great activator right for the guys that have glute Amnesia which we talk about all the time underactive glutes lead to a whole mess of biomechanical issues between how the hips function from our feet up through our hips to our arms so if you have bad me mechanics right here in the center guys you going to have bad mechanics overall and it could lead you to get injured through any of your exercises upper or lower body so again let it drop down and then pull through again Contracting with the glutes if you look at it from the side you just letting the band take me down and then as I come up I through the glutes against the resistance of this band you want to make it a little bit more applicable to what you dumbbells just to feel it put the dumbbells up here put a bar up here an empty bar feel what it into the squat the right way come up and out of it squeezing through the glutes take your dumbbells RDL let them come straight down to the mat in front of you okay squeeze through and drive the hips through so barbell row again come down in here feel it like that okay what the feeling is like and then of course just the exercise itself will drive you back through and use your glutes finally guys what I wanted to show you is when you translate this to an exercise like a step up if I come up here and I put my foot up on my Surface to do my Ben step up or whatever I move the move is up and then drive through the hip everything we do guys functionally in the weight room once you the athletic position we call it the breakdown position is here right hips back you don position like this because what will happen is they their center of gravity is all forward as soon as someone hits them here they center of gravity is back and my hands are out that but if you don never going to ingrain it and that important thing here guys engrain this movement use this to wake your ass up like I say wake your glutes up as an activator with one band or if you want to incorporate it as a strength training exercise then start doing it with two guys we train athletes here but they all don okay a lot of you guys that are out there watching just compete in everyday life right wanting to get better at what you do want them to feel better at what you you know how you feel today that what it the core of it all it principles of training like an athlete that you then apply to your everyday life and it has a long-term effect on how much better you stronger you athlet next.com and that our 90-day training program so if you haven over there right now and grab it I see you guys back here in just a few days in the meantime let me know if you find this helpful try it out I you feels like to

Best Arm Workout FINISHER! 1 Move to KILLER Biceps and Triceps	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v24iuBmozPo	ATHLEAN - X	Could your arms benefit from a boost? Well, I you can throw a twist into your arm workout, literally, with this killer combo bicep and tricep exercise. [Music] What Here we are, days away from the Super Bowl. And it got me to thinking, I going to be watching this weekend with a particular interest in the quarterbacks. And I started to think back to some of the exercises and drills that we used to do with my quarterbacks, with any of my throwing athletes, my pitchers, to really show them how involved the core was in any type of throwing motion. Because I think when you grasp that, it allows you to become a much more effective thrower. Well, one of the drills that we used to do relied on simply either a handle on a cable machine or I do it at home even with a a band that has now sort of evolved into more of an arm building exercise, but the principles stay the same. And it fact one of the best arm exercises you could do because it both your biceps and your triceps in one move and also, as you carry over a lot of that core, too. So, here high. If you hold one second. I how you can do it at home. But you basically position yourself away from here. Now, we know the throwing motion, the throwing motion comes in in this direction. Whether you player or whether you player, it of the arm changing a little bit in the direction that the elbow faces. But the fact of the matter is there rotation and a lot of core involvement here. So, we exercise off of that and then build it now into more of a muscle building focus for arms. So, what we do is position our arm here and start with a curl. Now, you rotate. And this is where the core really kicks in. Rotate and drive the elbow forward. At this point, when you tricep extension. Okay. What about this though is that we also get eccentric tricep contraction here and then eccentric bicep contraction here. So we go concentric curl rotate concentric triceps all the while we core back eentrically here eccentrically. So, looks just like that. And drive it forward, back and back. Drive it forward, back and back. So, again, working both sides of the arm in one single exercise. Now, I mentioned how can we do it at home? Easy. All you got to do is take a resistance band, hook it around anything sturdy. In this case, it need that. You can do it around any support beam or anything in your house. Do the same thing. Step out again. It sort of this position here. If I was a pitcher, this is center field behind me. This is the catcher down here. Get it in here. Curl. Do the rotation again. Same principle. Rotate as you drive your elbow forward. And then do your tricep extension. Same thing. Back slow here and back slow here and then back. The key is that you and obviously you biceps and triceps in the same exercise. Guys, sometimes we have to look to other areas. I always say with Athlete X, you have to look into the field of athletics all the time because you want to build muscle and look like an athlete, then you have to start training like an athlete. And a lot of the moves that these guys do and that you watching on Sunday will correlate extremely well to what you do here in the weight room. Especially if you apply some principles and some muscle science to them, you accomplish. Guys, if you haven already, see what real muscle science does for you by becoming a member of team Athleene and getting the Athletics X training system. I promise you in the next 90 days, you a transformation that you really haven felt before cuz I will show you ways that you can apply things just like this to create all new responses by your body in that 90-day period. In the meantime, I and I hope you enjoy the game. Last year, I was wrong. this year. Room for the ners. I probably just put the curse on them, but we crossed. And I in 7 days.

Chest Workout ÂFinisherÂ (BEST PEC PUMP EVER!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Nh8ulyzv7Q	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what you are looking to absolutely punish your pecs the next time you train your chest then this is going to be the video for you I but two ways to finish your next chess workout to ensure that you didn pound your pecs into submission but you pretty much left them for dead so we going to go about this a little bit strategically here at the end of your chess workout before you call it quits I want you to go back to the bench and we unilateral and a bilateral version of this the unilateral version is going to be perfect for the guys that maybe can feel their chest working as much as they should or they don they feel they want when they train their chest by doing it unilaterally you able to touch and feel and make sure you want but first off we with the bilateral version and you going to start with a compound movement here so we dumbbell bench press you this to 10 to 12 rep failure as I showing you here push yourself go as hard as you possibly can this is going to kick off your finishing complex right here now you go to fure you drop your dumbbells you come running right over now we got to go and stretch out the muscles that you just worked a great way to do this is to do it in the bottom portion of a dip my feet are actually touching tippy toes touching the floor here to support my body weight you should be in a prefatigue state already you just the end so we load your pecs under stretch guys if you need your toes down on the ground to offset some of that fine but get into that bottom position feel the nice big deep stretch spread out that muscle as large as you can get the blood flowing in that muscle because we take advantage of that in the next leg here in the final Lego of this complex and that is as you can see here a lower third cable crossover so now with all the blood pumped into that muscle we already allowed all the blood to flow in in that stretch that followed our compound movement now we in there we cross right here I bands cuz I want to show you that us you can do this at home guys if you didn have a dip station you could just use a corner uh the corner of a of a countertop in your in your kitchen you get into that bottom position there and you pump out the bottom oneir of the Reps do we avocate partial rep training all the time here guys absolutely not we want to basically create your own mini occlusion in the muscle here by not allowing the blood to continue to sort of flow out freely as we stretch the muscle all the way back out so we doing this by keeping the the contracted position going for higher reps you going to want to drop the weight from what you would normally use here and pump away as long as you possibly can I think I get to about 20 reps here and by the time I and I want to stop and that that that you out your workout now I mentioned before the guys that maybe couldn chest as much you might want to opt for the unilateral version of it and if you can feel it this this is just going to give you a second option for the unilateral version we a single arm dumbbell incline bench press and we thing we to 12 reps that fatigues our chest get that muscle working yes you done the work in the workout we to do one more round of it here to finish it in our finisher once you done with that you got to get to a stretch position here the stretch position for the chest to make sure that we stretch both the PEC major and minor is to get ourselves up against as I demonstrating here a squat rack or a doorway and allow your arm to slightly Elevate up that rack that way we can get the PEC minor stretched out as well here again we don here migrate forward that would defeat the purpose of stretching your Peck you want to get your shoulder back make sure that you keep your uh ball in Socket Set backwards by retracting your shoulder blade that will get a nice stretch on the PEC we hold it here 30 seconds and as soon as we feel like we much exposure here of this muscle stretched out to allow the blood to flow in now we want to try to get into that that shortened range again and pump out as many as we can we could do that with our cavaliere crossover we whole video on this exercise before it definitely my one of my favorite exercises and you guys on YouTube dubb this the Cavalier crossover because you tried it you got to do it guys it basically a the inner onethird of a crossover and you with a single dumbbell and just pulling up and across your body it shrug move but you move with your traps try to appreciate the move by squeezing or adducting your arm across your body even more so don think of it this way as a shrug think about squeezing adducting the arm further across the body which will also Elevate that shoulder up and across that again no matter which one you do you will definitely finish off your workout in a much different way than you probably used to and when you to progress and overload you got to come up with ways to do that shock your muscles challenge them with things that they definitely do do that if you for an entire system and if you looking for all the workouts before the finishers guys head to aex.com We Lay it all out for you all of our training programs we give you the how the what the when the where everything you need to do to make sure you get the best results from every single one of your workouts meantime guys you found this video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know what you want to see on this channel

Leg Workout ÂFinisherÂ (QUADS KILLED!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSuzCDjBDy8	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] What As if leg training wasn its own, along comes a finisher. Today, I punish your legs and put that finishing nail in the coffin when it comes to leg training. And one of the things we going to incorporate right off the bat in our finisher is a very overlooked but important element when it comes to leg training. And that is speeding things back up, right? We here with explosive leg training. A lot of times we tend to train our legs slowly, especially if you squats. You that fast. So, when we do our finisher, we kick it off here the way I think we should if we like athletes, but get the most out of our leg development. And we do that with a weighted squat, weighted jump squat. Now, I that we do this with a barbell across our back because even if we get the least amount of separation from the bar off our shoulders and off the back of our neck, it back down when we make contact with the ground. And I also don loading right through the spine directly on top of the spine that we make contact with the ground. So, we can do it with dumbbells and it actually sets itself up perfectly for the rest of the finisher because we drop set here. Weighted jump squats go right down into dumbbell front squats. So, we jump squats. You pick them right up into a dumbbell front squat. As soon as you get done with those and you go and you do 12 reps of those, okay? Then you come and you go right over to the wall here. And now it manhood. What kind of balls do you have to get through the rest of this workout? Cuz you you those same dumbbells, 40 lbs in each hand, until you can then guess what? It those dumbbells. You got a little bit more left in you to see how much more you coffin. This finisher complex can be done three times at the end of your leg workout. I know you looking forward to it, but I promise you it the finishing nail, like I said, in the coffin. So, starts off with the jump squat load. If you whatever your regular squat weight is for one rep max, let you two dumbbells. So, let split across too. You got 40 lb dumbbells in your hands. How you jumping? You shoulder width or slightly outside of shoulder width stance. You to try to get your legs way out here and jump cuz you wouldn But secondly, you dumbbells hang hitting the outside of your legs. So, you want to make sure your legs are right in here shoulder width. Then the key, you don short leg your jumps. You don basically come out of this position. And when you jump, you still have some bend in your legs. You want to be able to forcibly explode off the ground. Yes. Land softly again, but explode all the way up into triple extension so that your your legs are completely straight. You do that now with the dumbbells. Remember, eight of these. And we go right into the front squat. You only have to go down a quarter of the way into the squat, but it change of direction that makes all the difference. Okay. So, I squat. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Come right up. Front squat for 10. One. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. Right over to the wall. No rest down here. Get comfortable. Try to hang out there as long as you can. You down. That is not your cue to quit the set. Hang on as long as you possibly can. Now, when you reach failure, you these and then try to hang out body weight. Stop cheating, Jeff. Get your hands off your thighs. Again, you not your cue to drop. Your cue to drop is when your legs just absolutely give out and drop your ass down to the floor. So, as you can see, it if it was, everybody would do it. And getting bigger legs wouldn hard. But I can tell you this, it is going to require some effort. But if you do the right things, you more quickly your effort pays off. If you program that will get you results for your effort. I promise you that. Head to athletics.com and let me coach you with my Athletics training system every single day through every single workout to get the most out of you. And if you found this video helpful, if you like this leg workout uh finisher, it because you asked for it. You want more of the finisher series? I to you because I want to make the videos you guys want to see. You can see this just kicked my ass. There time through. I got two more to go. I see you guys back here again in just a couple days.

Shoulder Workout Finisher (WORKS EVERY TIME!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0_lZGmo9ag	ATHLEAN - X	What X.com. Today, I perfect finisher for a shoulder workout to help take you not just to the end of your workout, but through the end of your workout to that point where we create muscle overload. And that most important thing if you to add size. Now, you don seismologist to understand this technique because we call this the tremors technique. And know you don have to have a real background in earthquakes to figure that out, but it actually works very similar to an earthquake and how it affects your muscles. We know that with an earthquake, there that That earthquake is. And then people will still feel tremors around the area of the earthquake, usually a long distance away. Well, we can do the same thing here by actually creating sort of the epicenter in our weakest area of our shoulders. in this case going to most likely be for you your rear delt your posterior deltoid. So we weight that we would normally fail in in a 10 to 12 rep range for a bent over lateral raise. Okay, that is the guiding weight that we this set, this tremor set. And from there you move then up to a side lateral raise. Well, we know that a properly executed side lateral raise will actually have your arms traveling in a in a in a position here because again, I I have to in the future, but the proper position is actually with our thumbs a little higher than our pinkies, not the opposite way around, which will actually get a little bit of external rotation in at the shoulder and still keep some work going in those posterior deltoids. So, you of that tremor in the back even though you the medial del. Then of course once you go to failure there, you go up to a front raise. And now the front raise, we into the front deltoid, but we going to feel a little bit of that tremor carrying through into the side delt. And of course, all the way back to the rear delt because we haven between any of these legs of this journey. And then finally, we go to the all so simple overhead press, except at this point, fourth in line in our exercises, it becomes pretty damn hard. And yes, guess what? When you do these, you tremors still going on in the backside all the way back on the other side of your shoulder because of this cumulative fatigue. So, I will actually demonstrate it here for you exactly what this looks like in action. We dumbbells. Again, I ones that would allow me to fail in the 10 to 12 uh rep range on a rear delt fly. Okay. So, I so you can see what we I try to make almost a W here with my arms. So this this positioning here. All right. So I get a little bit of that external rotation at the top as well. 9 10 Let me go right up now to the sides. Right from here and up. I can feel it in the back too. Nice. 10 11 12 And now up to the front. Catch your breath. One 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 got 9 10 11 more Well, and now got going to finish them off with that really light 20 lb overhead shoulder dumbbell press. But it already killing me to get him in this position right here and press up. And I can already start to feel that way back in the back of my shoulders as well. Excellent. 11 8 9 and guess what? You rest about 30 seconds. Those are 20s. I come back down here. I grab my 15s. And then I repeat it all over again. And this is your finisher, guys. You go until the last set. I take my hands and I go through the motion with just as hard a squeeze as I possibly can get through here and the rear delt. Uh up here again for the sides. Really trying to squeeze as hard as I possibly could right at the top. Then come up to the front here and try to squeeze as hard as I possibly can and then go back up through the press one more time and squeeze as hard as I possibly can. And I can tell you right after a hard shoulder workout, it doesn any better than that. That is a great way to finish off a highintensity shoulder workout capable of taking you to that next level, capable producing growth for you guys. If you for ways to train intensely in a much shorter period of time, you got to start being being willing to trade in some of that workout length for intensity. You can workouts thinking that doing the same thing over and over again is going to give you better results. Unfortunately, it that you that jolt and you coach you through every step of the way, I our Athletics training system, and I will walk you through every workout, every technique I days. I hope you guys found this video valuable. If you want more like it, let me know. We got finishers for other areas as well. I bring them back to you here, right here on this channel. All right, guys. I see you back here soon.	Success

How to Stretch Your Pecs (AND HOW NOT TO!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV7l1sfEmO0	ATHLEAN - X	PEC major PEC minor most serious problems if you let these things get tight i stretch each one the best way what guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com today we the PEC major neither of which are unimportant especially if you want to maintain healthy shoulders in the gym you see these two muscles are going to wreak havoc on your upper body in your shoulders particularly if you don stretch them enough or more importantly you don I make sure that you do by the end of this video we draw all over my damn body and I to show you the stretches and exactly how you have to do them to get the most out of this okay so let Raymond here and look at the function of the PEC major right we know that there two portions on the PEC major there the sternal portion which is right here off of the sternum and if they come out here and they fan out to a place up here on our upper arm bone the humerus right about mid sternum so right here is where they a clavicular portion that comes down and attaches to the same thing so you can see that if these muscles were to pull they chest so now like I said I over my damn body don want guys I I hope these things do come out though if we take our muscles here and we look at them they they I told you about and from the clavicle they the point I told you about so when I contract you can see the muscles underlying this that doing they body well now we got to go across remember the functions of these muscles now you can see that if this were to get tight and addition to being able to pull this across it will also rotate this arm bone in right if it and it gets tight shortens it pull this in that way so that we get tight we have internally rotated shoulders like this internal rotation of our shoulders brings the whole shoulder forward now we move on to the PEC minor the PEC minor is actually much more important because we never address this muscle and this has I think far more deep reaching implications to our shoulder when we don looking where the PEC minor goes it goes from the third fourth and fifth rib right here to the coracoid process right here now the most important part of that is the attachment because the coracoid process of I Spit this guy around you can see it it blades it blade so what happens when this muscles pipe and they go from here to here and they so now we get an anterior tilt of the scapula so it down and in we rotation of the shoulder blade which is down this way okay down that way and then we so the shoulder blades going to come around our body this way and we won able to retract it so again look here now I got my PEC minor so I coming down from inside here coracoid process down here when it pulls in is pulling my shoulder in protraction forward is pulling it and tilting it down this way so now we get this real tilt forward of the shoulder it just an internal rotation that the PEC is giving us the PEC major but it actually giving this up pulling on our entire shoulder blade now go try to raise your arm up and guess how much you lack and your ability to actually do that a lot because you can major is tight you entire shoulder nice alright starting to say it so bluntly guys this is the truth your shoulders gonna take a beating if you don what I wanted to do is now show you how to stretch these knowing what these functions do because all you have to do when you stretch something is reverse the motion that the muscle is responsible for let me take you to show you how to do exactly that so you want to upwardly rotate your scapula that way okay here go up you don you want to retract your scapula you don to make sure that your posterior tilting your scapula and not anteriorly tilting it so we can do that the way we do that is we put our shoulder up here against something sturdy so inside of a wall will be perfect inside of a door jamb or a squat rack even as I a Smith machine doesn do it on but you should stabilize your the front of your glenohumeral joint here pushing it backwards so I nice position here ok so it stable up against then again I wall here ideally if I it them on the rack now I want to retract my scapula together behind me so if I do that you can see just here all I is pinching my shoulder blades back together we protraction if I do that now if I allow this to slide up then I get the upward rotation of the scapula - which is what we look what happens to the lines on my chest when I do this here I I rotation look at the distance now of the lines they because I can feel a nice good stretch right in there and again you hold it and you do you think 30 to 45 seconds ok now we going to go into the PEC major and the thing here is that it we want to stretch it but there things that you have to make sure you take note of because if you do this the wrong way you could actually wind up hurting yourself even more if you look at the PEC remember all we have to do to stretch the muscle is know where it starts and where it ends and we know it starts here and it ends here and it starts here and it ends here so if we can bring those two points further apart then we can get an effective stretch on the PEC so for the PEC major you want to position yourself again here in this doorway or whatever you able to stabilize the front of your shoulder on because we don this and this too much a lot of guys will find that when they do this all they do is shoot the head of the humerus to the front of the shoulder here and really start stretching out the anterior shoulder capsule that especially if you somebody that your shoulder joint so what you can do is make sure that that doesn forward this way by staying back set in the shoulder joint so we can do that by pushing up against here in the shoulder you know up against the doorframe or squat rack whatever you going to do then you raise your arm up to 90 degrees so now I lean forward into that stretch so I lean through the doorway this is keeping this set nice and back in the shoulder joint and I lean forward you can see the stretch if you want to intensify that all you have to do is look away and down so by peeking away and down I further stretch out in the chest from here to here it doesn the world whether I extend my elbow out here or I don if you do that is probably cause more likelihood that you that head of the humerus forward into the shoulder capsule and cause a problem so what you want to do is keep it in here it that you stretch by doing the fly and having your arms spread out far because it going to help with that stretch with the chest muscle with the PEC major you already reached the limits of its flexibility when you got to this point because this and this are as far apart as they do anything else for the distance between here and here so you stretch this out you do your chest PEC major stretch and you hold it for about 30 to 45 seconds and you continue to work on this guy said these muscles here they have a distinct command on the structure and the function and the posture of your whole entire shoulder girdle and if you do this and you allow yourself to get tight and you go back and do a lot of other upper body training you to wind up screwing up your shoulder so I don guys found this video helpful make sure you leave a comment and a thumbs up below I know it are the kind of videos that help you guys really understand what the hell is going on in your shoulder after all so that you can be more educated when you attack the gym and guys we take the educated approach here at athlean-x all of our workouts all of our programs every video we put up on this channel dedicated to helping to show you guys exactly how to do it so you know better the next time in all of our programs are dedicated to that too if you want to file and put the science back in strength head to athleanx.com and get her out the next training program Scott I quickest results in the safest way possible all right guys I here in just a couple days I hope you like this one I this shoot off of me now see	Success
Shoulder Stretch to Fix Your Shoulders (GET DEEP!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9yRiOeVvIM	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what athleanx.com if you get shoulder pain or discomfort when you you might be dealing with a tight posterior capsule today I show you first of all what the posterior capsule is secondly a way for you to test on your very own self without needing anybody to determine whether or not yours is tight and thirdly if it is I can do to help fix that now as far as a posterior capsule it is a capsule or structure that will contribute and tighten overtime to lead to this forward or rounded shoulder posture the way it does that is usually because of what going on with the muscles behind your shoulder so we know that rotator cuff muscles here is supraspinatus infraspinatus and teres minor they all come around here they wrap around and attach to the to the side of your upper arm here and they control its movement now we know that the rotation of it we know that if these muscles get tight they kind of will do this they of stay down tighten together taper down and almost push this forward well over time that leads to this kind of chronic shortening and tightening of that posterior capsule that deeper right inside here that again holds the the upper arm in place that a bad story though that situation because as I said anytime you lifting weights up overhead or even bench pressing you greater opportunity to start pinching some structures in here because you just don arm up again I asked you to do this a lot of times try to roll your arm in and then lift your arm as high as you can you show you now how to determine whether or not your posterior capsule is even tight in the first place which a lot of you will find that it is and then we can figure out a way to fix that okay so whether to figure out whether your posterior capsule is tight you going to want to do this stretch get on the ground here and you want to internally rotate your arm as far as you can right not just turn your wrist here or pronate your forearm but literally internally rotate your arm as far as you can now put it up here at 90 degrees take your other hand and hold your lat in place in other words try to keep your shoulder blade flat to the ground okay because you I push down and I have my arm internally rotated as far as I can now I reach across my body as much as I can and I portion of my elbow to cross my chest the midline of my chest so if I looking right here this is my target again I keep my hand in here in place all the way internally rotated and I trying to move across now for me I can automatically feel a lot of tightness right through the back portion here of my shoulder right here the back of my shoulder so what I want to do is again try to do that you can see if I allowed my scapula to come up off the the ground here then I could go way over that testing your posterior capsule guys because we know that your shoulder blade is attached to your shoulder so we want to make sure that we don happen we flexibility of the posterior capsule so if you could do this and you can it across the midline on your body then you stretch I can you don this what you might want to check is the tightness of your lats because we know that the lats are going to affect how high and house freely you can raise your arm up over your your head so you might want to check that tightness I often find that lats are really a commonly tight and it may not be necessarily your your posterior capsule so check that out that with but for the rest of you let to the third part of this and I actually going to show you the stretch okay so the name of the stretch is called the sleeper stretch it pretty easy to perform on yourself there get yourself set up right first you want to get 90 degree bend here at your elbow then you want to get your arm below 90 degrees just a little bit about 70 degrees abducted so away from your side this would be 90 degrees from my side I really important you want to lay here you can put something to your head to support your head here I just didn bring something with me at the moment but what you want to do is allow your body to pull your shoulder blade back okay so into retraction I a second here that here as you can see my back now doing that so I can actually pin the side of my shoulder blade the outside board or my shoulder blade down into the floor for the same reason like I said in testing the stretch you don have that become part of weight here if you posterior capsule you want to make sure that you blade to move so the shoulder blade stays pinned here into the floor then we take our hand that ups at hand we actually hold underneath our elbow here to make sure it stays in position you know I so that my shoulder blade can now all I do is I push down here through my elbow so I rotation here of my left shoulder now I don try to lift myself up because again now we move I literally just kind of let my elbow gently push down into my forearm and I can feel that again right in here through the back of my posterior capsule okay now we want to do is ultimately see if we you can touch the floor because you should have about 70 degrees of internal rotation but I could reach my fingers down as far as I can I can means I have to work on my shoulder capsular flexibility a little bit and mobility okay so that try to hold on to this stretch for about 30 seconds maybe three times do it a few times a week and you to see that your internal rotation will improve via the capsular mobility being improved not just stretching out the rotator cuff but actually working on the adaptations that have been caused by the fact that your rotator cuff has been too tight all along guys remember when you here you got to cover all the all the issues it it could be your mobility it about your mobility it could be about your strength it could be about tightness in areas that you considering so you want to make sure you have all your bases covered I try to help you guys do that here on this channel and of course I try to walk you through it all in our athleanx training program if you haven team athlean and you

Foam Roller Mistake! (Watch BEFORE You Foam Roll)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq6NcAoQDSk	ATHLEAN - X	so you finally listened and added the foam roller as part of your routine but what if I told you that this right here could be caused you more problems than you had that made you reach forward in the first place I [Music] today what x.com the foam roller it right we never has it been more true than it will be by the time you video how you foam roll means more than the fact that you alone okay because doing foam rolling in the wrong way can actually be more detrimental to what you were even doing it for in the first place in order to understand that guys I wanted to start by drawing a little bit here for you first of all this is the side view of somebody we second cuz first and foremost the way that fascia and muscles work together is the fascia is what overlies the the muscle belly and it sort of works in this type of way okay it a diamond shape and if you were to push on these ends right this way then these two are going to get further apart if you think about I picture here those um those uh Chinese finger uh traps right if you ever had your fingers in these things you try to pull them out what try to pull is these parts just get closer together it makes it harder for you to pull your fingers out of meanwhile the way to get out of that is to actually push your fingers closer together that makes expand in this direction and then your fingers can get out fasion Works in much the same way so again if you were to push this direction in this direction okay then these would go out to the side all right so now realizing how that fashion Works let take it over to a real world example that a lot of you guys I relate to we IT band and for those guys that don know exactly what that is it stretch of of uh tendonous structure that goes down the outside of your leg that will a lot of times result in pain especially for runners guys who do a lot of biking even people who sit for long periods of time you get that pain characteristically right on the outside of your knee okay right above that bony the bump right on the outside of your knee this guys beyond the scope of this video the IT band is really sort of being just put in the middle of a lot of different muscles that that attached into this tendon and what we have here is two at the top and two at the bottom I won bottom for now those are really the anterior tip and the uh pronus longest down at the bottom but again just for now understand that we have our tensor fascia which starts from here and we have our glute Max that starts from here and you can see they both feed into this right here IT band now here important point when it comes to the foam roller guys will just blanketly take out the foam roller as they instructed and start rolling away thinking that they the problem is again it bands get flared up because of this imbalance between the pull of all four muscles that are feeding into it so if we look at the tensor fashion this is more on the front side this is more on the hip flexion side this is the one that tends to get short and tight the problem is in Balance here in the back the glutes tend to the glute Max tends to get long and weak now if you think about how we talked about how muscle faster reacts to foam rolling basically if you are to go in the direction of the fibers here okay if I were to go back and forth this way you here of the muscle belly okay and then narrowing it so in this case all you doing is taking a long weak muscle the glutes and making them longer that is not an indication for why you the foam roller if however you took the short tensor fashion and you rolled in the direction of the fibers you would be taking a shorter tight muscle and increasing its length that thing but you can see that the direction of the foam roller makes all the difference if you just said I blanketly roll this thing up up and down my leg one you could be creating a benefit the other you could be furthering a problem so when it comes to something especially like the IT band and the same thing applies down below the knee if you blanketly roll over these muscles thinking that you thing out or improving the tissue quality I can tell you right now you not you have to have a bit more of a specific approach to what you uh than that so if I break out the foam roller here you can see that again with the glute max if I was going to take this foam roller and roll it in this direction right this is in the direction of the fibers down like that across the hip which is what a lot of guys will do you see them all the time they get on the thing and they roll it right across that if I wanted to try to tighten that a little bit obviously first and foremost strength training is going to be our best weapon to try to tighten and add some tone to that uh to that glute Max okay because again I always talk about glute Amnesia that in most people we could roll in this direction okay which would be against the direction of the fibers so if we did that that would basically stretch it out this way right which would pull it in this way based on this method over here right so if we do this it pulls it in that would actually give us a little bit more of a benefit what we looking for so glute Max don roll This Way roll that way tfl again this muscle goes straight up and down so if we go in the direction of that muscle group right there Then basically we are going to increase its length from top to bottom that some guys I take this foam roller and roll it right against my leg over here like this and just roll it right over the whole leg cuz I want to feel it the whole time that doing is sort of helping to shorten the structure that so again guys it makes a difference as I always say everything makes a difference how you train what you eat the way you sequence your reps the way you sequence your sets anything written on paper looks good until it and could become really bad real quickly okay that program could be any recommendation of foam roll anything that looks good on paper done incorrectly can be pretty bad so guys start doing taking a little bit more that second level approach or step to what you you you faster uh results and also uh a more significant step towards the direction you first place in this case looser uh and a better feel feeling it band guys if you haven that second step with me being your coach along the way then head to athletics.com right now and grab your 90-day training program see what it like to train like an athlete and to address these things as if it was your career like an athlete where all these things matter all right guys I you there in the meantime let me know what other types of problems do you suffer from if you want I can make that other video talking about the lower half of this from the ankle up and how that contributes to it ban as well or other issues that are B and you maybe we can discuss them here as we do sometimes with our PT type videos all right guys I [Music]	Success
The Ultimate Hip Stretch and Mobility Drill (PSOAS SOLUTION!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g70Jq2NjQwY	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com there of the biggest muscles in the body are some of the most important today we going to talk about the role of the psoas and not only why it but what you can do to make sure that yours is adequately flexible at the same time working on that hip as well all this is going to be extremely important for how you function in the gym or out on the field if you hips need to be mobile I say it all the time if you want to look like an athlete you got to Train like an athlete today I want to show you exactly how to mobilize that hip and work on that so is so that your lower body is functioning the way we need it to well start by taking a look on the skeleton exactly what the role this muscle is and why you need to start focusing on it all right so let take a quick up-close look at the psoas muscle so you understand why it important that we focus on it because it is big it covers a lot of ground and it has a couple of very major functions you can see that it runs from here all the way down to the top of our femur and what it does is it primarily will make our hip flex okay well lift our leg up into hip flexion but that attaches to all of these lumbar vertebrae here and into our thoracic spine so you see as I spin this around it comes right up here and it literally like I said attaches to the vertebrae well my attention to the vertebrae if we were to leave our leg fixed and can track from the top down you know pull from here we bending of the spine in one direction so you can see if there tightness between right side and left side of our psoas here it cause a compression on one side of the spine versus the other if they equally tight and they you spine and the discs themselves which can cause problems that back pain when they do their ab work if they have tight hip flexors so there way that we can actually stretch this big muscle out and improve the mobility of the hips at the same time and that not going to show you right now all right so if we this muscle then we have to go back to the functions I just showed you that on the skeleton you know you need to get your hip into it tension because this is a powerful hip flexor and we also want to get some lateral trunk bending because as I showed you if we allow one side of our sellers to work it pull ourselves down on the right hand side pull us down into lateral flexion of the spine so if we can get lateral bending of the spine in addition to hip extension then we for the sellers and a lot of people forget that secondary component because they think of it just from the bottom up as opposed to the function of it top-down so we can go to a smith machine and I love this machine for this very purpose because it allows us to quickly move the the essentially our bar will be our dowel about where we want this to be to help us do hurdle unders or hurdle overs or a lot of other variations of hurdles which are great for hip mobility so we but we stretch to make sure that we can get both the flexibility and the mobility of the hip address at one time so you set this thing up here I a frame here but you set it up in about hip height just at the crest of your hip so right up where your hip will crushed up that and obviously if you different people you slide it up and down based on their height now we want to do is position yourself on the outside here of the bar we hurdle under you try to keep your head and body squared up your feet will step in try to keep your toes straight on the line of the bar so straight ahead here towards the camera as I go under I want to then slide over rotate my torso so I can stretch the back side hip flexor you this way but I slide under i okay i slide my body over i don dump my head that mobility drill you under and then once you rotate your torso now I drop down on a nice stretch on this back hip flexor here and I direction okay so I out so I square up now I through here good hip mobility in through my hips I slide that way okay I drop in good hip flexor here on this leg good stretch I raise up remember this one to pull you down to the same side so when I I lean away from it so now I really good stretch and mobility down through both hips I ease up slide straight back down again over twist and go to the other side come up side down over up and move just like that up down slide here and come across like I said quick drill and tax the hip from both sides flexibility and mobility and again if you do it in here nothing stopping us from getting these a little bit lower and then working on over drills as well all right but that another day for now guys I want to I want to see that not only is this muscle important not only can you not ignore it but if you really want to start training like an athlete you got to address this component of your preparation as well be mobile be flexible and then start training you more if you have adequate mobile hips because they positions he may never been able to someone real big other important exercises like squats and deadlifts and things like that so if you Train like an athlete then head to athleanx.com and get our complete athleanx training system let me coach you every step of the way through every aspect of your training and I your goals

Rotator Cuff Stretches (The Ones You REALLY Need!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL3cIDFUafU	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com the rotator cuff a lot of guys have questions first of all they call the rotary cuffs the rotor cuff is the rotator cuff they want to know what is it what does it do do I need to stretch it so I need to train it well first let actually is if you look here another skeleton the rotator cuff is not a single muscle group it muscles the real which are going to externally rotate your shoulder and that thing when it comes to your training it supraspinatus the muscle above the spine of the scapula the infraspinatus right below the spine of the scapula let me have the teres minor and then on the other side here you can see we have the subscapularis this is one that runs running the underside of the scapula and it attaches to the inside of our upper arm bone so what that will do is internally rotate the arm so that was not actually doing us any favors because it that we already have as anyway that does that trains with weights consistently and that is internally rotated shoulders an unbalanced shoulder posture usually dominated into this internal rounded shoulder posture so we only have those three muscles on the backside and only those three that will externally rotate the shoulder and that because you posture whether you lat pulldown whether you for even a benchpress you need your shoulders back and down whether you squat you need your shoulders back and down the only thing is going to help you are these little muscles right here you got to make sure that you have been trained properly and that because most programs never even address the rotator cuff where they training program as a physical therapist I understand the rotator cuff is extremely important to what we do so we program it in to your regular training so you step so you can unlock a lot new a lot of other areas of strength that are being held back by your tight or weak or tender cuffs at the moment so what do we do if you have to stretch your rotator cuff well I have a couple stressors now the number one you shouldn external rotation component of it why unless you suffer from trigger points in your muscles like the supraspinatus and the infraspinatus which can happen you really deal with tightness in your external rotators because remember we talked about they just weak and on stretch the one that is going to cause you problems is going to be your subscapularis so we can do that with a golf club or a broom handle anything you basically take a golf club or broom handle whatever you have you hang it right over your shoulder as if you take your arm you put it at 90 degrees with the club still in your hand okay from here it should be almost dissecting your bicep you grab on to this club from underneath you pull up and back you now pulling your shoulder right into extra rotation so you can stretch the internal rotator of the rotator cuff which would be again that subscapularis so this is a great stretch to get in there I can really really feel it if you should need to stretch your external rotators you have to remember to do that you got to go the opposite direction you gotta get into internal rotation and we can do that by taking our hands as I going to show you here in this drench putting them right outside your hips okay the backs of your hands now you can see I was try to move my elbows forward okay as much as I can once I hit a limit here I the end limit of my internal rotation of my shoulders now to get this even more intense I can squat down you can see I now putting those elbows as if I can inside my knees and once I inside the knees I can use my knees to actually drive the elbows in a little bit more little further into passive internal rotation that can give you a pretty good stretch again you going to feel this if you that tends to carry a lot of stress in through your back trigger points that will reside in that infraspinatus and supraspinatus and teres minor it will feel good you address that but I can tell you long term the big thing you is strengthen these we have a video I make it right over here about strengthening the rotator cuff a little bit more about the importance of why we want to do that I can tell you most workout programs never address the rotator cuff as a physical thing I realize the importance that these muscles play and the fact that these are the only three friends we are the only three allies we combat against all this internal rotation that we rest of our upper body pushing and pulling workouts so we need to make sure that we don guys we don make sure we address at all its what training like an athlete is all about if you haven for balance shoulders and you to develop upper body strength without creating imbalances that are really hard to overcome I would head to athleanx.com right now and check out our athlean-x training system it create balanced bodies athletic bodies that not only look great but perform great too that guys if you want to look like an athlete you got to Train like an athlete and it starts right here and don muscle no matter how small it is

How to Stretch Your Triceps (AND HOW NOT TO!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvpW_zKJmI	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com today i how to start stretching your triceps the right way you see there that we run into we our triceps that discomfort in our shoulders or to do the stretch wrong in the first place here the one you probably see all the time right pat yourself on the back grab your shoulder and pull back right pull on your elbow grab it pull it across sometimes you can see people doing this and that few things wrong with this yeah I broke out the pen to help you visualize what going on you see a lot of times we pull when we getting this pulling of the skin that you feel and you interpret as a tricep stretch it grab your shoulder like this and just pull your skin as hard as you can grab here and pull you stretching your muscles out but all you the skin here that sensation so that you here and do that a lot of times that what you you heads of the triceps they all start here on the other side of the elbow okay on the ulna right here the electrode on underneath here crossing the elbow joint and then they die into the actual upper arm okay somewhere on the upper arm here here but they the shoulder so in order to stretch those out all you have to do is bend your elbow as soon as you bend your elbow fully you muscles because that do they only cross the elbow joint the one you really feel when you stretching out the triceps is the long head of the triceps that one starts in the same spot wraps all the way around and it actually crosses the shoulder joint too because it attaches right here just underneath the ball and socket joint okay just right here on the scapula on your back okay so we have to figure out if we if we go up here when we get into this position our scapula and this point are certain distance apart okay okay where it starts where it attaches to there certain distance apart if I just bend here and do this right like gravity I knew this these two points are moving together they is no extra stretch going on here because these two points are no further apart than they were when we started if we want to get them to move apart further what we have to do is we got to keep that that scapula down and depressed here as we move our elbow further away from that point so we can do that by positioning ourselves over here up against the wall or a piece of equipment where you grab hold of your shoulder blade you can do it you just reach around wrap for the meat and then pull down on your shoulder blade okay you try to set it in place once you do that now you bend your elbow all the way so we get the stretches of tricep going already we lean into a trend to a wall here and then we and then lean our body in okay my neck can be free here the point is that my elbows bent all I can and now by keeping this shoulder blade down and then leaning in and allowing the machine or the wall to push my elbow further away now I head of the triceps now I can feel it and I pulling on my skin now one complication that a lot of people will feel me included with my bad out bout my bad shoulder is that this is a hard position to get into in the first place so people that use that stretch and feel like there example another way to do it so we can do it here on the floor I have a foam roller setup that allows us to do exactly this so I come down onto the floor on a foam roller and the key is that if you can if you get shoulder pain when you doing the tricep stretch a lot of times is because you don mobility and what happens is is if you can shoulder to get it up you getting a little bit of an opinion feeling up there we try to stretch your triceps out another reason why that version of the stretch the first version the wrong version isn do that though with a foam roller because we can work on two things you probably lacking one is external rotation your shoulders just by getting onto a foam roller and letting your arms sink back over your your the foam roller here in a 90 degree position gives me some extra gravity assisted external rotation the second thing is you lacking thoracic extension right when your thoracic spine rounds you can elevate your arm I guy a lot of times you can physically elevate your arm because of the blocking that happens so if we get out of foam roller we got thoracic extension through the foam roller we got this passive sort of assisted gravity extra rotation now we can come back here and reach and then pull over okay and we again grab back and pull over from here I forearm at that point and I pinch my shoulder blades down and back it try to keep my scapula down as I try to pull back this way but it for me a little bit more comfortable because I have a better position through the thoracic extension here because of the foam roller so guys you got to start if you stretch out your triceps you want to learn how to do them right if you going to invest the time to train you better learn how to start training right we train like athletes here at athleanx.com and the whole point of this is want to make sure you right so I put all these videos together and put all the programs we have

IT Band Syndrome and Knee Pain (HOW TO FIX IT!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYb9vyj6zQ	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what today I want to talk to you about a pain that a lot of people will get either running or jumping or biking or when they at the bottom of a squat that runs usually on the outside of your thigh could feel really really tight or could burn and be very painful or right here on the outside of your knee you may have been told that what you have is IT band syndrome ilot tibial band syndrome and that sit here and I see it all the time I see people grab a foam roller here get on that side of that leg like this make all kinds of faces cuz it really does hurt and they think they fixing their problem when all they doing is actually making it worse because as you today the IT band is not something that you can change the tension in by directly attacking the IT band this is just a 10in structure that actually has the ability to resist up to 1,000 lbs of force so if you think that putting your own body weight on top of a foam roller or I don the lacrosse balls it ain anything to change what that IT band however if you understand where the IT band is in your body and what it actually does then you can start to figure out that maybe there better way to go after it the IT band is actually going to sort of of mirror this line of my pants here it thick ten t t uh tenis band that goes down again the lateral aspect of my thigh and inserts here on the just past um my uh onto my tibia past my knee joint so the things that happen here though is that we have muscles that feed into it so we have primarily the tfl the tensor fascia that and I cuz we if we want to fix it band syndrome once and for all and we also have a lateral aspect of our quads so our vasis lateralis we have our glute Max that feeds into it from back here we even have posterior hamstring because again if you look at this white line it feeds right into the white line from back behind and again as I said the quads feed into it from up top well all those muscles and primarily the ones from the top here again especially the tfl it uses this IT band as its own tendonous attachment to the aspect of our knee so you the tension in the tendon by going after the tendon but you can change the tension in the tendon by going after the muscle that attaches or feeds that tendon and that all of our time doing so if you getting pain like I said when running or biking or jumping or in that bottom portion of a squat and you don what looking up here at the hip and especially the tfl if you want to start making some changes so here two-step plan for you to really attack back that most of the time I find that the two biggest offenders of this IT band are going to be that lateral aspect of the Quad because a lot of times quads will get very very tight on most people especially those that are doing those activities I just mentioned and also really really big this tfl so the tfl actually this is what it sort of looks like or where it is I little bit here I little bit but the idea is right here is the iliac crest we have the top of our hip B you can actually feel it and if you reach around in front you should be able to feel a bump right here on the side of my you know I got these muscles kind of in the way but you can feel this bump on the front side of your pelvis that kind of grab a hold of there with your thumb and then make a fist in this general area is where our tfl is all right it very very big muscle but it feeds right down as you can see into that white line here which is going to be Our IT band so what we want to do is we want to get into position and put pressure on that we don necessarily but if you have a foam roller that that but what I like is something very low profile this happens to be a fat grips now I they happens to work really well this is very resilient uh material here it doesn really deform very much at all you can use tennis balls put together you can put the lacrosse balls and put them together but whatever Implement you using use it right and this is how we want to use this you find that area right there in the hip you sit right on top of it okay and you push your hip right there on on it okay so I feel it now pushing I feel pressure underneath now what we want to do is we want to kind of floss the muscle through its range of motion that it through when we run when we jump when we squat that means we have to flex our hip if we can we try to keep it in contact with the ground so I little bit so you can see this even more right here you want to keep this in contact with the ground and I basically flexing up and that hurts because I right Contracting the muscle and taking it through this sort of flossing I pushing down in this one spot and then dragging it under and through dragging the muscle under and through kind of rolling out the issues without just rolling back and forth on a roller and I with with that leg up and down this is really like an Active Release Technique an art technique we up and then down we flexion and we can do the same exact thing here by putting it down lower now onto our quads you just turn it uh in a long W Direction here so now you put it just to the outside so you on the quad here we after the IT band that side of our pants here cuz that going to do like I just told you you got to come to the front now we in the front now we try to do is take your other foot block your leg from moving further anymore okay and then try to bend your knee back so we stretch the quad that way now I don very very tight quads so I to feel this as much and if you don feel it move on guys the whole point here Mobility drills is to only do the ones that you need don doing mobility work work that you don need if you go through this motion and you don likely don don have a tight tfl though that might need to be addressed or it does need to be addressed if you want to start changing that overall impact that feeding down into the IT band so again you work here and you just go through that quad contraction the purpose of this leg is a lot of times guys when they bend their knee if they have tight quads will find that the knee will shoot forward because you some of the tension off of that quad that want to let that happen you want to keep it back in a stretch position and then Flex the knee but those are the two moves for me as a PT that I find most often are the ones that you want to address the tight vastus lateralis the outside of the quads and the tight tfl those will feed tension into the IT band making it really really tight without going having to go after and try to compress it with a foam roller on an already compressed structure that doing nothing but pushing down on the things beneath it that makes that pain even worse so guys if you take approach a smart approach to Mobility you got to start thinking through your Mobility a little bit more don somebody showed you do the things that you actually really need and that whole point here guys make sure that no matter what you you do the exercises that your body needs if you point Z you take the 26 letters of the alphabet and you do those things that gets you from from point A to point Z the fastest that here at athletex is give you guys a plan to get you from point A to point Z without any wasted motion without any wasted effort so that you can make sure that the most you out of what the time that you spend training guys if you program that does that head to aex.com and get our athex training system

How to Stretch Your Biceps (FEEL IT INSTANTLY!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e1hQUxTAHc	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what today I stretching your biceps the right way and let it biceps get ignored when it comes to stretching our muscles because we just don in terms of a muscle that we would stretch but they are one of the postural muscles that tend to be shortened a lot of times during the day if we at at a computer and we biceps are in a flexed position pretty much all the time if we our biceps are in a flexed position all the time we don stretched out so far to give our biceps an adequate stretch and therefore it it makes it even more important that we pay some attention to it how you stretch the biceps though is really important a lot of times guys will do this you them doing this and they their elbows straight and they pushing down they out the biceps there majorly wrong with this number one when you hold your hand on top here our bodies tend to do what comes naturally and that is we kind of fight the isometric Force we give back as much as we it mechanism for our joints so what we doing here is almost creating an own battle between our hand pushing down and our arm pushing up which means that the bicep is never really going to relax so that doesn this is our hand is supinated or our wrist is supinated here well we know that the bicep functions to superate the arm so if we want to stretch it we going to want to pronate it the third component is one that people Overlook all the time when it comes to biceps and that is the function of the fact that they do actually Flex the shoulder they bring the shoulder up in front of us so if we really want to stretch the biceps out especially the long head you want to get extension of the shoulder so to combine all these together this is what you behind you there something that you can grab on behind you first you pronate your hand down right because you want to take the bicep again I drew them myself to show you this you can see that just by suating here suating actually you know obviously activates the bicep itself okay so you can see it moving right there so if we pronate the hand in other words turn the forearm down we can put it on stretch the second thing we do is we get ourselves again with a straight elbow because we know that it flexes here the arm so we go down to a straight elbow straighten out as far as we can then with it pronated we go and we reach back behind our body here so that we have our arm now in extension and then the last thing we do is we step a little bit away so right now I kind of have it in line with the side of my body okay the last two things we do is we ex we tighten and contract the tricep by doing that now we reciprocal inhibition we of shutting off the bicep to allow for a bigger stretch so they contract the tricep and at the same time I step a little bit away this way so that now I that angle away from my body not just straight behind the reason why we do that is by taking that last little step away here now with the arm positioned out we uh to to be turned a little bit further away from us right now the groove kind of lines up right down in here and it pretty close to the front of our shoulder okay as we as the upper arm how the bicep the biceps Groove lines up when we turn turn it a little bit away you can see that these are the two points when I do that now I bit further away from each other Okay so we the triceps here then step away just a little bit and now I and man I can feel it my hands pronated down and I can feel that stretch on the bicep so there you go guys if you want to start stretching your biceps out this is the way to do it and if you never realize you should this is your cue to start doing it because as I said everything we do in a day is going to be done with our arms flexed even me here talking to you yes I have the tendency to keep my arms in this position it little bit more comfortable speaking position than doing this and standing here like a tin soldier but it will not help you in terms of getting your arms and your biceps stretched out which you want to let those muscles start developing fully the way they should I hope you guys found this video helpful if you like these stretching videos you want more of them then make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below and if you with me at the helm to kind of take you through as a physical therapist and not just tell you what to do but teach you why you more long lasting effects then make sure you head to aex.com and get our 90-day training system athletex I here guys in just a few days again four times a week I let me know you want to see and I will try to bring them to you uh each and every week see you soon	Success
Quick Shoulder Mobility Drill (STRONGER BENCH PRESS!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GG4Qi5whnA	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what want to show you today a quick shoulder Mobility drill that you can do a slightly different way than you probably already doing it to find out a lot more information about the stability of your shoulders so mobility and stability are always going to sort of interchangeably work together how much you have of each and how much they work together is very very important especially when we talking about the big lifs you see when some people do bench presses they shoulder pain as they press out or on their way down and it may not always be about the strength of the structures that are hurting you let tendon but maybe about the mobility or stability of the structures that are supporting that so this is a perfect example of how we can actually start to assess that if we do this normal drill which we probably do this instinctively when we want to get our shoulders to feel better we do shoulder circles we go either back to work on the external rotation here of our shoulders that way and we come forward or obviously we internal and external rotation it great way to feel loose and give us a good way to warm up our shoulders maybe before we hit the bench pressure and upper body movement but if we take a band and we corporate it with it we get a lot more information from the move so what we do is you take a band and now you hold it out at arms length okay and you put tension on the band by doing a bit of a band pull apart so you can see that my arms are out in front front of me They they actually trying to protract and get my seratus to have to fire and stabilize so now as my as my seratus are engaged here okay and the serus is going to help to keep our shoulder blade tight to our rib cage where we want it to be for more stability now we perform the over and back so what we do is we take the band and we move it up and I see what I apart as your arm are traveling back behind your body and the key here above all is to go slow because if I lack stability in my shoulder blades the one thing that you will happen to you is the band will snap down as soon as you get to a point where you can have the stabiliz stabilization through the muscles here in your shoulder blades you you want to go so slow and you go as you go all the way back that you control every single centimeter of the travel all the way back and at the bottom it doesn from your body and you reverse the Direction come back in front of you back to this original position okay so again from the front you arms are outstretched band hard exercise and again it working on those small stabilizers that we often Overlook and of course look at all the mobility I need in my shoulders to be able to do it again at the bottom I don slow it stays away from me and I to reverse the direction and come back to the front Okay so just like that try if you can get even I don of that without letting it hit you going to see where your weaknesses are if you have them and the idea here is is this a small movement yeah is it unimportant absolutely not you have to you can because they have big implications on the big things like I said bench pressing might be under undercut your bench pressing and how much you can bench press is being undercut by the stability of the muscles that wrap around and stabilize your whole body as you perform the bench press so if you want to lift big to get big that but you better be able to have the supporting muscles there to be able to allow you to lift big in the first place I hope you guys found this helpful again if you want a program where we don overlook little things cuz we realize how important they are head to aex.com right now and get our complete athletex training system if you found this video helpful let me know below try it out let me know how you do I know uh how many of you can go over and back 10 times really slow though really slow that band snap around and control you all right guys I see [Music] you	Success
How to REALLLLY Stretch Your Quads (Best Static Quad Stretch!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hKbghN2fUE	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com another aine Express video for you this time how to stretch the quads the right way so let little game here I two versions of the Quad stretch and you tell me which is the right way or which is the way that you do it most often all right first up here I am right here in standing doing a quad stretch we obviously got this as an option we obviously do this a lot a lot of people will do this is this the right version if you think so make a mental note of it second we laying down on my side again stretching my quad again pulling up on one leg and again a version that a lot of people will do if this is the version that you think is the best way to stretch your quads then let me know down below that this is what you do okay now let it all back you want to know what the right version is neither see there big problem when we stretch our quads out is that we substitution pattern right here through the lumbar spine that winds up compromising the stretch on the quad so if you really want to get an effective quad stretch you have to learn how you can take lumbar extension out of the stretch when we you in the beginning we basically are getting a uh fle an extension of the lumbar spine so as I like this leg is getting back behind me more all I back again through my lumbar spine to feel as if I between the quad and hip flexor and my upper trunk so we don we want to get rid of it the first thing we have to do is get on the ground and then secondly when we got to change our leg position so when we having our leg our lower leg out straight what we need to do is get our lower leg in at 90° okay so our lower leg gets at 90° by lifting the the knee up towards our chest and then our leg here on top will now get a true quad stretch what interesting if you want to test this out yourself is take your lower leg straighten it out and then pull back on the knee immediately I 20° or 10 at least 10 to 20° of motion with my leg getting behind my body but nothing changed in my quad flexibility I just substituted in lumbar extension through my back I was able to lean myself back but if I pull my knee up in the front it flattens out the lumbar spine takes out the curve so now I stuck with whatever I which is obviously much less because now the knee is actually in front of my body I can even get it back to uh parallel to my trunk here so again guys when you taking your stretching and you to incorporate the right stretches you got to make sure you right way and it goes beyond that with all of our training I always say guys if you want to look like an athlete you got to train like an an athlete I want to say you know add to that you better stretch like an athlete too you better eat like an athlete it all matters athletes have to have everything matter because what they do for a living is how they get paid and how they get how they perform and how they make their their uh their living you got to start caring guys like they care about what you do I try to help you as your coach with our Athletics training system you can get that over at athletex decom right now if you haven start doing everything the right way not just your stretching but you and your eating as as well all right guys if you found this helpful make sure you leave a thumbs up below and comment whatever else you need help with and I it I couple days	Success
Shoulder Mobility Drill FIX CRACKING SHOULDERS!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAvOnpN7Shc	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what lot of times athletes will come to me and say Jeff whenever I do a pressing movement either a bench press or an overhead press I get a lot of crunching and grinding in my shoulder and it either painful or just bothersome is there anything I can do about it and unfortunately a lot of times it rest of our training that leads us to the point where we are feeling the symptoms of the results of our bad training so so if we situation though there something we can try to do to get around that and hopefully even long term address that so maybe we can help to get rid of some of that Crunch and grinding that going to do that we can do some drills here that through a single workout but if you do them long term a little bit more consistently get through a lot more than that actually start to help correct the problem and we could do that here by getting into position to do what we would call immobilization now you have to understand there between mobility and mobilization for me as a PT mobilization means actually trying to mobilize a joint to restore normal joint mechanics to whatever joint we be a catchall phrase that includes things to stretch muscles and things to decrease pain and things to of course work on our joints as well but you can use the word mobilization for every single thing we do because it really what we improving Mobility by using mobilizations would mean that we going to attack the joints and that what we yourself in position as if you bench press you attach just a red band here to an anchor point this is one of our athl extreme bands now you put it above your bicep and what we to recreate here is the key point to this entire concept of mobilizations again somewhere where I think a lot of guys get off track when they about Mobility if you mobilize a joint and restore the normal mechanics of that joint you want to try to do that out of what we call the open pack position of that particular joint and here we humeral joint the ball and socket in our shoulder because that feeling the grinding if you do this the open pack position is one in which the arm is held about 60° away from the side of your body so if this is zero 60° away from the side of your body into abduction and then up about 30° off the ground okay so what this does is it position where the joint is it loosest at its most vulnerable to what we thing because if we guarding or holding too tight there way we all on this joint so in this position this open pack or loose pack position we have the least amount of ligament tension we have the least amount of capsular tension and we actually do something in this joint that might have a long-standing effect so that that resting position again you anchor above your bicep you get yourself again about 60° out 30° up and then from here I I might slide a little bit out of frame by slide my body against the tension of the band so now I pull in this direction okay out this way I Glen humeral joint so I actually feel like I loosening in here it actually feels good without me even doing anything yet so now I got the tension now I just reach across again up over the bicep I reach across I grab just above the wrist nice and loose okay it doesn I going on here in my arm okay this is the the the humorous up here this is the part of the ball soet that we on and I just pull a little bit here and I roll a little bit away so what I doing is both with my hand and with my body I direction and the band is pulling me back in that direction again I reestablish this resting position here again out to the side and off the ground in that right position and I just hold it here and I can kind of pull a little bit more and roll a little bit more in this direction and I get a really nice distraction going on in through my shoulder again feeling like I some good separation creating a little bit of space now after I position I go grab my dumbbells or my barbell and I get in this position here and I press and I feel even from just not doing this side I feel a huge difference it feels nice and loose I actually created a little bit more space in here and I feel like I can actually press without getting all that crunching in my shoulder here want to make this a long-standing fix you better work on that three four times a week okay multiple times because doing it just now might get me through my workout but if you focusing on doing it multiple times you long-standing changes and especially if you positions of these joints whichever joint you to be able to get the job done effectively of course avoiding some of those crappy exercises that maybe put you in this position in the first place is key as well guys if you want to start training like an athlete in getting around the exercises that maybe aren the best for your body but still optimizing your strength and your performance I invite you to head to aex.com and let me coach you through our athex training systems again as a physical therapist I think it the biggest advantages I bring to the programs that we create are the ability to bring the science back into what we do you can get those at aex.com in the meantime if you found this video helpful and you like the idea behind including some of these uh mobilization drills into what we do just let me know below and I all right guys be back here again soon	Success
How to Stretch Your Lats (BEST STRETCH EVER!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V5tSn9oEJg	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what today I stretching out your lats I broke out the marker again to make sure you can understand because this is an important one you know this is a muscle that a lot of times doesn that the muscles on the front of our body do because we can worse off it never gets stretched as much as it should be and that is probably causing a lot of problems for you especially if you see throwing athletes rely on being able to get into a proper overhead position but if your lats are tight as I to show you it can really impair your ability to do that not only that just our casual lifters who don their lats enough anytime you try to get up and overhead for any type of overhead lifting move if your lats aren adequately loose you compensations and problems that you going to get in your shoulder joint that can sort of render the rest of your upper body workouts useless so now what is the lat how are we going to stretch it out that look on the other side first you can see kind of the overall structure of the lat it gets his name from latissimus means broad so it comes up here attaches onto our upper arm bone our humoris okay and it crosses down and it has attachments all the way through into the back here along our uh our spine and on most people not everybody which I think is pretty interesting it will insert right down here into the pelvis too so it comes all the way down and inserts into the pelvis so we can see that it lot of stuff it pelvis to your arm so if we want to stretch it adequately then we got to figure out what its functions are so we can do the exact opposite of that and make sure that we right way that I think it helps you guys to visualize as we take it through step by step so one of the most common ways you people try to stretch their lap is they this height and they I they out and my I stretching it yeah I definitely am but you have to remember if it attaching all the way down in here we can make that a better stretch by getting our arm way up over our head you see when you type of stretch you take those two points of attachment as far away from each other as you possibly can so if I can get my arm up in a way and then drop down now I can get a bigger stretch because you can see that the point is now here to all the way down in here versus here and all the way down in here so we length just by doing that you should be able to see that on the blue lines but that the next thing is remember I said it attaches down here to your hips well if your hips stay in line right here and I don not getting the maximum stretch we could so the next phase is I want to take my arm get it high and then drop my hips back as far as I can so I hips all the way back as far as I can to get more and more and more stretch way down here in these lower fibers of the lats okay so that gets a little bit more interesting because we know that it attach to our vertebrae on one side kind of feeding into the back so what we want to do next is when we wanted to get my vertebrae further away from this point what would I do I would rotate away from it so now when I if I rotate my hips to the left you see this is staying fixed because I holding on but my spine is going the other way my spine is heading that way my arm is staying this way so now by rotating now I of a stretch so my hips are back my arm is up I there we got one more Dimension here that we need to stretch and that would be a side Bend because again if it attaching to this portion of my back right here in my spine if I were to side side Bend like that now I more of a stretch of those muscles okay so side bending over so now we here again we back we twist away and then I take my hips and I shoot them that way towards you guys in this direction now as I rotate and I come up that my friends that out	Success
Hip Mobility Drill (FIX SNAPPING HIPS INSTANTLY!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngf3qdxZAjk	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what couple weeks back I showed you a drill that you could do for your shoulder to eliminate the popping and the grinding Sensation that you every time you raise it over your head it was a short-term fix and we did it with an active muscle solution basically reprogramming the muscles of the shoulder to reposition the shoulder back where it needs to be to help you to eliminate all those Sensations now we can do the same thing with our hip and we do it in a more passive way we could do it here with a band in a hip mobility drill I I say mobility and I say it very much uh in a reserved way because I get very annoyed by people throwing around Mobility drills like their candy they not they should be used in a very specific way and they really should be understood if you as a physical therapist I do feel like I understand them it living what you need to do is you need to respect what we call the open pack position of a joint and what that means is you loose position so that the capsu structures around it are loose and allow you to actually mobilize it if you perform a joint mobilization out of a closed pack position you would basically be trying to pull a joint or mobilize a joint within itself that the way tightened up and taught and has no room or play to move that to get you anywhere you be wasting your time so for the hip what you want to do is you want to get in the open pack position so what we do is we put the band up as high as we can into our groin and we get to the side of the the resistance here okay so we to create a lateral distraction remember when we look at the hip as it sits in the ball and socket it pulled straight down that wouldn us a distraction we bottom part of the acetabulum here what we want to do is we want to laterally Glide it away that gives us room and then we can manipulate it and create some space of the capsule so if we get in here on the side the next thing we want to do is we want to drop ourselves out and back so you want to get about 30° out from the midline and 30° into flexion so you come this way first so 30° off of the midline this is the middle we want to come a little bit out that way so my knee is in this direction and we going to get 30° of flexion so we way until we the hip this would be zero right here up into about 30 now we step out to the side okay now we got a nice distraction going on here as long as I don allow it to pull me all the way over I keep my muscles engaged on the other side and we just have this nice distraction going on here now why do we want to do this well first of all just let it kind of ease you into a little bit more capsu mobility of your hip but more importantly why do we need more hip mobility because when we try to squat we feel pinching or we try to squat we feel popping any type of sensation discomfort in the hip maybe your Mobility down into a squat you can times it in the capsule of the hip or as I said if you have an impingement inside the hip that could be causing a little bit of pinching or pain this will help both of those things so we get in this position now as we the Glide remember you got to get far enough out you actually get the distraction going on from here now you allow yourself to sit back sit back sit back sit back now getting into this deep flexion here of the hips with the distraction of the band that actually feels really good I come back up if I can go a little bit further out I try to get a little bit further out okay down in here off to the side a little bit and I sit back and I sit back all the way down and I come back up now what you want to do is when you get down to the part where you feel the Restriction after you do about 10 of those reps when you get down to the point of restriction just try to kind of ease your way and bounce into it a little bit you know just a little bit of a you know a little bit of a balance at the very bottom here trying to work your way through the bottom 2 or 3 Ines the part where you feel restricted after you this bring yourself out come out and then retest your flexion if you squatting you tell that you can get much deeper into your squat because your hip should be much Freer now again it long-term fix the long-term fix is to try to do this in conjunction with strengthening the muscles around the hip to reposition the hip and hold it where it needs to be uh forever but for the short term you could do this and go Squat and you should feel again an instantaneous relief of an impingement or an instantaneous increase in the range of motion that you have down at your hip I hope you guys found this video helpful it is about putting the science back in strength because I don see any other way to do it and as I said in the beginning Mobility drill is just prescribed with every single thing to do everywhere and in any case in any instance doesn has to be a specific instance and you have to to do it in a specific way if you want to do it without wasting your time if you found this helpful guys make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up Below in the meantime if you looking for a program that puts the science back into everything we do not just our Mobility not just the way we treat our hip but every single workout every single exercise we choose then head to athlet next.com and get our athletex training program and uh I back here again in just a few days you leave your requests of what you like to see and I see

Thoracic Mobility Drill Gone Bad (OOPS!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-GDuhjOAU8	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what you movement or have any exercise done with your arms fully overhead you need shoulder Mobility yes but it going to be enough alone you need to have thoracic Mobility you need more specifically the ability to extend through your thoracic spine as a matter of fact even a healthy shoulder is only going to give you 165° of flexion here in front of your body body in order to get all the way up to 180 you to need to have 15° of thoracic extension so it doesn but a lot of us have lost it because we have this rounded forward posture the shoulders forward posture from all the things we do during the day all the time spent at the computer driving whatever we do that motion we need we need to go backwards so we can do that with a foam roller here but you got to make sure you avoiding some of the big mistakes that I see people make all the time when they they but they do it like this they roll they lay over the top of the foam roller they put their arms here behind their head to support their neck which is not a bad thing especially if you have a weak neck but what you pretty much blocked off exposure and access to your thoracic spine because when I do this I shoulder blades so now my shoulder blades are actually sitting a little bit lower than my thoracic spine and I even getting to it I to the point where I can mobilize the spine so what we want to do is actually do the opposite you want to be able to get your arms out in front of you protract your shoulder blades get them away out and away so that the lowest point is now the thoracic spine so I can actually get at it and work at it some people can even cross their arms ien even had success sometimes with people who can from a pull-up bar and having them grab the band so I know that it pulling their arms up and into extension so now that we spine the next mistake that you want to avoid is just roll rolling back and forth over it like this because what this tends to do is first of all create contraction from your abs as soon as I Contracting here from my abs I kind of stabilized my spine and I it to actually bend over into extension so what you want to do is drop your hips down get the ABS out of it just try to work on that area of the spine that tight so once I find it I got my arms up in front of me and I get myself right on that tight spot I just try to allow myself to sink back okay right on that spot I can work it with a little bit of a roll back and forth right in that tight spot and I should be able to feel it now what you can do is once you found that tight spot and you up over here now once you it for about a minute or so you can then start to allow your arms to go back back back back back into the position that they will be into overhead extension right so we into that 180 and if I had a bar over my head I point so that work yourself in okay there thing we can do here to mobilize a thoracic spine we don roller so what we can do is come over to a bench and I like this one because it actually gives us two benefits it gives us a chance to mobilize that thoracic spine but also stretch out your lats because one of the biggest problems we have is tight lats tight lats will prevent our arms from going up and over our head so you put your arm arms up on a bench like this bend your elbows then sink back into your hips this way and try to drop your head and your in your thoracic spine really your chest down towards the ground so if my chest heads down towards the ground I this action so I here through the middle of my back so here and I go straight down then if I want to again reestablish I come up I round it up so I can feel like okay I the opposite direction of this now if I want to go in the opposite direction of this go into this position first now I know okay opposite is straight down and I drive my chest towards the ground I can really feel this then up through here get that Excursion and then go straight back the opposite direction I can feel it in my lats I can feel it here in my thoracic spine so you got two options there whether again whether you have a foam roller if you do just make sure you do it right because there you preventing you from even getting any real benefit from it in the first place and secondly if you don on a bench do it on a piece of furniture but just work and be aware of the area you area and you 15° but it difference in helping you to get your arm fully up overhead so you can protect your shoulders and make sure you doing those exercises correctly guys as a physical therapist this stuff matters to me cuz the guys that come into me all screwed up usually have this stuff screwed up I can help you to get more out of everything you do by helping you to train a little bit smarter by putting the science back in strength I do that in our athex training system you can get it over at aex.com if you found this video helpful make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below and let me know what else you want me to cover here especially in these PT related videos and I that in the days ahead all right I back

Joint Mobility IS NOT Good for Everything (MOBILIZATION OVERDOSE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lnCP4z_dGk	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what athleanx.com so I of my horrendous drawing here the idea though is this drawing by the end of this video will become incredibly helpful for you not only in understanding more about how your body works but more importantly how you need to fix it or start thinking about how to fix it if it ever breaks down and if you you leading to more breakdowns than it might be to building you actually up and that sort of the trend that we training these days and breakdown is happening all over the place so what I want you to see is I of joints on the board here and I basically started at the foot and I work my way up the major joints and there going to be a pattern that you to see that the relationship of one joint to the next I second but the first thing you should really kind of find cool is that when we originally in the body before we become developed adults and before we become babies we upon itself when that cell start to split and open up it up a mirror image top and bottom right lower body upper body of itself so that you see joints that function very much the same your ankle is really kind of a reflection of your wrist it the lower body version of your wrist and therefore your calves are kind of like your forearms they kind of do the same thing and then down here you quads and your in your legs right your legs are just like your arms so the quads will extend the legs extend the knee the triceps will extend the elbow here so there going on uh top to bottom which makes it really uh easy to understand this next point that we have mobile and stable joints okay a joint is usually except for two big cases that are already outlined here I out usually has a role of either being mobile or stable when I mean by mobile is it give you motion you really want those joints to provide as much motion as they can to help you to move properly the stable joints aren necessarily bind down and prevent motion Al together their main role is to be able to control Mobility or to control the motion at that joint in the face of of Mobility from other joints around it so here look down here and you start the toes you ask yourself whether it or a stable joint and the main thing is that the toes need to be mobile those things need to be able to move and when they don here how it actually winds up compromising a lot of other uh areas and creating injury but that the the midfoot is the area right sort of it yeah um can the midfoot is that area sort of right in through here that reflection of the hand right right that needs to be more stable that area of the foot is a stable area because it needs to be able to as I defined it just a second ago kind of control the the emotion at that joint when you when you it needs to provide some stability your ankle though that needs to be mobile so your mobile ankle needs to provide you with enough motion if it doesn break down especially things when you squat people who lack ankle Mobility wind up having problems the knee is a pretty stable joint there the knee it not a lot of motion there it should be a pretty stable joint the hip on the other hand yes it and socket joint but it joint remember I said in the very beginning here how I point out the two areas that sort of need to be mobile and stable they kind of have a dual rle well it it ball and socket and the shoulder ball and socket but for the most part it mobile joint then you get back into the lumbar spine you want stability lumbar spine if you don that breakdown and I these in a second just get the idea here of we have stability here sorry mobile stable thoracic spine mobile got to be able to move here most people can in their thoracic spine that causes a lot of problems scapula thoracic joint they be able to ability to keep your scapula in place on your rib cage As you move your arm up that needs to be mobile I we know that stable joint here are really hard to find because people have all kinds of things going on with their scapula they got winging scapula they have tilted scapula they have all kinds of problems there back up to the up here again we want mobile because we got that ball on socket joint again but we also want to be stable for reasons I into the elbow like the knee we want that to be stable then we wrist we want the wrist like the ankle to be mobile and then you got the mid carple you want that to be stable and then you want your fingers to be mobile right you can figure this out pretty much yourself but look what happens when you look at the pattern here obviously mobile stable mobile stable mobile and stable stable mobile stable mobile and stable stable mobile stable mobile it an alternating pattern of all these and there order to have a stable joint it have that motion the mobility around it and the same thing in order to control the motion from those Mobility the the joints that are supposed to be mobile you need to have a stable joint somewhere to be able to reain it all together well when we look at what goes wrong we can talk about like I said in the beginning even at the toes if you lack mobility in your toes you might get a compromised midfoot an injury to the midfoot a lot of football players that I train will undergo uh will suffer an injury called the list fron brain and that midfoot and it midfoot was trying to be stable and when the midfoot had to contribute or sacrifice some of its stability to the toes that were supposed to be mobile but aren joint becomes less stable and it breaks down and it causes injury right if that toes aren really actually a serious problem your toes especially your big toe better be damn mobile and the problem with a lot of football players is they get really arthritic in their toes and they lack motion there well if it doesn motion from there guess what it to find it somewhere else and it to grab it from the next joint up and when it does and it reaches for that mobility and a joint that be stable that and maybe you can because you never sprained your midfoot before and you don that of you watching have had a knee injury that be a stable joint okay but it can be influenced as I said by those mubble joints above and below it what if you don you don when you you can mobility in your ankle guess what happens the knee says well I give it to you if I can I you I put all that pressure on the front of your kneecap and the patellar tendon you get a lot of problems in your knee but guess what it the first place it ankle didn the dorsal flexion to be able to allow you to go down and allow that knee to stay where what where it be instead it starts to travel forward more so you your knee is not to blame what blame is the fact that you have no mobility in a mob in in a joint that supposed to be mobile and the same thing can be said here for the hip and the same thing here when you have a lumbar spine breakdown a problem with lumbar spine normally it the hell out if it says hey well the hip isn out so you get all this motion going on through the lumbar spine all this this motion that the lumbar spine is not supposed to move that much but because it knows that it needs to get to where you need to do where it needs to be to be able to perform whatever lower body move you doing it its own stability becoming mobile that a problem it starts to break down when really what you should have done was make sure that you had the mobility in the hip to begin with so the answer is not to run out and mobilize everything that hear mobilization Mobility drills it kind of these buzzword they think it the greatest thing in the world it the greatest thing in the world sometimes you got to work on stability and not Mobility the direct opposite of what people will tell you to do I I did point out the last thing here is that some joints these two in particular your shoulder and your hip need to be able to benefit from both mobility and stability okay I talked about a few of the instances already where Mobility a lack of Mobility will cause those other areas that were supposed to be stable to give in some of their stability to help out but it also needs to be stable too I seen so many people athletes especially but really just Gym Rats who lack stability in their shoulders yeah they lack Mobility too we know that people can internal external rotation the way they should but then even when they get the mobility there you go and you start doing a bench press you can your shoulder blades you can your shoulder itself and what happens is it starts moving all around as you trying to bench and you are asking for a problem the other day I did a video on dips and how it stability in through your shoulders as you do that exercise not just to protect your chest but to actually get more out of it if you haven got to watch it right here I I I a link to it this is the video about how to actually do dips by maximizing stability of your shoulders and I telling you way more effort being done by the pecs and therefore growth in in value out of the exercise by doing it so this is a whole big ass mess of my bad drawing but the idea is simple is that you have to start thinking understand how your body actually set up and how it works understand that not everything is meant to be mobilized understand that when something does go wrong you don to look necessarily right at the source of that problem but you want to start looking above and below and figuring out where it is that you because once you know that then there a lot of things you can do to try to fix that long term as a physical therapist that least got to get you to start feeling like you can diagnose your own injuries and and issues so you at least have a better idea of how to start honing in on what found this helpful if you did leave your comments uh about it and your thumbs up Below in the meantime if you for a training program that like that puts the science back in strength I know this could be a little bit overwhelming but it to just give you the idea that we know what we sort of pride myself on not being the average YouTube guy okay I could I don need to be a YouTube guy I want to be here to be an educator and be a a resource for you guys that want to take training seriously we got our training program over at athletex decom that puts training puts the science back in strength and takes training seriously you can get your hands on that by going to athl next.com in the meantime again like I said if there want me to talk about and sort of add the PT angle to it let me know and I glad to do that here for you guys uh to the best of my ability all right I talk to you guys again real

RIGHT Stretching Routine - WRONG TIME!! (Big Mistake)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLAerhu77ws	ATHLEAN - X	Does stretching have you confused? Today, I the right type of stretching and when to do it, but how you can take the same routine, one piece of equipment, and change it two ways to accomplish all your stretching goals. What ax.com. I said it in the open. Stretching. It real confusing topic for guys, for anybody working out. They are a little bit confused about the type of stretching and more importantly when to do it. So, I thought in this video, let me put together a lower body stretching routine that accomplishes the explaining part of when to do it, tells you the quick differences between them, and then shows you the routine and how you could just switch it up just a little bit to accomplish the goal that you to go for. So to start off, we want to talk about static stretching and dynamic stretching. Now static stretching is the type of stretching where we actually hold a stretch. I don stretching. If you tricep, it you stretch in a hold, right? Not a lot of action going on there. That of stretching that you to do after a workout and do it preferably at night before you go to bed. Why is that? because that we want to actually try to interfere with our cross bridging of our muscle fibers. You know, basically what type of cross-linking are we getting? We want to try to actually cause expansion in the muscles themselves. Create a length increase. So, if you were to do that prior to working out, which is what I always say not to do, you can actually interfere with the length tension relationship inside of a muscle fiber. not what you want to do just right when you because your mind is not sort of feeling the muscles the way it them in that stored pattern of movement. So we want to not interfere with that. We want to be able to kind of rely on the fact that our muscles and mind are working together. So you don interfere with it with static stretching. What you do want to do though is dynamic stretching. It could be the same movement pattern but done where you continue to move. you work on the eccentric lengthening of the muscle but also get it back to its normal length so that you a warm-up taking it through a range more than you are actually going to try to increase the length. So that difference and when you want to do them dynamic before a workout static after a workout preferably before you go to bed because overnight is when you to heal shorter and those muscle fibers are going to heal. So if you can get a little bit of extra length before you go to bed perfect situation for the muscles that you work that day. So, here routine for the lower body. One piece of equipment, the Athleen elastics uh red band, the extreme band, and I lied. Two pieces of equipment, a pull-up bar, something to hang it on. We get this band up top and then we pull down and put our foot in the band. Now, first move we get tight on guys mostly. A lot of times, guys can up to their chest. So, what the band does is it gives us that added assistance to get up here. You can put a little extra stretch right here around the knee. Hold on if you have to or just hold up here. This is just passively taking me up. All right. Again, static holds. 30 seconds to 60 seconds. This is my nighttime routine. Next hamstring. Let the leg go out as straight as I can. Again, this band wants to pull me up. Big key here is when I stretch, keep uh an arch in your low back, right? Take out the slack in the hamstrings with your pelvis anteriorly tilted here and then let it come up. You shouldn have to come down and lean. It should be enough of tension already just by keeping your pelvis in position to feel the hamstring right off the bat. Okay. Want to turn around to the adductors inside the groin. All you got to do is just change position of your body. Rotate yourself out. Now we stretch in here. Okay. You can sink down into it a little bit more. Can by leaning in this direction. Okay. I also feel it on this leg too. Then we come around to the front side here. Let it bend my quad up, my knee. So I down into it to get the hip flexor at the same time. So quad and hip flexor. Again, all these are holds. And then finally come back around. Guys extremely tight in their hips and rotation. Take it, turn your foot, point it that way. It literally pulls yourself all the way up into this position here. Again, position most guys can in. If you want to test how how uncomfortable it is, get into a chair, sit down, cross your foot over your other knee, and see if you can get your knee this knee flat. Most guys will find that their knee is pointing way up to the to the sky. Thumb that up right now if you try that and you see because most likely you are going to see that your hip won here to do this. All right. So now, how do we turn this into a preworkout, pre-lorbody workout routine, something that we could stretch out, just make it dynamic. So push down, let it come up. Push down, let it come up. Down, let it come up. Okay. So, we this range of motion. Each time if I loosening myself up, working on the mobility of the hip and the structures inside the hip joint and also the muscles back here, I should notice that my leg will go higher and higher. Get it out here. Push down. Let it eentrically come up. Push down. Let it eentrically come up. Okay. Same thing. Down. Eccentrically come up. Same thing here. Down. act like a leg swing. We used to do these a lot in Major League Baseball. Down, kick out to the side, and then let it come across your body. And then up. I like to kind of lean towards that leg as I do it. Down and then up. Down and then up. Okay. Same thing here. Out to the side. Pull it down. Ease the tension. Let it pop up. Down. Ease the tension. Let it pop up again. Good to be able to control this. Don let it snap up. You know, besides losing your leg, you might lose something else in between. Guys, you want to make sure you come down eccentrically control it. Why? Because you want to have the reactive ability to eccentrically control when you activity or work out or run or play a sport. So, it event. And then finally in here, as I said, get it on the end. Again, try to straighten your quad out and then let it take it up. Straighten your quad out. Again, not just straighten the knee, but bring your leg forward and then let it take it both back down and then take it both back. All right. So again, one piece of equipment, one routine. change the way you benefit that you see. This is the kind of stuff, guys, that we cover with Athlete X. It to the gym and going and doing a workout and thinking you same results that somebody else is going to get. You got to approach everything with the right sequencing. The wrong the right thing done at the wrong time is no better than the wrong thing. Period. So, get everything in right. Head over to athletex.com. Grab the Athletex training program. Start training like an athlete. Athletes know when to do this stuff. So should you. And I you grab our program. Be back here again just a few days with another workout. If this routine helped you and you like it, try it out and add it to your program. If you don band, you can grab them over at athleenex.com or go straight to it, athleenalastex.com. I back here in a couple days. Heat. Heat.	Success
Front Squats Mobility Problems (FIXED!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1yZ4etUPM	ATHLEAN - X	what x.com here you today on wrist straps and not for what you think they might be used for I actually don straps for our grip assistance I feel like you the intrinsic hand strength your grip strength your forearm strength when you improve that over time the more you take on that challenge but if we do an exercise like the front squat we run into separate issues and that I like to actually use these four with the front squat we sometimes have wrist mobility issues that prevent us from getting in the proper position elbows up elbows High well we can utilize wrist straps to overcome that I show you exactly how you do that now first of all if you have risk mobility issues it doesn screwed and that you can I actually did a video showing you a risk mobilization technique that I will link right for you here watch it if you have tight wrist and can into extension because that might be the first thing and the only thing you have to do but if for some reason guys do have limited structurally limited wrist extension they to do this exercise right so something like this wrist WP would actually help so here your wrist WPS you wrap it around the bar like this I close up so you take the wrist STP you wrap it around and secure it to the bar okay we did the same thing on the other other side over here and now when we get in position for the squat we going to grab the handles wrap them around once and then get up on the other side of the bar so here and up on the other side of the bar you want to make sure that your elbows are up at least parallel to the ground so from there now when we do our front squat up in this position you actually have a neutral grip number one you don have all this exaggerated extension that actually execute the squat that you couldn before okay now one more tip for you I also got a pair hanging up here on the pullup bar what sometimes we can overcome equipment limitations even if we use wrist straps we take them we hang them from the pull-up bar we wrap them once instead of being forced to do either an overhand pullup or an underhand chin up we can now do a neutral grip version of it so we wrap it once wrap once come in here and pull up and we got a nice neutral grip and it helps us to work on our grip strength there too so not always what it appears to be guys some of these things that we utilize in the gym can be used for other purposes really for me the goal is to make them functional to allow you guys to do the things I feel like you need to be doing and get there the most efficient and Safe Way and guys that haven 90-day training program let me help you get from day one to day 90 utilizing all the tips I shape of your life if you haven already guys aex.com grab 90-day training program start training like an athlete start using your surroundings in ways you never thought you would and get the best body of your life all right guys if you found this helpful make sure you leave a comment and a thumbs up below and let me know what else it is You to bring those videos to you I read your comments I look at what you want and I make sure I bring those to you all right guys we be back here again in just a couple days	Success
Abs and Oblique Stretch (TIGHT ABS FIX!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-RW-8lqtnw	ATHLEAN - X	what next.com so having tight abs is probably high up on your list of priorities if you Wednesday but having tight abdominal muscles that is an entirely different story matter of fact that can create a lot of dysfunction in your other lifts and workouts you see the muscles in your core particularly the internal and external obliques and your rectus abdominis the six-pack muscle that is actually causing a problem for a lot of your other lifts if they are allowed to become short and tight and they become short and tight pretty easily because of two things number one we hardly ever stretch our ABS I to try to correct that for you here today by showing you three ways you can and secondly we sit a lot either we driving in a car on our commute to work or while we even at night we allows these muscle to become a little bit tight and we have to realize that when we look at these muscles they doing really the same thing they all have attachments origins or attachments in our rib cage and then down here in our pelvis so they take those two points when they they bring them closer together so what happens when we bring your rib cage closer to your pelvis you look like that so a lot of postural issues can come out of that actually we can lead to other things that we think might be problems that maybe aren we say oh they got no lack of thoracic extension they can thoracic spine no maybe they can extend their thoracic spine because they can their pelvis cuz they have tight abs so here addressing this I take out a fysio ball like I the top of it and a lot of you might again do this instinctively because you figure it feels good or it stretches you out a little bit but the big thing that you have to make sure you is you the pelvis so I do that by getting into the position where I first lay over the back of the ball I get that rib cage expanded I get my arms up over my head and then the key is dropping the hips dropping the pelvis further away from the rib cage so we can get that maximum stretch on the rectus abdominis and I can intensify that by just adding a nice deep breath in I see it or not while I nice deep breath in to expand the rib cage even more and again increase that stretch being felt on the rectus now what I could do is again we got to deal with the internal external obliques too because those are big muscle groups that are impacting our posture in different ways are a little bit uh slanted compared to the up and down orientation of the rectus abdominis but we can get at them too and we could get at them by just turning ourselves over and getting on the side of the ball now we get on the side of the ball the same thing happens here rib cage and pelvis separate them drop them as far away from each other as you possibly can now when you twist a little bit and lean back you can get the external obliques to be a little bit favorably stretched because you taking them away further away from the angle that they run into the uh to to the rib cage you cage further away from the pelvis where the external obliques uh attach okay and then the same thing can happen here when we go to the internal obliques you just want to roll yourself down a little bit still maintain that side Bend because the real attachment here is the iliac crest right on the side of our hips get that a little further away and again rotate downward and get away from the uh in other words elongate that internal oblique a little bit more now you don have to do this all the often cuz I bet you you at all even at the moment do a little bit more of it and I promise you you going to see benefits as it over laps into the rest of your training I mentioned in the beginning some of the dysfunction that you could see in some of your lifts by allowing yourself to get tight abs the squat is probably the best example of this if you try to squat out of the posterior tilt you immediately putting your low back in Jeopardy of injury cuz you a very compromised position that very stable position at all you want an anterior tilt out of here here so that as you lean forward right to create the right angle of the bar through your the mid the middle of your feet you to need to have a low back that slightly arched to support your spine and and keep it in a strong position you have an anterior tilt or the ability to anterior tilt and drop that pelvis down and away from your roof cage that something that we just covered is not that possible if you allow your abs to get that tight so you want to make sure that you when it comes to stretching because stretching is important for all your muscles your abs are no less important especially as we realize the implications it has for not doing them I hope you found this as a maybe an eye opener and you of the quick stretches that I showed you and if you get a little bit on that nerdy side here uh the PT side to explain these things but I think from the feedback I get from you these are the things that help you to understand why it is what you doing and I think if you understand what you from doing them and that basis of our athletex training programs is to allow you guys to understand what it is you better results from them from all of your workouts from all of your training from everything you do in and outside the gym if you training programs guys they aex.com in the meantime if you found this helpful make sure you leave your comments a thumbs up below watch for Wednesdays once a week we

How to Stretch BEFORE Working Out (QUADS and LEGS)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8Qkec1gKF0	ATHLEAN - X	Not since Kim and Kanye has one single picture been talked about more in a oneweek period than this one right here. Guys, I what importantly why you need to know what going [Music] on. What ax.com. Welcome to Poster Gate right here. This one picture probably uh worth more money this week than a picture of Kim and Kanye of the controversy that it sparked in just a short week since the last time I did a video on static stretching and static stretching of the quads and then basically people say, are you doing here in this picture? Good point. That good question, guys. It between static and dynamic stretching. Now, I videos on the topic, and we have a series of ones that I want you to watch. And I to be worth your while to watch them all. So, when I link one of these videos, see if you can watch each part of it, cuz it will really explain what we there static stretch of a muscle and a dynamic stretch. For those that are kind of new to this, a static stretch is when you going to hold the stretch with the with the effect of trying to increase the length of that muscle over time. Static stretching, guys, because of that, you before you go to bed when most muscle shortening and healing occurs because you want to have an impact on that muscle shortening before it can actually set in. And you want to be able to do that each and every night because static stretching is most beneficial when it done recurrently. So, here we about that. We dynamic stretch. When you ready to play a sport or if you even a competitive athlete, guys, when you weight room, you got to start focusing on dynamic stretching of whatever the areas that you that session are. If it pretty much better be flexible upper and lower body because you doing a lot of running, a lot of hitting if it room and you you can sort of favorably choose one half or the other, but you should be dynamically warming it up. With dynamic exercises, guys, it Dynamic means movement. You want to be moving into and out of your stretches quickly and not statically or prolongingly holding on to any stretch that you do. right here. What Damon Easley is doing, and this is a this is our all-star second baseman who basically was recovering from a pretty severe ankle sprain in 2007 to come back in 2008. He and I want to show that to you again. We have we covered a video about the importance of dynamic stretching in leg swings for the down leg and not just the up leg. So, watch what what we here and I Basically, I don hold on to, so I the stick is me. Basically, I on to it. What you you get a dynamic hamstring stretch by kicking your leg forward and then you grab onto the uh the quad here for a second. Forward. Grab and stretch for a second. Forward. Grab and stretch for a second. Forward. So, you get this dynamic, never holding in any one position pattern of movement. You move into your, which are not shown here, both hands onto my shoulders at this point. You the body leg swings, okay? Back and forth. And you up the hips and closes down the hips. Again, an entire video I made on that, you can watch it right here. Make sure you do if you haven a very helpful video, I think, when you when it comes to dynamic stretching of the lower body. But what important is it that down leg. And that that video. how that ankle that has to handle all those forward and backward movements in a quick you know quick uh pattern that has to has an effect of mobilizing that down ankle. So again everything is about mobilizing and sort of getting this this entire lower body ready to play. So what about the substitution patterns that I talked about that we wanted to avoid in static stretching? If you change of a muscle and you in a static way, great. That what you should be doing. And you don want to have substitutions. If you trying to target the quad, then target the quad and remove the compensations that we make there. You to get on the ground. If you haven seen that video, guys, by the way, anyway, it you haven it. I on the ground to do our quad stretch because we can pull our other leg up and eliminate that tendency for our lumbar spine to contribute and substitute. Guess what step under a squat bar with 300 lb on the bar or Damian steps up to the plate to get ready to hit a 95 mph fast ball. Guess what his body needs to make sure that he can rotate and get through the ball so he can try to get a hit or if you need to execute that one last rep. You to compensate. you absolutely compensate. In order to make sure that you your dynamic stretching does not have to worry so much about compensations. As a matter of fact, for it to be mostly effective, it compensations that you over time. Remember, it statically increasing the length. It about mobilizing and getting your body ready to prepare uh prepared and ready to play or perform in the gym. realizing that those compensations are there and you have to make sure that you to handle them. So again, dynamically, make sure that whatever it is that you same thing. You maybe you have some compensation up here because of a bad shoulder and you necessarily going all the way across your body. It get that thing mobilized and moving because when you get ready to do that forward press here or when you get ready to do push-ups, you got to have that shoulder ready to handle those stresses with compensations in place. But you better damn make sure that you go back at night and work on those static limitations. Static stretching without dynamic, no good. Dynamic stretching without static, useless. All right, so guys, big difference. Hopefully poster gate has now been resolved and you guys understand that. Again, I few videos up in this video for you cuz I think you very helpful. But the fact of the matter is, guys, when you want to train, you got to train with a purpose. You got to train like an athlete. Everything matters. There between there stretching. There a separation of dynamic and static. There There weights you before heavy and light. There everything matters. Everything matters when you working out, go do whatever the hell you want to do. But if you want to train, then everything matters. These guys right here, by the way, five guys that I also worked with on that team, Carlos Beltron, David Wright, Paul Duka, Carlos Delgado, and Jose Reyes, all allstars. And they just train like athletes, they prepare like athletes as well. All those guys prepared to be the best that they could be because they were they were the best. they knew how to handle all aspects of their preparation. So, when you want to start taking your performance or even just your physique to the next level, guys, this is what we talk about at Athletex. Prepare like you really want that. And you can do that with our Athletex training system. It ax.com. If you haven already, join me on team Athleene. Let me coach you guys every step of the way to make sure I can get the best out of you like those guys and like Damian. In the meantime, guys, let me know if this was helpful.

STRETCHING - Strength Builder OR Strength Buster (REVEALED!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3ThBxX4W1M	ATHLEAN - X	today I three rubber bands and that sloppy drawing behind me are going to determine how much weight you not in your next workout it Reese [Music] what x.com we how you can maximize your strength at every workout and not allow yourself to lose your potential strength because you work out we stretching before workout the wrong kind can actually make you lose strength how your overall flexibility can impact how much you lift and also the type of exercises you off right here kind of breaking out the eighth grade biology book but I want to show you inside of a muscle this is an actual contractile unit of a muscle fiber so this is what time you Flex that bicep or any other muscle to make it go from an elongated position to a flexed position what we have are two protein components we won get tooo much into detail here but actin and mein this being mein this being actin and the way that a muscle contracts is that it reaction but these little links here these little lines these red lines are attached to the acting fiber right here now these will actually actually act like a ratchet so when we start to contract these things all kind of turn this way down this way okay and they pull this in so that what you this a longer line in here longer line in here and then this is closer so basically when you contract these little pieces of the of the myosin are grabbing on and pulling the muscle in and sliding it in this way all right that as I want you to know because what happens is when we stretch too much before a workout this is remember this whole thing is relying on the ability for this black line to be able to connect to that red line and pull together if you stretch too much before you work out let me show you what happens all of a sudden the black line sits out here like this okay out here because we further apart so now what happens is these red lines no longer can link onto this black line it can see even this last little piece here can to grab on to and there pull or cause a contraction so what does all this mean for your ability to work out and work out with the the most strength you can have the fact is if you for a minute or so or two minutes before even even sometimes as little as 45 seconds or 50 seconds you know during before a set or before your workout of what of the muscle you out you tend to cause this disturbance in the relationship between these the length relationship between these two elements here so when you go to try to work out you just don strength and it was nothing that happened anywhere else you could have eaten properly you could have slept properly but because you did your static stretching before you worked out you screwed this up and now you to have the strength there now will it bounce back yeah it will bounce back but it that muscle to recuperate start to link up onto here this will start to sink back in here a little bit more so that these at least these first two can grab and then they further and further but again it takes a while for that to link up and it may not link up right away so your your your strength is not where it should be so that out the rubber bands to show you the next thing how your overall flexibility can hurt what you do do well it about with athenex developing what we call elastic strength that elastic functional strength I have three rubber bands here this one is one of those little short ones I don you can see it but it you would kind of I guess put in your hair if you had hair you know to tie it back or like a braces uh rubber band you can see that it a lot of room to play with here this kind of represents the big bulky body Builder the guy that doesn it flexibility the ability to generate enough tension so that when I try to shoot it it basically drops right down to the ground okay on the other end of the spectrum we have our sort of hard Gainer body type the guy that has a lot of flexibility but doesn lot of muscle or strength behind it so that what you get when you try to develop tension here is it tends to just sort of again flop straight down because there length and flexibility of the muscles but when you have your athene rubber band okay when you have this perfect relationship of strength and tension and length right we have the ability to then take our muscle which is already kind of strong intense stretch it because we have that flexibility built in and then shoot it very quick very powerful very explosive very strong so that leads right into our last section here is what are the type of exercises that you doing you want to build into all of your exercises the ability to pre-stretch the muscle in a way that we that rubber band stretch effect going on you want to have the strength built in already because you type of stretching you want to have your overall flexibility where it needs to be to be at that perfect balance of strong and still lean and and muscular right we we don and when you combine all that together and you exercise that that you can all right so important little lesson here all put together on board the bottom line is you got to do the right stuff you got to do the right type of exercises and you have to have the right type of flexibility we build it all in into the exercises in athlean X so if you haven there it science behind the strength into the athletex training system head over to athl x.com right now grab the program start seeing what it be strong to not only be flexible but to be both and then ultimately powerful be back here again next week with more videos if you like the Whiteboard stuff I know it can become a little bit nerdy at times but if you like it let me know I you guys

Mobility Drills vs Flexibility Stretches (Which is MORE Important?)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtOVvlgcCEU	ATHLEAN - X	what today I want to talk to you about the difference between two words we hear a lot about flexibility and Mobility there are two different words obviously but they have two very different meanings when it comes to getting your body ready to train it your best the difference guys between flexibility and Mobility is that flexibility is going to deal mostly with tissue length and Mobility is going to deal mostly with tissue temperature or how warm your body is and how loose you feel so let me show you exactly what the difference is with a couple of examples first of all let flexibility when we talk about flexibility you guys have heard me talk about Dynamic and static flexibility and we want to make sure that we most of our static flexibility static stretching before we go to bed at night as we heal our muscles will tend to heal shorter we want to make sure that we do that and we do that over the course of time because a consistent effort on our static flexibility will produce increases in length so if you have a muscle that runs from A to B here the person that has the muscle that runs from A to B here has a more flexible muscle the muscle length is longer it more flexible that is is what you working on when you do those types of static stretching drills you to get the muscle to slowly but surely increase its length so you have more available range of motion that is flexibility when we talk about Mobility we temperature of the joint so if you have a joint that has the flexibility from here to here and another person has a flexibility from here to here but this person is mobile and this person is immobile okay we that emotion but this person may not move this far he may have the length that this guy has here of the muscle belly but he can doesn surrounding joint to express the full flexibility so perfect example so he might wind up being more like this functionally so a good example of that would be with your okay I might have the flexibility in my lats to get all the way up through here up to vertical and Beyond with my arm but I may not have the mobility in my shoulder to get up to this point so my Mobility is limiting my potential flexibility and until I work on my Mobility I fully Express the flexibility that I actually have so where does mobility fit in with your training Mobility is something that you could do before your workouts it your workouts and our static our Dynamic stretching is a form of Mobility work because you don joints right tissue temperature the warmth of the joint the more it starts to feel like you through your your mobility issues the looser you feel remember another differentiation between flexibility and Mobility is going to be one is an exact objective measurement where another one is more of a subjective feeling a Mobility a flexibility deficit is going to show up in inches or centimeters whereas a Mobility deficit will feel like stiffness you ever hear or feel like you know you have great flexibility through your arms or through your shoulders but you feel stiff that feeling of stiffness regardless of what your flexibility is is something that usually comes with a mobility issue so if you stiff that you can work through as you warm up you that you have to do and again you could do that before your workout here one last example what I did was I took two bands cuz I want to show you that Mobility doesn just isolate itself to uh joints it definitely applies there component to tissue as well to muscle tissue as well this band here is a regular athenic extreme band this band is actually starting to thaw out but this one was in the freezer for a while so this is a lot colder band this one nice and warm I could take it and stretch it very easily some good you know there through this band I movement whereas this cold band I definitely am pulling you know harder to get almost as much if I can I still feel like I don other band a matter of fact this band is even fraying as I do this an ice cold band it its edges and know you can it from there but the edges are actually starting to come up and fray so you can see that trying to take a cold muscle and work with it can be a bad idea so you want to make sure that you properly warm mobile before you get into some of your lifting exercises and some of your other activities whether it be professional sports or just Recreational Sports Mobility flexibility two very different things mobility and flexibility two things that you to need if you want to perform at your highest level guys the cool thing here with athletex is there work on your Mobility we more and more of these Mobility type uh videos that we do so you guys can learn from them but at the same time a properly written and properly devised exercise program will work on your Mobility cuz it through ranges of motion you may not be used to going through and by going through those ranges of motion either during the warm-up or during the actual exercise itself you improving your Mobility which will have an effect of improving your flexibility because if you have good flexibility you express it by having a more mobile joint that these muscles cross so I hope that makes sense if you guys found that helpful make sure you leave a comment and a thumbs up below and if you want a program that takes you through the necessary ranges of motion to work on your Mobility while you you the same time then head to aex.com right now and grab our 90day training program and uh as I said leave your comments whatever else you I upcoming videos all right guys thanks a lot	Success
Mobility and Flexibility Overdose (WHEN ITÂS TOO MUCH!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk5kJgf_u6k	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] are you finished yet [Music] [Music] we interrupt this successively long mobility and stretching routine to get you back to your regularly schedu [Music] workout all right good you you Loose as you this workout the problem is a lot of guys are actually turning their warm-ups into workouts and I wanted to address that here today yes we little bit of fun at it because it something you probably see in the gym some guys will literally show up now an hour before their workout at least 30 minutes before their workout just to get ready for their workout meanwhile four or five years ago that didn all so where where is the happy medium what what should we be doing what should you be doing when you get to the gym to get ready for your workout now as a physical therapist believe me I value mobility and flexibility you have to make sure that you joints just as much as you to the show muscles that you in the gym trying to develop as athletes we need to make sure that we as well as we can and that starts with the mobility of our joints but I you this if you think that you need to go through a 30 minute a 20 minute sometimes guys are doing it for an hour routine to get ready for a workout then you might be doing the wrong workouts one of the bigger issues I see today is not that guys are not not mobile enough to attack a workout it range of motion sucks so bad that when they go to train they opportunity to work on the mobility if you take your exercises through a full range of motion and I mean a full range of motion so if we lat pull down that bar is going all the way up which guess what is great for shoulder and thoracic mobility and you bring it all the way down you taking your body through a full range of motion yes you through their full range of motion which is good you better muscle gains by doing that but more so it actually taking the joints and getting your shoulders through full elevation and tying in shoulder elevation with thoracic extension so that we the functional carryover that we need that we probably can avoid with all the extra stuff now granted some guys have individual Orthopedic concerns they got to break out a foam roller because they have such bad uh kyphosis in their back right this kind of positioning that they need to work on mobility and they don have a physical therapist like me around that can actually do manual mobilization down there spine so a foam roller is a great tool to do that but doesn you have to do the PEC stretch as well could be because a pet could actually get tight if you yeah maybe that and then you out your hamstrings then you out your calvs then someone told you it someone say it your adductors right then make sure you got to take out the rolling stick I didn can start massaging you your your thighs and massaging your your your arms and your shoulders and then you got your stretches you got to make sure you do all your stretches that goes guys don because you these things you keep adding to your routine and adding to your routine and before you know it you spending any time working out and that where you the most impact I one thought one of the bigger problems we have is not strengthening ourselves in the range of motion that we have so if you come into a gym and you start doing your your temporary Mobility techniques like your static stretching which we talk about all the time should not be done prior to your workouts but you stretching to give yourself more room in a in your hamstrings you to elongate your hamstrings before you go do your your exercise if you can control the weight in that new temporary range of motion that you gave yourself you might set yourself up for an injury you might be doing more harm than good you need to be able to control your strength within your available range of motion within your active range of motion meaning what is the range of motion that you can actively get yourself into and if you range of motion you the weight in that range of motion and progressively get stronger that range of motion that you motion just to feel as if you can move through an exercise with a little bit more freedom but you don strength in that extra range of motion cuz you because you don that lot more depth on this and I actually will go into a lot more depth on this matter of fact that our first first athlet X live event we this entire Topic in uh in in its entirety however and if you haven heard about our event guys you can go to athleanx.com aen x-live and sign up for our live event it August that being said you got to start bringing it back to reality a little bit guys you can get in with a nice warmup for your body in about 5 to 8 minutes get your heart rate going get a little bit of a sweat going you could do that through jump rope you could do that on a on a elliptical you could do that whatever whatever makes you feel loose and ready to go you can go through whatever you two or three Mobility drills are that are specific to your circumstances if you have a circumstance but if you not you and you want to get going you got to get into your workouts and in those workouts take your exercises through full range it is the best way for you to adapt utilize the mobility that there in your joint to increase that as you increase your strength if you going to be doing squats squat as deep as you can increase the mobility of your hips take that through all of your exercises like I said the laat pull down as well if you guys found this maybe a little bit refreshing and maybe even a little bit relieving so you don like you have to turn these these 30 or 40 minute workouts into hour and 40 minute sessions then leave your comments and thumbs up below and make sure you let me know whatever else is that you want to see and I these videos ahead all right guys I be back here again soon	Success
Pre Squat Warm Up Routine (NO MORE STIFF SQUATS!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wlpds4meE8M	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what next.com the squat is by far one of the most basic and fundamental movements that should be in your training program however if your body this exercise it can actually wreak havoc on your body we have to make sure we address that today I you a very fast routine two minutes that you can do pre- squat to get your body more ready to squat and here we got to make this distinction right off the bat if if you lacks the mobility literally lacks the physical mobility in your hips or in your low back where we and feel where your hip can certain range of motion because you just don this routine is not going to fix that what this routine is going to do is help you overcome stiffness before squatting and stiffness is actually a much more common problem stiffness is that you actually have the mobility you just don at this moment because you the more you work through that the the more you increase okay so how do we do this we going to do six reps of everything I show you here it starts right here with the first exercise which you grab your toes and try to sink down as low as you can into the bottom position of a squat again six reps next we move on to the ability of our thoracic spine to extend so here we want to say can we get our thoracic spine to go backwards even a little bit more to keep our chest up and out so we got to do that with this quick little drill here hands behind your head you allow your body to curl over into flexion and then you want to come out into extension and allow your arms to actually lead the way let your elbows lead the way six reps here then we want to work on something a lot of us don work on and that is our thoracic rotation and it component even though we in squats we much Mobility through the thorasic spine as possible and we need to incorporate what I going to actually hook with your left hand onto to your right foot and let your left elbow actually help to drive you into this right rotation where I lifting my arm upwards to the sky on the right side getting as much rotation as I can and of course alternating and going back to the other side you go and aim for six reps to each Direction here as well now let and now that we that thoracic spine as much as we can we have to try to take it to the next level and thoracic extension becomes a lot more difficult when our arms are up over our head so we perform a version of an overhead squat Mobility drill so here you try to do the same thing you did before but keeping your arms up and over your head again trying to maintain that extension in the thorax spine and also down into the lumbar spine and then finally we and try to tie things together by combining a few of these motions so we challenge that thoracic extension in that more difficult version with the arms overhead and immediately go into a rotation in the thasc spine right and left so why are we doing this because I never think that you should sort of isolate planes of motion because whenever you get into a real weight room situation or even out of the field of competition you move an isolated planes you want to try to combine things in the way that is more applicable to what you actually going to encounter and guys I say it all the time if you want to look like an athlete you an athlete athletes move in all three planes all the time if you for a program that will combine all the elements of training and challenge you in all three planes the way it should it because you your body is meant to be training the first first place you can get that in the athletex training system over at aex.com in the meantime if you looking for more of these videos on Mobility I know this is one of the popular topics and requests just make sure you leave your comments below tell me what you want to see and I best to bring them to you here in the days ahead all right guys I back here again soon	Success
Quadratus Lumborum Stretch (DOÂS AND DONÂTS!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXh1oLXb6zk	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what if you that kind that feels like it deep area that you just can going to tell you it muscle right here your quadrus lumborum and I things that you to try to get rid of that discomfort and one thing you although some might tell you to do it you see this muscle right here can get you pretty jacked up if it up the fact is at the top it attaches to your 12th rib so if it and it affect your whole torso CU your rib cage is going to move on the bottom here is connected to your pelvis so obviously if it one side of your pelvis and give you sort of that unequal pelvis which can play Havoc with everything in your entire body realizing that this is one big kinetic chain that you move on and then of course to cap it all off it connected to your lumbar vertebrae so if it lumbar vertebrae you some problems too so what is it that you want to do I stretch it I work on the soft tissue I show you that one thing you never want to do to it okay so let stretch and first of all how is this muscle getting tight in the first place easily you see when you sleep if you have a side that you like to sleep on let this hiking of this hip up here right relative to the rest of our pelvis is going to tighten the ql on that side so if you sleep on one side all the time the one that get tight he same thing happens here if you your seat and you sort of sit on one side like this if you work on the computer or if you sit on the other one you can see that this hip is hiked up in relation to the rest of a level pelvis or the rest of my spine which means that that ql on that side is going to get tight so what you want to do is you want to set yourself up in this 9090 position if your left hip your left ql is tight you want to put that one behind you so you get 90° here okay so my leg is going to be bent at 90° at the knee and at 90° at my hip if I can so I get in this position my front leg gets here out in front of me at 90° here at my knee and about 90 deges here with the relation relation to the rest of my torso from here I want to open up this hip right so the idea is to drive the top of this pelvis down and back as I get the rest of my body and my rib cage going in the opposite direction here here so if I drive that that back by leaning forward and I lean in this direction I can already feel that muscle opening up now if I want to intensify that even more I and over the top because I lumbar vertebrae now away from the uh direction that I the muscles are stretching even more so I then leaning forward and I can feel that and the more I can drive this leg down and back in that direction there as I do this I stretch okay now the next thing you want to do is work on that soft tissue so you can and hope that the middle of it is going to get worked as well you got to work on the tissue quality in between the origin insertion so what we could do is we can take anything this is literally the end of a battle rope because I have it right here next to me but you could use a lacrosse ball or some other I the fat grip before to mobilize what you position right here first of all as I go into this position here you can see that I because I have the hip being pulled down here and the rib cage being pulled away from it but I I of muscle that I showed you earlier on Raymond okay in there once I it I should already start to feel it because I a pre-stretch I want to try to do is with compression on this thing floss the muscle back and forth through there so I could do that by taking this leg and driving it up here it all the way up actually working the muscle in external rotation accessory motion of the hip and then down and point it and turn it in okay so extending it all the way out pulling my hip down as much as I can with it depressing that pelvis and then getting that internal rotation accessory motion so up up and then down and point it up and down and point it and you can roll just a little bit on that spot lateral to the spine okay because that going to lead to the last thing that you let area okay so what not to do get rid of the foam roller if you the quadr Borum it group and no matter how much you try to be precise with this you just can as precise as you can with something smaller like I suggested before and what winds up happening here is I things even if I stay lateral here and I get away from the spine this thing is so wide that it my rib cage you can actually have a lot of discomfort just from doing that you the muscle because you discomfort from having this drive up into your rib cage the next thing people will do instead is they over the back this way and I can tell you the fastest way to have your back hurt is to try to roll your lumbar spine it in the thoracic spine but trying to drive through extension with a foam roller in the lumbar spine is a sure recipe for disaster and more pain so I hope you guys got the tactics that you want to use here uh and can use them now and apply them to getting that ql to release I one side or the other that because of the things that we do every day or at night when we got to address them because they going to rear their ugly head when you try to go squat with a pel uh a tilted pelvis or when you try to a deadlift with one leg being able to drive more Force into the ground than the other it you found this video helpful make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know what other types of videos you want me to cover what other issues you might be having that I can cover for you here on this channel and I will if you program that puts everything into a complete training program putting the science back in strength to allow you to train at your highest level then head to athletes.com right now and get our athl next training system all right guys I be back here again real soon	Success
Stop Stretching Your Hamstrings (UNTIL YOU WATCH!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1sfPfsESDQ	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] What athleenex.com. So, we address a very important topic here. We want to find out if you are an ass or an ass not. And I were to look at yourself in the mirror and be serious with yourself and and honest, would you be someone who has your butt sticking way out and therefore an ass or are you sort of an ass not where everything is tucked underneath? I gotta admit I asnot. And it of our pelvis. And I a in a video on anterior pelvic tilt, which is very common problem. If you haven video right here. It will tell you a lot about what to do to correct that. However, hamstrings are going to be tight in people that have anterior pelvic tilt or posterior pelvic tilt. Asses are as knots. And we have to figure out a way to address that hamstring tightness. Or do we? Because in that video I said you hamstrings if you have an anterior pelvic tilt, but it want to address. Matter of fact, you want to do the direct opposite. You want to continue to strengthen them and not stretch them. So, first of all, how would you tell whether you have an anterior or posterior pelvic tilt? Most of all, you want to look in the mirror, like I said. So, if you were to look and just lift your shirt and look here, you want to focus on the waistline. So, whatever you your pants, what position is the waistline? you little bit of a downward tilt to it. A little bit about three or four degrees. If you have this severe downward tilt, then you pelvic tilt position here. And that actually not a good thing to have. I know it looks better, but it good thing to have. It shortening that you want to correct. At the same time, if you have a posterior pelvic tilt, you a level line here of the pants, or worse, it could even be tucked under, so it starts to tilt up at the top. The second thing you can do is do an excursion test. How much room do you get? So, if let tilter, if I tried to go into more anterior tilt, in other words, try to tip my pelvis down, I would only be able to get a few degrees because I anterly tilted. I don motion left to go in that direction. But if you asked an anterior tilter to go posterior tilt, look what happens. I got all that extra room because I had a lot left in that direction. Same thing if I you tell me to tilt and tuck my butt under, I much further because I That anterior tilt, I can probably get a lot more. Of course, it would feel tight, but it in. So, do that test and figure out what you are. But now, when you come over here, do you want to stretch or not stretch? Well, think about what happening. Again, I said tight hamstrings regardless of whether you anterior or posterior. If you are anterior, look what hamstrings are attaching from the back here of your pelvis down to your knee to the outside of your knee or behind your knee. They actually cross the knee. If my pelvis was anterly tilted and pushing in this direction, what to the hamstrings at their origin? They as this is tilting forward, it up and over and it hamstrings to be tight. But guess what? The hamstring tightness is not causing this anterior tilt. the hamstrings are being stretched because of the anterior tilt. So, the tight hip flexors on the other side are pulling this down this way. That tight. But you wouldn these because all that let the h the hip flexors on the front side do more damage, pull you more into anterior tilt and cause the problem to become worse. What you relieve the hip flexors, which is what I made that video about. That will show you then how to reset the pelvis back. Guess what happens? All of a sudden, all this extra stretch goes back down nice and there hamstrings. On the other side, though, if you got problems. You hamstrings cuz what they pulling down more, which is going to take our pelvis down into this posterior pelvic tilt, that no ass look where it going to tuck under underneath here. Your main problem is going to be tight hamstrings. And guess what else? because it crosses the knee here. It shift the focus. I here of your body to do this. I tuck under. I start leaning a little bit more forward. My weight is going through my toes. My toes are act or you know by pushing through my toes. What as well? My calves. I start getting shortening in my calves and my Achilles. So now I can flexion at my feet here because my calves are tight. So, you want to figure out a way to stretch your calves at the same time that you hamstrings, at the same time that you not allowing yourself to be in posterior tilt. You got to go out of that. So, how can we do that? Well, we could do what I foot up against the uh anything something that allows me to have elevation here. And then the next thing I can do is I want to get my knee straight obviously. Okay. So I through the hamstring and then through back through the calves. And then I antly tilt this way. So now the the big key is I put one foot back which allows me to tilt more this way. You can see I can go more into anterior tilt right there. I don I don actually can just stand right there and feel the stretch. But then I want to kind of reach up in front of me. Why am I reaching up if I my hamstring? Because as I go down, I still want to be able to keep my upper back elongated here. Because it because what happens when we get posterior tilt, everything rounds. You walk around like this. So, we got to get elongation through here. So, I leaning up as I go. I swear I want to rip my [\\xa0__\\xa0] leg off. I here. I have tight hamstrings. Going up here and I can already feel the stretch. Again, we all at one time. But that you because if you are an ass, don them. Do something else. Worry about strengthening them. Guys, I hope the differentiation was made here and made it clearly. As again, I made that other video about anterior pelvic tilt that a lot of guys found helpful and you going to want to see it because it common problem. But this differentiation I kind of glanced over and I want to make sure I went into it a little bit more in depth so you understand it. If you that that teach you how to do these things the right way so that you kind of left guessing and you figuring out, well, I guess I should stretch because the guy told me hamstring stretching is good. My hamstrings are tight, stretch them, not all the time. You stretch them when you find that over at athletex.com in the Athletex training system. In the meantime, if you found this video helpful, leave your comments and thumbs up below. Let me know. Ass or ask not, doesn out what the right thing for you is to do. All right, guys.

Shoulder Mobility Balancing Act (CAREFUL!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ2anAlfY1g	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com today we look inside your shoulder to see just how important it is that you on those things that you might think are unimportant especially the small things when you things and the bigger lifts in the gym because right here this represents your shoulder and we marker or at least half of one to show you that your shoulder actually looks something like this and what I representing here is the ball in the socket and the first thing you need to realize is that socket ain ball is much bigger than it and that means two things number one lots of ability to move your the the ball of uh of the the upper arm around so you can do lots of things you can move your arms in all crazy planes much more motion you kind of does this and maybe a little bit of twisting okay that sacrificing the stability of your shoulder because of this and we only have three things that we can focus on in order to arm ourselves the best way to have a much more stable shoulder and stay injury free when we those big lifts so the first thing that you want to make sure that you focusing on is the laborum and that is keeping the health of your laborum as a high priority now dumb me was in baseball as you guys know and I got bet by one of our players that I couldn throw the ball from right field to third base on the fly now I should have known better but it just looks so damn close to me from out there that I tried and I am not equipped to be throwing a baseball like that especially not warmed up at all I took my hardest throw as I possibly could it certainly didn it all the way there and as soon as I did I felt a big tear right through my shoulder I could feel like a burning sensation I tore my lab I dealing with it ever since why does that matter because the laum actually deepens this socket so what it job is to try to create some more depth and stability inside this shoulder joint so while it was sitting on top of that little pen cap realizing that that surface here is much smaller than the ball itself let out to illustrate a second point and that is if there was no laum there the ball would have to sort of do this balancing act on a very shallow surface okay but with the laum intact we actually creating more depth and we creating much more stability here for the to stay inside the socket while it moves so you want to do everything you can to not do stupid like me and tear your laum okay that that can happen traumatically or it can happen over time but the things that happen over time are generally because you have bad mechanics in the other two areas I one there is going to be your rotator cuff so we talk about the rotator cuff all the time and those are the muscles that wrap around and interplay with each other there them are really really important to interplay with this humor to keep it centered As you move your arm up and down so if as you were moving your arm up over your body it also wanted to move up and migrate up you because you with the sup spinous tendon inside this the shoulder joint itself causing inflammation btis all these bad things that lead you to go like ow every time you try to lift a bar or dumbbell overhead so it centered and we want to make sure to do is train those muscles now I put a whole video together on spe specific exercises that you can do with your rotator cuff but here video I here focus on as well mostly external rotation and when we talk about external rotation it can happen in many different planes of motion it can be with my elbow right here at my side that way it could be more of a diagonal cross pattern where I reach down this way and then come up and overhead that look more like a throwing athlete but we want to make sure that we strengthening the external rotation because that does allow us to keep this humorous again centered in here on this very shallow slightly deepen surface because of the lab the next thing we want to do is focus on the third component and that is the capsular element to this the capsule is a series of of structures that wrap around the head of the humorus that tighten and loosen depending upon the position that you move your arm in and one of the things that we find ourselves constantly and chronically in is this forward rounded position and a lot of times what tightness because of the fact that we posturally are sitting in these positions all the time and that could become come from muscle imbalance it could be come from a lack of attention to the external rotators whatever it might be if you rounded this way then you better probably surmise that you also have a real bad capsular tightness too so if you have rounded shoulders what you might want to start doing is stretching out the posterior capsule of your shoulder now why is that because as you get anterior you get weakened anteriorly this muscle the this head of the humorus sits forward and it this part of the the shoulder capsule and that back gets Tighter and Tighter which is even further pushing this forward this way okay so we want to be able to stretch that out back and you could do that by doing this sleeper stretch here you lay down on the ground put your elbow in the position I here make sure that you stabilizing up against the ground you pushing against your form and you trying to go down into internal rotation which is going to push this heavy humorous backwards into that capsule and stretch it out you bone itself to push back into that capsule and stretch it out you should feel a pretty big stretch by doing that as a matter of fact from an anterior side we get chronically loose and weak because all we do is have this thing pushing forward and we could even aggravate that as I by doing peex stretches like this that people always sort of tend to do and we can link that here why you don do that but the idea is that you quickly want to realize that the interplay of keeping a healthy labor room of keeping good balance between all the muscles of the rotator cuff and by keeping this sort of attention to the posture that you the shoulder capsule and the ligaments and what the the balance between those are is ultimately going to say this shoulder feels good or this shoulder does not feel good and when you go to the big lifts like a bench press like a overhead shoulder press the things that are going to help you to add muscle in the gym if you can every time you move your shoulder around there you you of a a lot of disappointment and that shouldn the little things the big things will become that much easier and that athletex is all about we put the science back in strength here to help you understand why these things matter and not just tell you to go do them cuz once you have an appreciation for why it matters it makes it a lot easier for you to want to actually do them we actually incorporate them into our Athletics training programs in the right balance so that you know that you things right that in the meantime if you found this video helpful if you always like when Raymond makes an appearance

If You Could Only Do 1 Stretch... (BEFORE YOU LIFT!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiMdrw0KyVU	ATHLEAN - X	what today we are going to talk about the stretch but I want to start by saying this as a physical therapist stretching and Mobility work and all those things have sort of become so non-prescriptive they are doing the things because they look cool or that people have told them to do and that don certainly if don Mobility drill you shouldn cuz all you might be doing is contributing more to your problem that being said what I here today is going to help a problem that almost all of us have I would say virtually every single one of us has a problem where in our thoracic spine so what is that area first of all it area of your spine that midback you basically we all know we have our lumbar spine which is our lower back our cervical spine which is right here in our neck and then we it and that what we lose here is we lose the ability to extend through it okay because we get more and more and more and more flexed and you know what this looks like you can probably look at yourself right now don notice that you this if you watching this video so why do we have that because we spend a lot of time with the keyboard because we spend a lot of time driving because we spend a lot of time texting because we spend a lot of time with our hands in front of our body and we spend a lot of time letting gravity beat us as we go down down down down so so we need the ability to thoracic extend here we can extend we also can rotate try this right now get all the way down here and then try to rotate you lock yourself up you don ability that you do as soon as I extend now I can rotate much more freely because I also test how much Mo movement I have at the shoulder when I get here in this flexed position of thoracic spine and I try to raise my arm up I get locked that I extend now I can go all the way up back here more got a lot more ability to raise my arm up safely over my head so think about every excise that that impacts almost every single exercise you do lower body or upper body so why do we want to fix it well we want to be able to have something that we can do before a workout you might be the type Jeff I don going to help you thoracic extension and rotation at the same time take a bar a dow a wooden a wooden bar or anything lay on your stomach okay now we one side to post off of and the other side to rotate towards so what you going to do is you here okay we off of and you your leg down at that side so you going to rotate here all the way through until you feel that stretch if you let this leg come up with you you really challenging the rotation in your spine you basically just came and fell on your back so you want to keep this one knee in contact with the ground and come back now Jess if you come up on top of me you can see that I extension through my thoracic spine or as much as I have which is better than just letting it stay flexed and stuck and I hips in One Direction and rotated my shoulders in the other direction so I got that rotation going on and then we it feels great going to post up off of this side here come up and then rotate oh my God so again we spine and rotation together so do this about two or three times in each Direction here up and each time you it gets a little bit easier okay I let my knee come up a little bit on that one keep it down right there all right so again too much of all all this random stretching and Mobility work going on especially as I said it gets under the skin of a physical therapist but prescriptiveness is important I can pretty much tell you that prescriptively everybody needs to do this and if you just do this one little drill it will help you no matter what you that day all right guys if you found the video helpful make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up Below in the meantime if you that tries to do it the right way Tres to prescribe the things that you need at the right time that you need them then head to aex.com and get our X training system if you found the video helpful again leave your comments and let me know what you want me to cover what else you want me to do here for you and I do my best to cover in a future video all right guys see you	Success

10 Best Mobility | Flexibility Drills (PRE-WORKOUT)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dT4KHtMM-A	ATHLEAN - X	what don ready to work out you don today I routine one that sort of flows from movement to movement to movement that going to get you ready in in a lot of different ways to prepare your body to train all right I into it basically what you want to do is start with something that gets the posterior chain loose because it of the the areas that gets most tight on us our hamstrings our backs so you start with an inchworm you literally come down here and you out when you get to the bottom it just about flexibility guys you want also stability too and we have stability by getting our shoulders in this position here we walk ourselves back we shoulder joint that your shoulders you probably when you come down because you kind of kick forward and then you can get them straight maybe about here well the goal is on each successive rep to try to get your hamstrings to be able to stay back by keeping your knees back further and further on each rep okay you work your way all the way out 10 reps on the last one you come right down again I said there next you get in this 9090 position here 90° at this hip 90° at that hip back there okay just like this now we want to get a lot done in one stretch so we lean out over this forward knee which is going to stretch the hell out of this forward hip here and then we hook our elbow on the top of that knee here like that so that we get this added stretch of the lats in the back side posterior shoulder capsule here on that side and then we reach out this way with our arms okay 5 Seconds come out of it go back down and do it again this is not a static holding routine this is a dynamic stretching routine to get yourself prepared to train so you don sit here and hold forever so we lean in and then we come out of it and we swap the feet up we do the same thing on that last rep here you do five to each side on that last rep you just straighten yourself out come down now we got to work on that spine a little bit so in this position here we our body leave the the leg trailing back there and keep your arms reached up overhead so that we thoracic extension right that middle of the spine getting it to be able to lean back more here let gravity help you and then you come down and you roll yourself to the opposite side you getting some good mobility in here through your lumbar spine feeling nice and loose and of course stretching that top hip just like that and you keep alternating five and five to each side there then on that last rep you come into this position here you sit up Put Your Hands back open up your chest get your shoulders and uh and your your chest stretched out here into this reverse table when you get up here drive up activate your glutes reach push through here reach across your your body and go as far as you can so now we getting a stretch on the hip flexor on the on this leg mostly you compression through this shoulder joint which is good for activating the muscles inside that the stabilizers inside your shoulder and of course you more of that thoracic extension here and rotation okay that way you come down alternate open reach push as hard as you can through your glutes to activate them alternate for five on each side then we stand up here we stand up and we go now into the three-way lunge we step out here lunge reach back now we hip flexor on this side but we getting glute activation on the the front leg reach don long three-way lunge we now 45° step and lean back towards the planted leg now we bit of a groin stretch at this oblique angle here we glute activation at this 45° angle and then we step back and we step straight to the side again lean back in that direction really stretching the abductors and groin on this leg at the same time we on the right hand side and still having that glute activation three five times of the three-way sequence on this leg five times of the three-way sequence on that side now it gets ugly the hamstring pulses nobody stretches their hamstrings right you have to be in an anterior pelvic tilt if you want to stretch your hamstrings meaning your pelvis has to be in this position not that position if you position it stretch okay it the stretch where it needs to be so what you need to do is you get into this position you lunge out get into the anterior tilt okay get your back arched drop straight down from here okay almost like a sprinter position here now you drive back with the knee got then cave in and lift it in this position here I just dropping down and I knee back these are the pulses one kills two it straight because you hamstring length by having your leg in front of you and now of course we have the pelvis in the right position so it really difficult but you want to try to pulse and get that leg back as straight as you possibly can five times on each leg then we do straighten the leg here let the leg stay locked out get into the anterior tilt and now we do five reaches the reaches start here reach forward as if you from you right here you out of room pretty quick especially if you don right here reach and back reach and back reach you do that five times on each leg then we got to work on finishing this off getting the upper body a little bit loose so now we do something called a can opener but the can opener is if you look at the lower body first you making a mobile rotation rotation internal external and your arms are just kind of following along for the ride but now once you throwing with your right arm it here and then down across your body it up and it you of the posterior shoulder and rotator cuff on the way down and then you opening it up and you chest on the way back okay the other arm just goes along for the ride it travels more across the body this way okay all the way up chop down 10 on this direction and then 10 in the other direction then we want to get those shoulders right before we use them we let again we could do that by just letting gravity help us these are dead shoulder circles so you As Dead As it can be okay don tight try to let it hang as As Dead As you can be and you try to make big circles and your fingers won floor here if you but you should reach for the floor let them almost feel like they can scrape the floor each time do nice 10 big circles feeling as if your shoulder is pulling down a little bit getting a little bit of distraction and loosening up the shoulder joint okay 10 and then 10 the other arm and then finally we have ankle breakers because all of this starts from the ground up you want to make sure that your ankles feel nice and loose and one of the places we get extremely tight is the outside of our calves the panal muscles that run up and down the side so what you do is you step and you allow your foot to bend down okay if you have to cheat it you just step forward a little bit from the start but you on the outside oh believe me this is safe on the outside of your ankle and in your shin and then you just take it you step forward and just turn turn and rotate in the opposite direction okay then flatten everything back out drop it step rotate just like that again three 4 seconds is all you need to do you getting this nice Dynamic stretch of all the ankle muscles there like that okay you go through 10 on each side okay I when I push my hips out that way I getting that nice stretch on the outside of the ankle okay and there you have it guys everything will flow there movement here you got glute activation you got shoulder activation you got shoulder stabilization you got thoracic extension you spine as well you and shoulder capsules to be loose too you from the ground up and you a in a short period of time I can stand when I see people devote 20 minutes and 30 minutes to just a warmup it going to feel nice and loose I don care what workout you use this flow this Matrix we like to call it 10 exercises to feel as great as you can getting ready to attack your training now static stretching is a whole other thing it purpose this is meant to get you ready to train remember guys a plan is necessary if you want to be able to get something done without wasting a lot of time we have a lot of plans over at athlet next.com from your training all the way to your nutrition if you head

Stretching is KILLING Your Gains (BIG MISTAKE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLQefKzMVjo	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com today we about why stretching is killing your games and to demonstrate it I want to start by having us all stand up and do a set of 15 degree ankle dorsiflexion 130 degree knee flexion 110 degree hip flexion lowers lumbar spine stabilizing SCAP retracting forward i gazes okay with it maybe 300 pounds you don what that is see the thing is that just a squat but see your body doesn store that information that way your body recognizes a squat as a squat and you learned it from a very young age and it stored motor pattern that allows us to be neurologically efficient so that when I have to squat like let have a muster marker in my pocket that I drop I don every component that I just listed out for you but in order to get down there yes all that stuff is happening for me to go down here and squat but instead instantly my body knows get down to the ground pick that thing up and go so what happens is when you start to do static stretching holding stretches for 30 seconds 45 seconds some people doing for a minute and a half prior to either training or going out and competing in something you because what you you you readapt on the fly and it doesn do a great job of it especially early on in your training so it compromises your ability to do this so if I were to do that before a squat and I stretch all the things out because guys do everything they quads they hamstrings right they out their hips before they do a squat even up their body because they know they got to get their shoulders back in order to grab the bar they go through this whole process and when they step under the bar the body knows the squat based on what your ability to do that squat isn with this temporary increase in the length that I through my static stretching now when I step onto the bar maybe even if I was stretching my my my forearms out a little bit just cuz people do everything before they squat now when I go in and I grab I could actually turn a back squat a high bar squat into more of a low bar squat just because I have more flexibility here through my forearms at least temporarily right and if I go to squat there that disrupt my motor pattern if my hips are a little bit looser and I go down down the squat when I go down a little bit lower than I bad thing I just have not used to that so now when I trying to state wait is he squatting is that that Engram that I have stored because it doesn there all of its time trying to match up the differences between what it experiencing now versus what you have stored and neurologically you become inefficient that the effort is being spent there rather than maximising your strength and performance here and that where your your lift is compromised so what is static stretching bad no static stretching is a great thing because ultimately it leads to increased muscle length and flexibility that benefit you in the weight room just not right now not before your workout and I tell you how you can do it if you demand and it really what we give you a better way to do it anybody that experience the same thing if I were to go in swing I have a golf swing that what my body has stored is the golf swing okay back and then through there swing but now if I spend all my time static stretching before I go play golf when I step up for the first tee you probably experienced this yourself if you played any length of time all of a sudden the backside my shoulders here and a lot more loose than it usually is so instead of getting to here before I initiate the up part of my swing here now I that changes what hip in order to stabilize the swing so everything is thrown off and I spend the first four holes trying to recapture my ability to match up what it is I trying to do with what my body knows is a golf swing so I might throw away four holes and if I that whole round so finally I more example here if I have a bench press and I spent all my time static stretching out my chest and I you guys some really good static stretches to differentiate between PEC minor and PEC major and they important but just not to be done now before I get to here and do it a set of benchpress because now with this increased flexibility I wind up drifting my arms aren pattern I can efficient here and then focus my effort power and strength development which are both neurologically driven instead I trying to find and match up that stored pattern and even just a little bit of variance here can change things when we static stretch guys we causing a length tension relationship and a difference in the cross bridging of the actin and myosin inside your muscle that helps to create a contraction so even if there little bit lengthen versus the normal we normal so what would you do if you insisted on doing static stretching before you train well you better spend some time now re-establishing what normal so what I mean by that is you go through before you start your training you got to go through and you have to start to do all I think I believe reintegration of these motor patterns by doing the exercises you were going to do that day two or three sets of each one exploring the new ranges of motion that you stretching with lighter weights that could take you an extra 15 or 20 minutes but I believe it goal for that day is to do anything where we especially so the alternative is to spend your time instead doing a quick warm-up and then doing active warm-up right using dynamic stretching activities to get yourself ready not hanging out in prolonged stretching for any length of time but doing dynamic stretches for those same muscle groups and then spending one or two or three sets doing the first exercise you gonna do that day using a nice steady warm-up progression without tiring yourself out just to sort of groove that move and then go get ready to do your workout but if you spend any more time than that doing all your static stretching in the long run I promise you your strength gains are going to be limited by that and ultimately your size gains as well because you can most out of your workouts because your body is simply mismatched in the neural efficiency that you created in the first place is being interfered with and screwed up so guys I hope you found this video helpful in

Stop Stretching Your Hip Flexors! (HERE'S WHY)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCADorwJ6Ik	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com today we all about the hip flexors and more importantly whether or not you should be stretching yours or leaving them alone as a matter of fact you might want to be doing the exact opposite and that is strengthening them i today how to test whether yours are tight or weak and figure out what is a better route for you to go if you want to get rid of the issues that are being caused by your hip flexors right now all right the first thing that needs to be cleared up though is a little bit of anatomy and not to bore you but it really important here is that when we talk about the hip flexors it single muscle group there five muscles that are responsible for flexing the hip three of them the tfl the rectus femoris which is one of the quad muscles and the sartorius which is one of more of a groin muscle they all attach at the level of the hip to the iliac crest so they can only really flex the hip up to the level of the hip but the two that we about are the ones that bring it up higher than that which is the psoas and the iliacus and those are the two that when we talk about all my hip flexors feel tight those are the ones we really talking about because when they back pain you can see why the muscles of the of the psoas here attach to all the lumbar vertebrae they literally go through the body and attach the lumbar vertebrae so when these are tight they could actually be pulling on your lumbar spine and causing all kinds of issues so we need to get to the bottom of whether or not it issues here in your back or whether or not it recommendations are going to be drastically different depending upon which of those two it is all right so let flexibility in the hip because we want to make sure that there is a tightness here before you start going ahead and stretching it because a lot of times what we weakness instead of a tightness but we can do that very easily with a quick test you sit at the edge of a bench here so it you pull both knees up and then drop one down you want to make sure right off the bat that your low back is flat here because what you you this leg the one that contact with the surface you whether it this okay and the second thing you want to look for is whether or not the the knee itself is capable of bending and really ideally down to about 80 or 90 degrees or is it more extended like this or it could be a combination of both because what we want to determine now is if we are in some position here where it the inability to get our knee fully bent we know we have some tightnesses okay but is it a quad tightness the rectus femoris that we talked about or is it more of an actual hip flexor so what you would do is with the knee let floating in this position you would ask the person or you would do it yourself or you just straighten out the knee if by straightening the knee the leg goes down fully in contact with the surface here that means that you have more of a quad tightness or rectus tightness because when you took the quad off of that stretch he relieved it then i was able to go down then everything else was loose enough to be able to get down if on the other hand when you do this and nothing changes or it certainly doesn to the level of the bench well now you in which case that is when you want to actually start using your hip flexor stretches to attack that but a lot of times when you see this yourself you may realize you know what i really don have a tightness and that starts to come back where i said in the beginning you far different you probably a weak hip and i want to show you how to test for that now too okay so let but you still feel that there something off in your hip it causing you to really always want to stretch it and by the way if when you stretch it you tend to get a little bit of temporary relief but then an hour later things are actually worse than they were before then you dealing even more with what we to talk about right now and that is a weak hip flexor that all you stretching it and making it worse so you want to do is you want to have a way to test that on you and we can do that very simply you take a box any surface that allows your knee to be higher than your hip when you put your foot on it okay and then we want to do from here is lift off of that surface okay so stand upright put your hands up behind your head so you can be leaning towards it we don be bringing our chest to the knee we want to be able to bring our knee up to our chest okay and see if you can hold it up here for 15 seconds so lift off of that surface so that your hip is as high as you can flex it actively and then from here see if you can hold it if you start to get a cramp in the outside of your hip which would be in the the tensor area here that weakness in this muscle group here because it another muscle down below that isn really equipped to do what you it to do which is flex above 90 degrees if you remember back to the anatomy we showed earlier the ones that attach at the level of the hip are good at flexing you to that level but they good at flexing you above so by putting ourselves in this position here where our knees already above 90 degrees now the only thing we can do is use either that iliacus or the psoas to try to get us up here and that find a good weakness if it exists the other thing we could do is we don to use this at all we can just stand right here and pull the leg as high as we can right and then dynamically let it go and if when we let it go i can here in this position like that if it drops and it catches guess where at 90 degrees well that little bit of assistance from those other three muscles that are helping out at that level but i don strength to be able to take it up at the above 90 position and hold it up above 90. so that would be a good indication if you hold it here and you drop it and you can until it gets to the level of 90. so let do well that test becomes the exercise you can actually go back in this position here and you do leg lifts right from here so i want to strengthen the hip flexors i put my arms up behind my head and i do leg lifts in that position right and i try to do that and hold that either for time or for reps i could also take it up a notch by taking a band anchoring it down to something low here wrapping it around the foot this way and then now i lift here to add in more strength as our as our hip flexors begin to start getting stronger but the key is this guys you want to find out right from the back and you you actually have a hip flexor tightness because if you don you if you exercises you pain worse if you tightness in in a general feeling of something that is off in the hip that going to get worse if you keep doing that if on the other hand you have a weakness and you don nothing want to find out which of the two you dealing with if it is a tightness then yes the stretchers are going to be appropriate but if they to avoid them if you if you have to guys i always say you got to own it own this if you have a hip flexor weakness then you got to own this and you got to start doing stuff about it and a matter of fact maybe you explosive training and that case and a good argument for getting outside and doing some sprints to actually train to start using those hip flexors above 90 degrees in a more explosive way if you training program guys that puts it all out there and puts it all together so we overlooked nothing in our training that can get our athletics training system

right here Jesse and I know that we muscle gains he tell you this those muscle gains actually would be impossible how not first fixed his posture and for anybody that has followed this channel for any length of time you realize that as a physical therapist I have to prioritize posture especially when we start attacking a strength training program because I don can physically put yourself in position to be as strong as possible if you don first fix your posture so we had to do that with Jesse what did we do we turn around show him what you look like he kind of looked exactly like I just did and you kind of came to me looking like this and if you don you can look at Jesse here for verification that yes that actually how he looked when we started training but knowing that we can him under the bar that way because we asking for problems we had to address one by one starting right here the upper back the thoracic spine being rounded cathodic it actually can your head fully if you position and with that is the second problem the rounded shoulders that come with that and again you shoulder pains if you don a compensation for this posture here if you because it if your body head for that we know we gotta look straight ahead so what do we do we peak up that called nerd neck right there and Jesse appropriately appropriately developed it because he because of all of his star wars infatuation I call him that but beyond that we have other reasons he needs to fix this though and so do you and and really a little bit uncharacteristically Jesse pelvic tilt meaning he gets that swoop in the low back and we actually fixed that and addressed that an entire video that you need to watch if you have that problem and I looks like over here and link it for you at the end of this video but here most of us have step aside just because of all this roundedness what happens in the spine because this one connected unit as we get this posterior pelvic tilt there under this ass not as what we call so basically we have four main issues that we have to do in a dress and we to do that here one by one remember the one thing if you gonna be the most impactful for you you string them all together I promise you with your posture okay let upper back the thoracic kyphosis actually a fun one to do because all it takes is a broomstick Jessie metal bar here but you lay facedown on the floor like that you put your arms nice and wide on the bar and then Jesse here and when he does he trying to get extension through his thoracic spine here and rotation because we like to pay a rotation and extension together because the spine works that way and we always have to respect the rotational plane whenever we do something cuz that he goes back in this direction the bar is actually kind of blocking him by staying in contact with the floor and he out and he to go back the other way he plants down the right side with the bar and he rolls back in that direction opening up the wrestling extension and rotation hanging out at the end for just a couple seconds in each direction do maybe five or six of these in each direction and move on to hit those rounded shoulders next all right guys so now we have to go after those rounded shoulders and the first thing you should know is that a lot of times the rounded shoulders are a consequence of that rounded thoracic spine because once that starts it everything else starts to get rounded around with it but with that comes adaptive shortening because of the muscles in the chest and we want to make sure that we guy better start learning to pull pull pull and in this case we want to do face poles and we want to do them often so a face pole is gonna actually help to develop the muscles on the backside here to counteract all that adaptive shortening on the front you can see when Jesse does this now he basically is working on external rotation as well so as he gets back he thumbs back behind his body this way at the same time working the posterior deltoids at the same time working the rhomboids and the muscles here in the upper back and he about getting here and trying to get out of here as fast as possible it getting here and staying here and then reversing it so you go here for quality reps I sets of one quality rep at a time as opposed to doing one set of ten at least the mentality when you approach this exercise so the face pull out keep these arms as wide as you can work on externally rotating them trying to pull and push the thumbs back in this direction and go one quality rep at a time okay now we have to work on that nerd neck okay and in order to do that you have to realize that because of everything else that chain reaction now usually causes a weakness in the deep neck flexors here in the front of your neck so you don just want to do these neck flexion resisted exercises with a plate you want to also make sure that you your chin back so you can really activate the deep neck flexors so what you do is you take a tennis ball like this and Jessie here between his sternum and his chin okay just like that to engage heat forces him to have to pull his neck back he takes a ten pound plate or a five pound plate wrapped in a t-shirt or a towel he goes down just enough to be into slight extension and he goes back up and flexes into neutral but the whole time he flexors by keeping that tennis ball between his sternum and his chin and then going through this really small movement here again quality repetitions when you talk about fixing posture it is not about trying to rack up set after set after set it quality rep quality rep and quality rep one at a time that most okay lastly we have to attack that pelvis okay and the pelvis is really the base of all the stuff that here because it literally supporting all this bad [\\xa0__\\xa0] that Jeff C we talked about how he anterior pelvic tilt but for most of us what happens when all this stuff is rounding forward as it gets tucked underneath and why that is is the hamstrings get short and tight and they start pulling this down and under as I said before the a snap posture it getting rid of your ass you don have a good-looking ass in this position here because it disappearing so if I grab the camera here I could actually show you how we can fix this if I get right here with Jessie now I can tell them hey look put your or your foot up on something that you can dorsiflex your foot right point it towards your head and then from there make sure your knees straight want to try to stretch this hamstring out in order to stretch the hamstring out we have to get into that anterior pelvic tilt now for Jessie that into that posterior tilt most of us are going to start like that right that what trouble in the first place but we try to really force our butt out as far as we can and then from there all we have to do if we maintain this anterior pelvic tilt is reach forward with our arms and just reach in this direction as much as possible over here just like this he reaching out towards me that direction but keeping all that the way it was if you see the hamstring he bending a lot at the waist there lot of forward bend here at the waist but because he has himself an anterior tilt that hamstring is really getting lengthen here and that to do you want to make sure again you do this on both sides and you do it for about 45 seconds at a time nice high-quality stretching if you do that I promise you guys you obviously right away but if you work on all four of these things together you fix the pelvis you work on the mid-back you work on those shoulders the neck hopefully again will work it will work itself out but as you increase the deep neck flexors strength as well that going to help - so there you have it guys there is your posture plan of attack and remember as I said it didn take this guy one day to get this way now I long either so if you these changes they can happen you just have to be committed to making the changes and if you in depth breakdowns of the individual conditions from the rounded shoulders to the neck to have an anterior pelvic tilt in Jesse we sure I link them in the description below but I goes a long way and a little bit in high quality goes the longest way so do these things I promise you you results very very quickly again you can feel them instantly you can start to see them adapt and become permanent over time all right now if you a program that puts the science in to everything we do that athleanx program as a physical therapist I lay it all out for you step by step and every single workout we do that you can get that over at athleanx.com and the meantime if I found the video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know what else what I gonna cover and I that for you in the days and weeks ahead see you	Success
Do This EVERY SINGLE Day! (WORKOUT OR NOT)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JObYtU7Y7ag	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com so today I you one exercise that I promise is going to change your life literally because you but it minute maybe a minute and a half to knock this thing out and to start making big big improvements in a lot of different areas number one if you have bad posture rounded shoulders you gonna fix that number two if you have strength imbalances this is gonna go a long way towards fixing that number three if you have maybe some weaknesses on some of the bigger lifts so you can figure out why there you guys you add weight to the bar I gonna show you how to do that and why this is going to have such a big impact and finally maybe you have some mobility issues your shoulders just don the mobility that you wish they would this is going to help that as well by doing this every single day now again you probably think Jeff you never advocate anything every single day I telling you you can do this every day because it exercise it but it with the use of just one single band and more so you must have control over muscles that are inherently weak and ignored alright so what the exercise is is a band pull apart now before you say oh I band pull apart so I knew the answer here no big deal actually I don if you exactly right and that these the right way is gonna help you get all those benefits we just talked about so firstly what do you not want to do when you do a band pull apart you don overhand like this and then pull it apart because that right it that overhand position you internally rotating your shoulder with this elevation to do and perform the exercise and that guys should know by now I don advise you to do any time you can get into external rotation of your shoulder you better position long term because we don don enough so by simply taking this underhand grip here we have to get into an externally rotated position of our shoulder to perform the exercise the second thing a lot of times when people will do is they hundred reps of this just keep doing a hundred reps of these every single day or 150 or 200 reps higher reps I because that here is likely the muscles that need to have all this retraining done are not being done properly they totals of bad rep quality is not going to fix the problem lower rep totals of good quality is going to help you go a long way towards fixing that stuff so high quality lower reps if needed but consistency is the key the next thing you want to make sure that you here is maybe not just doing straight BAM pull-up arts straight to the bat because all you on is one function of the shoulder blades and that is their ability to protract and retract and some people say well isn Bamboula parts is to work more on the retraction ability of your shoulder blades I would argue not really not really because we get a lot of retraction work when we type of rolling or back look well we need to work more on as our ability to develop the strength in the lower traps to develop the strain in our shoulder blades and the stability while we doing upward elevation and downward elevation because as barbell athletes that say we have to press up overhead we need to be able to get up and over right we don here at the level of our shoulders we need to be able to get the arms up overhead and to do that it requires upper rotation of the shoulder blades and scapula as you go up and then downward rotation on the way down but more importantly stability and strength through there so what you want to do is you take that underhand grip on the band you try to get your elbows in a little bit tight and your hands out a little bit wider so right away we get a little external rotation by having the hands wider than the elbows okay not just starting out here or keeping everything directly in line a little bit wider on the hands that on the elbows then when we go and we want to do our pull apart we don plane right even with the shoulder instead we want to go up high from here and then pull down and back up and high down and back and you can see that when I go up you can clearly see the upward rotation of the shoulder blades there and then the downward rotation back towards each other with the round boys still working so we haven sacrificed the activity of that retraction of the shoulder blades by having us still go up over our head into this upper rotation down rotation so again because I have my hands outward and I external rotation activating the rotator cuff we stabilize during that rotation and we still getting that protraction retraction of the shoulder blades so why is this such a big deal why is it so important because again when we talk about strength imbalances it going to be dominant front side to back side I don back side and how much pulling you think you you once a day 20 to 30 reps in high quality it helping to fix this issue the next thing is we talked about mobility a lot of times we can because our arms are naturally internally rotated so that we actually develop the strength of the external rotators a little bit more they help the glenohumeral joint for the humerus to sit a little bit lower in with more room inside the socket so I can actually start to see improvement or mobility just by strengthening the right muscles instead of having that dealt to rotator cuff dominance and imbalance so we want to fix that too and then when it comes to the fact that we need to just have overall better posture anytime our shoulders are going to be rounded more because of all this dominant frontside work we can fix that so they sit backwards a little bit more because we strengthen the muscles on the back side and instantly you so guys trust me on this one high quality reps every single day with just a band you overloading to the point where you dead breaking down muscle tissue there not a high eccentric component here there it and it work on if you guys found this helpful make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below I always say here guys we want to look like an athlete you got to Train like an athlete athletes need to be overhead they need to be able to do things overhead without having to worry about their bodies be training them in the process start working on the things that a lot of other people don think that matters that much no telling is going to go a long way towards developing the entire complete physique and that athleanx.com guys all of our programs are available over there they to help you to not just look like an athlete but train like one of the process alright guys we again in just a few days leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know what else you want me to cover my best to do that for you in the days and weeks ahead alright guys

Everyday Morning Routine: Workout Optional!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES--j0LOtaQ	ATHLEAN - X	what athletenext.com i something to do every single morning promise if you do this it help you a lot you your posture you your grip strength you improve your abs you little bit of an indicator of where your cns is in terms of your training and when you might want to dial it back a little bit and we can do this all in two and a half minutes all right so the first thing i do when i roll up out of bed every day you guys know i this with you before i drink water i try to get at least 20 to 24 ounces of water in i at room temperature now so it for me to drink and it sets me off on the right foot right i think it very important you are dehydrated when you wake up there unless you of the night to drink water which a lot of us don dehydrated it here to make a habit of getting water in first thing of the day but then we kind of take this all-important stop here as i walk through the bathroom i have a pull-up bar that i hang here from my closet now what this does is it gives me a one-minute opportunity two times to get something really important done the first thing i do is i want to try to decompress my spine so what i do is i just grab the bar and then drop my pelvis right so my my toes can be in contact with the ground here i lightly though but when i do that and i drop my pelvis here i decompress that lumbar spine you can literally feel the pelvis drop okay and the weight of the pelvis drop which allows those spinal segments to decompress so it should allow you to feel a little bit looser and better through there but the second thing is posturally i here through my thoracic spine because that mid back area right is the area that we always sit hunched over throughout the whole day this is our chance to always get good extension every single day for at least a minute to start off the day and it cumulative effect that has the biggest impact when you do this and i try to even reach my head through here to reinforce as much extension as i can through that area okay and obviously just gripping the bar for a minute is going to have that cumulative effect of actually working our forearm and our grip strength now i indicated before how that could be a a sort of a sign an early sign of whether or not you might be doing too much frying yourself out with your training if your grip strength is not where it needs to be and you start to lose strength during these two one minute sessions it indicator that you might be kind of tiring out a little bit but next we want to go immediately as soon as we is we turn right around and now we turn this into a nav exercise and you really just have to hang now i mentioned before when i had my hernia one of the hardest things i could do to get myself back on track was actually just hang from a bar because one of the biggest things that your ads are responsible for what we do is you just hollow out in here and just hold now this time though for my arms instead of just dropping down i want to get a little bit of stability pull down through this shoulder blades so i get some scapular stability too which is another thing i think we kind of lose sight of developing those muscles in the back so i hold it so i holding with the purpose of decompressing one moment one minute of holding to actually work on the abs the cumulative effect knowing that the two one-minute holes are actually going to help us build our form strength and our and our forums in general and also have an indicator of where we might be with our training so it quick little routine and it do all you need is just that pull-up bar and to remember to start making some new habits that are good habits for the long term if you guys that sets you off on the right track to having really good habits to change your whole body around that what we do with the athletics program i literally lay it out step by step so you don habit you make this a lifestyle you start making huge huge changes in your body that meantime if you found this video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know just want me to cover it i the days and weeks ahead all right guys see you soon [Music] you	Success
Slumped Posture (NO) Bigger Biceps (YES!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-UGPeTN4g	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com if you shoulders you this video I know that it not only aesthetically looks bad but it going to set you up for a long term bad prognosis for you and your shoulder health you hurting yourself in the gym if you walking around and/or training with Forli rounded shoulders well who knew the biceps we you I curl done with a pair of dumbbells and a wall is going to help you to start getting rid of those Forli rounded shoulders improve your posture and the same time actually build some bigger biceps so what we this it with our own anatomy here guys if you look at the elbow when I hold my arm down at my side it doesn straight down my elbow actually goes down from here at the elbow joint and actually radiates or deviates out a little bit to this side out that way and that angle of the elbow and the reason why we call it carrying angle is because it assists us when we something at our sides instead of it being straight down on our sides wood everything we were carrying would rub up against our legs and interfere with our ability to walk and carry at the same time but because it deviates a little bit that way we something walk and not have it hit our legs and impede our ability to move that that when I actually curl up where dumbbell go it actually goes up and then that way a little bit more okay it falls out side of my shoulder okay what does that do to the shoulder itself it actually allowing us to get external rotation at the shoulder it component motion of being able to get an externally rotated shoulder as opposed to an internally rotated shoulder which is exactly what we have too much of when we have forward rounded shoulders beyond that if we actually contract the biceps fully we have supination and supination means we and then out which again feeds that even more the supination allows us to get more of an externally rotated position here in the shoulder if I were to take that one step further we know that the biceps actually flex the shoulder forward go that way so if I position elbow bent and my arm is up beyond that point more I externally rotating even more so if we know that the bicep in its actions feed external rotation as much as it does then why are we not taking advantage of that when we do our bicep training because we know it our arsenal for getting better posture so what we do is we actually use these dumbbells and an exercise I introduced in the past called the no-money curl but I new wrinkle for it to make sure that you thing is this if you think you it right you get it wrong you really doing the benefit that you that I so what you do is you back up into a wall okay it hold your elbows out to the side here like that alright now when you do the exercise and you curl up you gonna curl and try to hit the wall with the back side of that dumbbell okay so you back side of the wall what it looks like when you do it two times two arms at a time is this set here curl up and press down up touch down up touch touch what you have to drop the weights a little bit from what you here and coming up and I rotating you can see I chest I externally rotating strengthening the rotator cuff at the same time that I doing all the motions of the biceps so I fact is this guys if you understand how your muscles prefer to work together you would have noticed this already you would have realized that this is a great exercise to not just always banging away at regular curls or hammer curls or things that actually already internally rotate your arms this is one of those key opportunities to still train the muscle you in almost unnoticed that extra work that helps to help balance out that posture get rid of all this rounded shoulder craft and work towards getting long-term shoulder health at the same time because guys it doesn can to matter you want to train hard but you want to train smart and athlean-x is all about that regarding this rounded shoulders stuff guys I actually have another video where it addresses some of the tightness is that you develop from having rounded shoulders particularly in the pecs I link that in the description below this is what it looks like here but in the meantime if you that lays it all out step-by-step puts the science back in strength guys because all this stuff doesn our Anatomy is step in a certain way because it actually matters we work that into every program we have all over at athlean-x calm and found this video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know if what I to cover I for you in the days and weeks ahead alright guys see you soon [Music] you	Success
Do This for \"Stiff\" Shoulders (INSTANT RELIEF!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRnjj_8wSNs	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com so if you are looking to do a shoulder workout but your shoulders just don meaning you go to lift your arms up overhead and they that much they you point of time you usually probably have a warm-up that you do that will kind of counteract that a lot of times what people will do is they let they right kind of move it over to the side this way move it back this way just trying to get their arms up overhead and loosen up because it feels this like I said stiff that do what I something that lot more effectively right away because you that are trying to work here to get your arms up overhead why because what was really stiff is not likely your shoulder joint right what happens is the shoulder joint itself is a ball-and-socket and that thing moves pretty good unless you have a documented impingement in your shoulder already a ball of socket is going to move pretty freely but what is not going to move so freely it blades on the back of your body here that contribute heavily to your arm being able to go overhead we have a scapular humeral rhythm which means the humerus itself contributes a portion to getting up to the top but if your scapula doesn were to lock it in place then it would not get up to the top your honor would never get all the way fully overhead no matter how much mobility you had here in your arm and your shoulder joint itself you need to have your the ability of your shoulder blades to rotate as you lift your arm up to be able to get your arm all the way up and over your head freely what we probably is the freeness of that mobility of the shoulder blade why because postural ewwy we lock it up we sit with poor posture we sit down a good portion of the day our arms aren elevating they over our head so those muscles there tend to get short and tight and they restrict the motion of the shoulder blades but what we can do is we can use this ball and there reason why we want to use this position yourself first and foremost down on the ground so we down on the ground you take away any of the cheating that you never get when you leaning back trying to fake your arm up to the top we don kneel down here on the ground to take that out of the equation put your hand up on the ball and the focus here is to get a little bit on the bottom side of the ball and then get your elbow in front of your body here okay so the elbow is angled right here in front of your body it I elbow is back and we in front of the body here and I want to basically push through the wrist right about through here and by pushing through the wrist I little bit of an external rotation here active external rotation of my shoulder that is actually activating the muscles that run all over this shoulder blade here and help contribute to some of the stability why we get while we raise our arm up over our head realizing that it in a tug-of-war with the deltoids as we do it so as I push here and I raise up I go like this okay I have a very slight push but I have enough of a push through here maintaining that forward elbow as we do it I come to the top if I need to get a little bit lower I get a little bit lower on the ball as I get more mobility and I raise it up now what we of that right shoulder blade as I lift my arm up over my head so as I come down now as it goes up it way the bottom portion is gonna rotate out towards the side that way and up it because we muscles in the first place to let it help you now after you do about six or seven we switch it right to the front here in the middle we walk our hands up underneath elbows are obviously in the middle or in front of our body now we come down here and then we press up reach your head through just like you would have to do on a overhead press reach the head through again I through my wrists here six or seven there roll it down this side here up and press again working on pushing through the wrists my hands are kind of dead back here but the elbows in front the fingers aren just going through the wrist one more can I get an extra rotation here and what we just awakened the muscles that support the scapula but we muscles that help to stabilize once our arms are over our head which are the lower traps and we involve them as well so now when I go to lift my arms up over my head it from this position here so now if I were to go overhead press it feels a lot better than how I stayed here for three four five minutes trying to do this no activation from doing this the proper activation we use the ball so guys try that out no matter what it is that you always a way to warm yourself up but you have to do it properly we do that here with athlean-x I showing you this little technique here I guarantee it it a try if you found this helpful guys make sure you subscribe to our channel I make videos like this all the time obviously but in the meantime if you looking for a program that helps you to get a step-by-step approach to getting yourself ready and then to knock it out in the gym every single workout we have those all over at athleanx.com alright

How to Fix Tight Hips (WITHOUT STRETCHING!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEAc-Ds7zJw	ATHLEAN - X	what athletenext.com today i with me oh wait i got jessie with me and we we tight hips because a lot of times guys will say oh my hips are so tight or they tight and i can make sense because at no point yes your hip flexor should actually be activated in the descent of the squat actively pulling you down but it tightness they the bottom of a squat as a matter of fact they want to do is fix somebody like jesse who actually has some tightness on a squat go ahead and squat down he gets up and he feels tightness in through here what going to help you guys because we going to go through three stages number one we non-jesse actually raymond over here to look at skeletal factors and things that you can do right away to fix the tightness that you thing we have to do is you have to actually look inside the joint a little bit right around something we call the hip capsule a lot of times we don really address this it some mobility actions that we could do to try to get to the root of it and then if that doesn things that we tend to always overlook at the muscle level and it about stretching the muscles it what the activity of those muscles are and what the stability of those muscles are because if it going to be getting some compensations other places that these tight hips so when stretching is not working guys you got to look other places this video is going to help you to finally get to the root of it all right so obviously there things that could be causing that tightness and that restriction but we have to start somewhere trying to figure it out and the easiest place to do that is to just stay here right here on the ground and no you don this for you but the good news is you don just take your hip through three different ranges of motion here the first is how much flexion do you have right and you can do this yourself again by grabbing onto your knee and pulling up and for jesse he flexion you can get well past waistline and it doesn want to make sure it it some bounciness to it the next thing is you want to check internal rotation and even though the foot outward the hip is actually going into internal rotation you want to look and see how much rotation can you get here 30 or 45 degrees would be great and jesse you don easier you could do that yourself just to sort of test that then we have to go into external rotation in an external rotation here we and what i lower leg can kind of cross your waistline be parallel to your waistline run east and west and a lot of you find that you restrictions here right but if you find that you have this restriction really hard and feel and restriction and internal rotation significant and also combined with some of this flexion limitation here that would start to indicate to me you arthritic changes going on there or you labral tear or maybe even a bursitis if you have some pain and those are cases all instances where you want to go get checked out for something that needs a little bit more qualified medical attention there because that something you single video right but when we see the restrictions when they from what we find in this video more capsular restrictions things that you can do something about you find that the restrictions come in external rotation and that what we find here with jesse you can see that his external rotation on this side is nowhere near getting to waist line he parallel here to his waist he running east west he of external rotation so we need to try to figure out what is happening here we the easiest of changes because we know we could do some things just with his own posture and how he sets up for a squat to help alleviate that and create more room but that persists then you got to start looking deeper guys you got to start looking into the hip itself and the capsule which we then interestingly looking at the muscles but not just from stretching them out but how we actually can use the activation of those muscles or really the inactivation that that so i step i the skeleton all right guys so let start off anatomically here because it the easiest thing the thing that you can do just like this just by changing position but it helps to understand what hips when you go to squat we should know that one of the requirements is to get into hip flexion right that squat is you flexion you want to be at proper depth well the first thing you can do to help yourself is realize that to get into flexion you want to make sure that you have external rotation because it be easier to get deeper into flexion if you have external rotation of the hip and you can see that right here if i were to take my hips and internally rotate them like this and then try to go into flexion you can see that i actually get limited in how high can go we get bony stops here inside the acetabulum here the ball and socket of the hip that actually gets cleared substantially more when i externally rotate the hip and i can keep going all the way up here that get way down into a deep squat you have to externally rotate the hip to get there so you if you realize that and you set yourself up to do that so the easiest way to set yourself up is twofold number one you take a little bit of a wider stance right if you go narrow stance squat you some impingement in the hip here an inability to get past this bony block right here and you can literally see it getting stuck it here on the pelvis you know but if i take my leg out wider and now i go down in there i clearance here anatomically i better opportunity to get down but then i could also just turn my legs out a little bit it squatting we talk about all the time guys if you want to squat effectively improperly you do need to turn your your legs out and not just your feet your feet doesn anything because you could turn down here and get some rotation at the tibia that won it out keeping those knees over the toes that want to keep the whole leg out so that now when i go into that squat i rotation so if you problems let still feel you inside we got to go to the next part here and that what capsule at the head of the femur here in the in the acetabulum all right so if you tried to make those skeletal modifications where you open up your hips and you squat and you finding that you you can but you got the tightness well then what you would want to do is you got to start looking a little deeper right inside the joint and again when people start pressing here it can them and that socket joint and what they about there is the capsule right the surrounding ligaments and structures that kind of hold the hip joint together it straps and it kind of acts like this if this is the ball and socket if i have tight capsule over the top and you try to create movement come on jesse for some movement it the idea is that you freedom of motion in here but if i actually was able to use this the head of the of the femur here as a mobility tool to create more space by pushing into these areas of tightness so that i actually loosened it now all this freedom of motion is back we want to restore that we can do that we can actually do that very specifically here with jesse to try to restore that external rotation inflection that needed in a squat so what you do is you take a band you anchor it to something behind you and you step into it on the affected side which we know in this case is jesse anchors it up nice and high not too high careful high and then you put yourself with your foot up on a box now if we want to just go into flexion which a lot of people will have you do is they just have you kind of sink into it right and what the band is doing on that high hip position is creating a little bit of a distraction in the hip joint to allow for some of that mobility and to allow it to sort of push into that posterior capsule right the tight posterior capsule to allow more flexion that idea you tools to stretch out the capsule but we can do better than that because we know we need an external rotation anyway so we can combine them because they going to happen in a combined way in a squat so we actually dive down into flexion but we allow the hip to turn out because we know that external rotation is being able to do this to turn the foot in this direction right so the hip joint needs to go on external rotation so jesse in the flexion but he external rotation this way now you can feel that yeah all right it what we do is you got to make sure guys that your foot still stays flat on the ground because again if we were to go translate this over to a squat you don want to just let it roll it to roll when you still have to stay in contact with the ground so that roll would be bad you want to keep this down and work on that external rotation go ahead dive and open there you go at the same time you get the benefit of hitting them both together since that to need when you get over there now this is something you want to work on especially again if you that problem when you were doing the when you made the modifications of your stance but beyond that what we need to do is look another level right because there could be something muscular that going on but it may not just be about stretching it it could be more importantly about activating muscles that are far away from the area of your problems let me show you what that means all right so here actually get interesting because we start to talk about the muscles which is where most of us put all of our attention but it flexibility of the muscles and you do realize that there are a lot of muscles that cross the joint or at least impact the hip and it muscles that will impact the motion of the hip so we to dissect the function of every single muscle because that would take a real scientist to do that we don that all we want to do is look at overall motions so if we can your case in a lot of people watch if we can rotation in general what is probably restricted uh your internal rotators right the stuff that rotation so whatever causes internal rotation in the hip will be potentially impacted here now in your case if you have a limitation in motion of the hip what the the desire to go stretch it or stretch the internal rotators in this case is not really where i would start see i would start and see maybe there some kind of a restriction caused for a reason because the number one thing your body always wants to do is it wants to stabilize the spine your spine for good reason is its main focus because an injury to the spine can be life-changing so what we want to do is always have stability there well we know that the way the joints are set up in the body is that the knee is a stable joint the hip is supposed to be really really mobile right the ball and socket but the low back needs to be stable we alternate these stable and mobile joints well if the hip joint here is tight why would that be maybe there some instability where there should be stability right and the place that i look right away is the low back the low back is supposed to be stable the spine is supposed to be stable if the spine is not stable maybe there compensation going on here right so if we can wake up the muscles that that are supposed to be providing stability to the pelvis and the trunk then maybe the hip will say all right i can do my thing so what i would do for you is i have to put in you out put you through this move i your side here because again this is the tight hip so this is your tight hip i have you get in this position here and we want to say hey what potentially could be causing some of that internal like that tightness into internal rotation okay so i position here now i want you to provide perform a side bridge but when you perform the side bridge you drive through your adductors the muscles on the inside here to try to pull up yeah feel that right okay now all i looking for is just for you to hold that and awaken these muscles on the inside here that here for support now let too hard for you let a little bit bring this up you can bring this even like that now go ahead and push you feel it still here a little easier but it on the on the inside so if we can waken these muscles up right now go ahead and lay back on your back again and if i could take the test again and go into external rotation i bit better believe it or not i mean i actually you can see this i little bit before he was he had at least about a 30 degree lack here he that down a pretty good amount if all of your rotation deficit goes away then yeah you problem you tightening here this is trying to cause the stability that you somewhere else if you have the stability of your pelvis from the other places that are supposed to do it then you wouldn stability in your hip it be mobile right so when it gets more comfortable knowing that his job is free to do what it has to do it can actually restore the motion if this doesn it though there can do just to lay on your stomach this is where we look for just overall flat out weakness and i will say that you there as well so for jesse first thing we bring his leg up like we did like this and now first thing you want to do is you want to test your strength into rotation so if he lifts his foot off the ground but keeps his knee down what is his strength there how does it feel no that were to hold if you were to hold an hour press he actually could kind of resist me right there now that rotation strength to test his external rotation he of the ground i said lift his knee off of the ground try it see he can very high because he doesn strength there and i don do with one finger go ahead one finger i could push him back down again he lacking external rotation strength of his hip tremendously right and then the last thing i could do is i could have him try to lift the whole leg up see and as soon as he does he dives right down into internal rotation he has no strength in flexion lift it up again the whole leg inflection with external rotation he can i know he that address so things like hip minivan walks uh clam shells anything we can do to sort of strengthen the external rotators at the hip will be a good deal the bottom line here guys is that there lot of causes for what why you feel tightness the thing that not happening here is a tightness in the flexors of the hip when you go down into a squat your flexors are getting shortened right they they need to stretch them anymore what you need to do is you need to figure out why you modifications and how you stand don fix it you move to the next level if modifications and stretching out that capsule don the next level if the mobility or stability of this joint isn affecting what you do isn getting to the bottom of it by fixing that sort of inactivation of the muscles that are that are opposing what you trying to do you need to move to the next level if the weakness is there or let and you test out strong where jesse failed miserably you need to move to the next level guess what that next level is stretching the hip it comes last stretching the muscles of the hip are going to be the least impactful when it comes to getting to the real root of why you restriction when you get to the bottom of the squat so guys i hope you found this video helpful in the meantime if you the science back in strength because as you can see these things matter and there be doing at every step of the game you want to assess what it is after you made a change and then go from there not just keep doing the same things all the time expecting a different result and our programs are based on that if you head to athletics.com right now you can find the program that your goals in the meantime if you haven and turn your notifications so you never miss a video when we put one out and make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know so i can cover for you to try to help you guys in your training and take it to that next level all right guys be back here again soon see ya [Music] you	Success
Do This Stretch First Thing EVERY Morning (INSTANT RELIEF!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4-MLaa4nCs	ATHLEAN - X	What all like this, I the stretches, the tightness in the hip flexors,\\xa0\\nright, the back just does feel like you can move it or turn it at all. If that is you, then I\\xa0\\nhave the solution for you here. Because I to show you one thing-- and I know there morning, but this is the one thing if you have\\xa0\\nreally no time at all to drop down on the floor\\xa0\\xa0 and do because this is going to fix a lot of those\\xa0\\nissues that you so with that being said, got a new feature here.\\xa0\\nA lot of sports channels of the replays and\\xa0\\xa0 telestrations, well, we have something called the\\xa0\\ntelestriation. Don so what and every single person can do this. It\\xa0\\ndoesn what your ability level is. You can do this.\\xa0\\nAll right, and the thing is you got to first\\xa0\\xa0 think about what might be getting a little bit\\xa0\\ntight and screwed up when you sleep overnight.\\xa0\\xa0 Because you you got to undo some of that because we tend\\xa0\\nto get really stiff. Well, think about it,\\xa0\\xa0 if my arms are by my side like they probably are,\\xa0\\nwe that soft enough you will-- you also going to sink in a little bit too so they so they rotating. You might like to lay on your side, but\\xa0\\nyou from the top to get actual rotation through the\\xa0\\nthoracic spine so you can get tight there too.\\xa0\\xa0 So we can fix all these things and this is what it\\xa0\\nis. The exercise is the bridge reach-over. Okay,\\xa0\\xa0 so now, what is so great about this? Well, this\\xa0\\nis where we want to start breaking down piece\\xa0\\xa0 by piece. And this is where I say, Hey, boom,\\xa0\\nright there, and I freeze it. And now I have the\\xa0\\xa0 opportunity to break out my telestriation.\\xa0\\nHey, hey, hey, that it is Jesse I does is it enforces this glute activation. And not\\xa0\\njust that, because we have the knees bent here,\\xa0\\xa0 we get hamstring and glute coactivation, which\\xa0\\nis how they always prefer to work. People tend\\xa0\\xa0 to let the hamstrings dominate, they don leads to an overload on the hamstrings and a lot\\xa0\\nof hamstring strain. So at least you this to work in the way it prefers to work. But\\xa0\\nbeyond that, look at the hip extension I get. I\\xa0\\xa0 actually get even a little bit of a bow at the\\xa0\\ntop because I And a lot of times we don just a little bit of flection at night we need\\xa0\\nto get through that to feel like we rid of that tightness. So we have activation\\xa0\\nhere in the glutes. But beyond that, what happening here with the lats? The lats are getting\\xa0\\nstretched out in that direction. Arm up overhead,\\xa0\\xa0 right? Attached to the top of the humerus here,\\xa0\\nseparated from the hip itself. These two points\\xa0\\xa0 getting further and further apart from each other\\xa0\\nhere like that. And now we have some stretch on\\xa0\\xa0 the lat so that second problem is done. And then\\xa0\\nwhen we look here, this is the key for me. We get\\xa0\\xa0 thoracic extension and we get the rotation in this\\xa0\\ndirection. So if I clear that off, we can see it a\\xa0\\xa0 little bit better. Again, extension and rotation\\xa0\\nbecause I got to reach to the opposite side. So\\xa0\\xa0 in one move we because we know that we don It stays in alignment with the hips. We it should come from, which is the thoracic spine.\\xa0\\nSo again, you alternate here. If we go back and\\xa0\\xa0 take a look at what it looks like, one side to the\\xa0\\nother like that, each time drive it up as high as\\xa0\\xa0 you can, push through the right leg to reach over\\xa0\\nto the opposite side, push through the left leg to\\xa0\\xa0 reach over to this side. An amazing exercise that,\\xa0\\nagain, any person can do. Drop down on the floor\\xa0\\xa0 in the morning, do five to each side, maybe do it\\xa0\\ntwice, you guys, a quick stretch that you can do every\\xa0\\nsingle morning that of the things that are happening when you sleep\\xa0\\nto make you feel a hell of a lot better and get\\xa0\\xa0 you off on your day in the right direction. Guys,\\xa0\\nremember, if you build all of these things into everything we do\\xa0\\nbecause it all matters. How you feel not just\\xa0\\xa0 during your workout but after your workout may\\xa0\\nbe even more important. All of our programs are\\xa0\\xa0 available over at Athleanx.com. If you found the\\xa0\\nvideo helpful, if you like the new telestriation\\xa0\\xa0 feature-- Jesse videos of them. If you haven you never miss a new video when we put one out.\\xa0\\nAll right, guys, see you soon. Telestriation.	Success

I get back from vacation or when the kids go back to school or when my friend decides to work out with me everybody got or next Monday at least that of the week but it and people always want to push the date further and further back because they know that changes are coming and they don they know they need to they see it in the mirror every single day they re they re uh they they reconvince themselves every single morning when they look in the mirror and go I got to do something about myself I there to make them say I day today and my job as a coach is to make sure that your day is today the the crazy thing is if you think about what it is that gets people to move and act on something it usually some form of of a this pleasing event will cause you to really want to change and do it right away if you were to step on a nail and you had that nail sticking in your foot do you think you would say ah that really sucks but I take it out tomorrow we can wait no you right away and out right away or if you had a rabbit amimal running around your house cuz you left the door open would you say that for the night we tomorrow you be getting him out of there right away so why is it that when someone sees themselves and hates what they see because it happens all the time guys I get emails really heartfelt serious deep de deep reaching emails guys looking ins inside themselves and being honest and saying I can what division one athlete and now I can move or I used to look so good that I had everybody you know asking me what I did to work out and I thinking that I ever worked out things that really hurt but meanwhile despite despite the fact that they hurt there always some reason why we push them off and I to be that way if you guys make this a dedication to changing your lifestyle you click and you got to start right now there is no better time than starting right now forget New Year this guys seriously I mean I I like well actually I don Year holiday season I don particular because I do I feel that people wait too long and they put so much emphasis on that day and those two weeks cuz we know that 3 weeks later January 21st 85% of the people that started the resolutions on January 1st have given up on them they on them they stimulus of January 1st that happy New Year is gone if you have to write it on your calendar every damn day if that out then start saying it now and use it every single day for the rest of the year I don need but you got to start doing something and don do this don failure by creating these our own barriers people are renowned for doing that they will create their own obstacles so that they know they so they have a reason for why they fail don away oh you know I can man it going to make it to the gym great you probably not

I do that in our athlet system I try to be your literal workout partner I try to tell you and coach you through every workout I don obstacles so oh I can follow that type of eating plan because I don don one of the many zillions of protein options that we have that don if you vegan or vegetarian options just don eat what you don foods you don to just really restricted diet of foods that you don that you that if you don really dedicate to changing your life and you wind up falling off that path you could easily say that why I fell off the path no that was an excuse and that was a self-made obstacle that you put up in the first place so that being said Happy New Year no seriously I really mean it happy New Year this is going to be your best year ever and if it needs to start right now then it think it should I don ever be procrastinating and pushing back what we can do tomorrow that we can do today especially since you you able to have this day to be able to make that change so go

Six Pack Abs (WHY YOUÂLL NEVER HAVE THEM!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7qBhMKvIiQ	ATHLEAN - X	what so am I talking to you that title I know you may not be talking to you you see if you and hard work only and actually having a respect for nutrition and what you put in your mouth and the fact that you are what you eat that I because you already know that that way that you get a six pack that you get abs abs are your visible badge of honor because you them the guys I guys that unfortunately have been LED down this path to believe that there are some magical formulas or shortcuts to getting abs and unfortunately guys we know where they all come from I feel bad for those that feel that way though because what they left disappointed and angry so how did this all start I did a video actually just yesterday for you on how to eat when you you fitness goals you you Temptations of poor eating when you out on the road and away from the Comforts of your own home one of the guys that commented on it and I just thought it was so great because I it comment it individual comment was okay so you basically told us that when we road to try to prepare ourselves and bring things that will will actually help us to be prepared and secondly look for healthy food options when we the road to summarize you right that do but guess what he told me to [\\xa0__\\xa0] off he me to [\\xa0__\\xa0] off in my life too that fine but he told me to [\\xa0__\\xa0] off because he was aggravated and angry because he said I what find what you leprechaun when you searching for that too give me tell me how that goes because there is nothing else the guys that are looking for secret formulas and have been conditioned to think that you can get a six-pack while you sleep and all that other [\\xa0__\\xa0] it down this road to frustration the sooner that you can direct your energies away from the search for what doesn and towards the facts that actually do and start applying that work towards your actual workouts and towards cleaning up your own nutrition and having a respect for what you eat then going to be much happier because you be that much closer to actually getting what it is you first place in this case it six-pack you know it can actually is required to get something done because we the thing that doesn of times guys want that thing to be elusive if it easy excuse for why you don why you can never grasp it because it too hard to obtain this is not hard to obtain but it takes dedication and it takes willpower and it takes a commitment to prioritize your Fitness over the other indulgences that lead you away from your goal for me as I said in that video working out and how I eat is part of what I do it but beyond that it it is my priority it it than I value some of the other things that other guys value does it make me better than anybody else hell no not at all not at all it priorities it someone else might value but telling me that discrediting what I saying that guys here watching what you eat and eating healthy foods and there choose from there choose from and our own athlete xfactor meal plan we you you Rabbit Hole of how to eat there many ways you can do it but it healthy it that approach you results but there there that that some magical trick that he has to go look in another video for because it doesn someone that tells you that guess what you just found the biggest bullshitter that you ever find because they bullshitting you to make you think that you found the secret and and this new way of eating and eating Doritos and Cheetos and hogen do and all that stuff is the best way to get a sixpack anybody that tells you that they and I can tell you they out for your best interest and they not giving you the right advice because that is not a long-term sustainable plan that is not how your body prefers to sustain itself and fuel itself that is not the answer the answer is unfortunately sometimes the boring answer but I answer that will work in the long term and have the most sustainability and and in this case when we nutrition we game we sustain something and eat a certain way forever it sacrifice yes the good is still riging to all this you might be the guy right now that will never have abs why because you do believe in all that nonsense but it doesn you believe what I you believe that there are some sacrifices that have to be made if you believe that hard work is required you can change your way you think if you believing in all those shortcuts stop it especially because you find yourself going from bouncing from video to video to video angry angry and angrier because the stuff that you tried didn slept all night you didn did all the things they told you to do you didn it up if you keep doing what you doing you you you can change your mentality and it can start right here with this video so most of my guys I know that watch they dedicated to hard work they commitment to to Fitness and a lifestyle of living a healthy lifestyle right we know that if you guys are there you guys are my subscribers and I get it the guys here are just pastors and passers by and stopping in for a video or so maybe I can change you the way you think a little bit and if I hope that my no BS approach doesn weren because it doesn more non-bs type approach to what we do then subscribe to the channel or even more so head over to athlet next.com and get our training system if you don want to buy a training system there many freaking videos here on this channel that describe our approach and will help you along that way you forced to buy anything I have but for God rainbow screw the leprechaun he doesn exist and let you want abs you earn them all right guys we here again soon sorry another Jeff rant video but sometimes we need to do it if you want to know uh see anything else on this channel make sure you leave your comments below and I my damnest and best to bring you guys what you want to see all right I back here

5 Huge Workout Cheats (WHY YOU CANÂT BUILD MUSCLE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSUkc8brwU8	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com would you get pissed if I called you a cheater now don we all are to some degree see if you working out and you you you I made a point a couple weeks ago in a video we did on ab training it specifically how our hip flexors take over for our abs where I said one comment that our bodies are masters of compensation and I think it might have blown by that too quickly see that the fact of the matter is our bodies are so damn smart and in order to get them to respond to our training we have to force them to not be so efficient with what we to make our workouts inefficient from a standpoint of we can tell us the movement patterns they want to move in because guess what they cheat they strengths deficits they single move we do easier so what I wanted to do is just showcase a few of them to show you just how our bodies take over and make exercises that should be done one way make us do them completely different at the same time they robbed us of the results that we should be seeing while doing them so right away if you shoulder training you can pretty much guarantee that unless you examining how you doing each rep you probably cheat on those reps and I can tell you you yourself some shoulder size in the process first of all I call it the traps trap when we raise what likely happens here what we know you can always analyze this part of the exercise you that work that that dumbbell from somewhere down at your side to out at your side because you know that the exercise is executed but we don know how we get there what muscles are helping us do it and a lot of times anything that muscle you contribute in this case the traps take over to a large degree the traps trap is that while I dumbbell up I let my traps shrug and help pull up you can see that just by shrugging I higher but it delt now I throughout how to do the exercise so we don is one that the long run so what we try to do is let the arm stay I demonstrated this in previous video stay below and almost like it reach up and under the fence if you do that you this side try to keep the trap out of it and reach up and out you can still bend a little bit of the arm but that is even a little bit of a cheat I because you have to adapt by allowing for a little bit heavier weight if you do that because you shortening your movement arm here okay so but if you straight out then obviously now you got more gravity here pushing down in your arm that weight becomes essentially heavier okay so that next is another area on the shoulders the front delts and we before too if we shoulder raise right here out in front of us we know what dumbbell from here up to here okay somewhere in front of our body here but guess what we can do that if we having troubles because we don strong enough front of the shoulder we can do that by bringing about that far up and then doing that with our back and guess what now I got to parallel but then I get there with the muscles that we want it to work you do the job no so we were getting our lumbar spine to say hey I just worry about getting the momentum started so get a little bit of momentum and then I extension but yet again not what we looking for if we our shoulders we the shoulders only guys this is literally going to happen on every single exercise unless you consciously worrying about how you doing the exercise and focusing on doing it right because the body wants to take over so even on triceps how many of you seen guys do their tricep pushdowns like this they lean over the top and they do that well again naturally your body going to want to do this why is that versus maybe staying up right here and doing your tricep pushdowns here first of all your elbow will travel in a longer elbow joint we a longer movement arc here and yet more distance travel that you weights gonna be more work for your your triceps to do that if we hover over the top of it and start from here our travel is much shorter we of motion but that on top of that when we get in this position we exaggerated almost like a dip like a really close instead of having our arms here we got our arms in here and we getting our chest to contribute to this tricep pushdown so we down yeah those guys can load up the weight stack because you much more than just their triceps to do that so is the cheating effective if you want to look like you more weight but for me that necessarily the end game here the end game is to get you looking in performing better by generally building the accurate strength in your triceps so yeah even back to again every single muscle group ain on a typical one-arm row what do you see you see guys maybe start off with good intentions of lifting the dumbbell straight up straight down getting our elbow up as high as they can back behind their body but the weight starts to get heavy so our body says whoa I can this alone I need some help and the only way I can do that is if I start rotating my body if I rotate off of this arm then I know that I feel like the dumbbells traveling further but I could have stopped here okay stop here and then rotate and I feel like the dumbbell just went up another six inches but it did nothing because we didn our body any further so we get it to here and we rotating and you see guys do rows like that instead of keeping flat keeping their shoulders Square to the bench that would be your visual key if I could keep my shoulders square up to the bench and then pull back to my elbow then I can ensure that all the work is being done by my back okay obviously the bicep instead of allowing this shoulder to open up okay we down arm another cheating is rampant is here at the pull-up bar why because again we we know what the goal of pull-up is so simple we got to get our body up to the bar but it it bar getting our chin over the top of the bar and it chin to the bar so we will see as people that will approach the pull-up bar and they their lats won they reach as far as they can go and they come up and reach at the top it up and we a good rep okay if you want to do these what you want to do is you want to actually make sure that you engage the last first so you know the secondary cheat is actually trying to pull down with your forearms that thing you into it to get you body up but instead you should really be just getting a thumbless grip hook your hands on the bar take the forearms out of it and then try to initiate here through the back down by pulling with the elbows from there always keep your head straight forward if you keep your eyes straight forward once your eyes cross the level of the bar you up there because your chin is obviously lower than your eyes so if your eyes go up there the chin will be right at the bar so if we go here and we lock in the elbows pull down up to the top once my chin and my eyes are over the bar my chin is at the level of the bar we good okay here and down cross the bar with my vision so there you have it guys in just a few examples of how we become masters of compensation and overcome even our weakest link if we let our bodies do that remember our bodies are much smarter than we ever give them credit for and they then us because we can always know what we our bodies will always know the easiest way out and if you think that this is limited to the newbies the guys in the gym for the first time no it gets worse when we talk about professional athletes why because professional athletes are so athletic they have such innate athletic abilities that oftentimes they their own weaknesses and as a strength coach it out of them and figure out where they compensating because again they compensating too they everybody else but that talking about overcoming strength weaknesses it gets worse when we start talking about overcoming injuries and things that we take into the weight room with us because the same thing will happen there one joint Hershiser you going to find a way to shift it to somewhere else and that looking for guys if you want to start training with a complete program that gets you from not just point A to point B we talk about it all the time it about getting you from A to B the right way using the right muscles at the right time in the right sequence that guy athlean-x is what we what you should be using because this is how athletes train this is how we train like athletes and you can do that guys go ahead and flex calm right now and getting our athleanx training system in the meantime if you do these things yourself and guys I guilty of every single one of those or I wouldn if you me know in the comments below what is that you struggle the most with I might be able to give you a tip like I did with some of the exercises here to help you overcome some of those popular cheats in the meantime if you found this one helpful let me know below and I will make more videos for sure in the coming days whatever else it is that you to see or you thanks guys you	Success
Arnold Schwarzenegger Workout Tips (5 THINGS I LEARNED!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6ubG5fZhIk	ATHLEAN - X	what very few people are recognizable by their first names only but if I say the name Arnold you and I pretty much know exactly who I Schwarzenegger I got a gift for Christmas the other day and I didn recognize it at first but I should have just by how heavy this thing was I didn and gray cover but this is a reprint an update of the modern Encyclopedia of bodybuilding Arnold Schwarzenegger Bible of bodybuilding pretty much a 796 page book that I actually already own two copies of I own the one that you guys probably many of you watching would relate to that yellowish color right you could probably see it I have two copies already on my shelves one that my brother had and one that I had and when my brother moved I took it from him so I have three copies now officially of this book but it brought to mind sort of brought me back to my day of why I was so inspired by him in the first place Arnold was the Action Hero of the Day along with Sylvester Stallone both of which inspired me to take what was a hobby at that time into a lifelong passion and now a career and I wanted to sort of pay homage to him in the form of a video where I showcase five of the things I specifically learned from Arnold that I now apply Even in our athlete X training now that being said I think it that Arnold and I obviously don on everything during his pursuit of his Mr Olympia titles it documented that he himself has admitted he used anabolic steroids in that Pursuit now it it was a time when people didn anabolic steroids as they do now so I think having channels like this we can actually educate you towards what those are and steer you down alternative paths that will allow you to still make impressive gains and really change your physique but to do so in a much healthier way secondly there are obviously exercises in this bodybuilding Bible Andy opedia that I don necessarily think of the best exercises you can do I videos about five of the worst exercises I think you can do which I you up here that yeah they appear in that encyclopedia does that mean that they effective exercises no but guys my responsibility as a professional athlete strength coach and physical therapist is to choose exercises based on a risk reward ratio that help you to get the results we can they that we get them by get staying safe and healthy at the same time because the athletes careers depend upon those decisions and again lots of you guys out there have experienced injuries from those same five exercises that I show you in that video and Arnold himself with his very favorite flies exercise did an interview in 1977 where he talked about tearing his Peck twice while doing flies so we have to take all that in consideration and finally he was his his training workouts were legendary 2 hours 3 hours 4 hours at a time he could go and do that a day and then come back back the next day and come back the next day but again you got to look back to the first point when training with anabolic steroid usage you be able to do some crazy amazing things like that because your recovery is going to be greatly enhanced but that what we make sure that we we we that being said there Arnold and I do agree on and starts right there with his training intensity very few people train with the intensity of Arnold Schwarzenegger all you have to do is look at just a few of his training footage or Clips or still photos and I guarantee you that every single one of them if he is mid set has got him gritting his teeth because this guy pushed it every single time matter of fact it was legendary his back and forth that he would have with his training Partners to push for just a single additional repetition now why did he do that because he knew that you don get results you have to force change you have to force results and I got to tell you guys if you show up to the gym thinking that you results just because you get there that not what Arnold would canone it certainly not what we canone here with athlet X I tell you all the time if you in to get the change that you need to get out of your workouts and I you anybody can show up to the gym if they got a few bucks worth of gas and they have a gym membership but that doesn Arnold Schwarzenegger if you bring the intensity that you need to your workouts you will start to change your body I guarantee you and if you have to look to somebody for inspiration see if he can dig up some old clips of this guy training that should be more than enough incentive to change how hard you training the second thing related to the first one which was intensity is a technique that Arnold used that was certainly intense the one day cure he would head up into the mountains with his buddies Take Along one piece of equipment select one exercise and do that thing over and over and over again and that would be his entire workout what do I believe in this I believe that you can absolutely do that you can take a single exercise and make it into a workout how do you do it with intensity again maybe you got to adjust those hours that Arnold had because we don train under the same influence he did however however if you have the intent and the intensity in your workout then you can take an exercise and make it into a workout so much so in one of our entire phases of NXT we have our slash and burn training we devote a single exercise as the only exercise to that workout you can get the results guys you can always get results if you choose an exercise concentrate on getting that that movement from point A to point B using the muscles that you to be using in the movement don try to move a bar or try to get from point A to point B thinking that that the goal it there using the muscles that you were intending to use in the first place Arnold knew this he practiced this he lived this and we do too number three is showcasing the actual yin and yang of Arnold Schwarzenegger just how complete he was when he approached his training was the fact that he also believed in shocking the muscle and not doing the same thing over and over again in applying a variety of high-intensity techniques from running the rack to drop sets to negative only sets to forced reps so many different techniques why because he truly realized that in order to change your body you have to challenge yourself at all aspects and you have to do so in a way that your body is not comfortable guys if there this principle is that your workout should never feel comfortable if if you want to at least Garner a change from them if you want to Garner a change you have to challenge yourself your workout should be very inefficient I know there today who believe that the goal is to become very efficient in what you do but not if you not if you better version of yourself a stronger version of yourself you have to realize that all these methods and techniques make your muscles uncomfortable and unaware of what even as a a trainer to athletes we can predict everything that happen on the field the moment you think that you specifically for what on the field is the moment you become a bad trainer because when they get out on the field something unpredictable happens always and if they training in the waight room to handle and be prepared for that unpredictability then they be doing themselves a disservice so if anything make sure that you a lot of different techniques we implied hundreds of techniques throughout all of our athentic training programs that keep you guessing that that keep your muscles on their toes so that they to what you fact they are forcing themselves to change to adapt to what you doing number four and one of those specific techniques that I didn mention last time his 21s now we know he 21s to curls and what the 21s are if you the lower range or the lower half of the range of motion on a curl he performs seven reps down from the low point to the halfway point from the halfway point he would then perform seven reps from here and up obviously having to stop at the hardest range of motion and then come back up seven reps that way but before he put the bar down he then go and do full Reps for seven more so you get seven seven and seven there his 21 one of the best techniques that I use again from the time I was a small guy a small kid trying to become arold foregger till now and not only that but we employ that technique with lots more than just curls matter of fact in athl X we apply it to ab exercises there of ways that you can take ab exercises divide the range of motion up into that lower half top half and of course the full range and get tremendous results from it and last but not least one thing we can all learn from Arnold Schwarzenegger is the fact that when it comes to training he never made excuses and he never let anybody stand in the way between him and his goals he had a determination unlike any other you look at it this is a guy who came to this country not speaking English who went on to become the governor of California this is someone who proclaimed to us all that he was going to be the next big action star got laughed at and then became the next big action star so you think about it are there people who told you you can now beginning of January you resolution and people say hey you going to stick to it or they try to drag it down because it makes them feel better about themselves that they already given up don anything let our own inspire you to do something different this year set a goal and stick to it don know them all I I guys I all I have enough training equipment at home to work out didn or couldn wasn certain exercise you work within your limitations and then you figure out a way to get it done we all might have some limitations we all might have some inconveniences but there to get it done and Arnold Schwarzenegger always found a way to get it done and as I said if there try to deter deter you from your own determination to reaching your goals then you got to figure out a way to get around them too because nothing can stop you from achieving what you want to achieve if you set your mind to it and that is one big thing that I learned from arold Schwarzenegger for sure guys if you found this video helpful if you like Arnold Schwarzenegger obviously as much as I did if you grew up whether or not you even own the book okay cuz I know a lot of you guys out there do the fact is you can learn something from anybody you can be in inspired by anybody you don everything they say but you can be inspired by somebody to do things and change the way that you do things and I certainly was here leave your comments below let me know what inspires you and lastly if you program that not only reflects the influences I had in my development in my career but has now taken them to the next level put the science back in strength then guys that training system you can find it over at athlet x.com in the meantime if you found this video helpful leave a thumbs up and tell us whatever it else is that you want to see and I that video in the coming weeks see you soon guys	Success
Why Your Workout Plan isnÂt Working (HARSH TRUTH!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2KbkJIEWZg	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what today I your face talk manto man give you the truth cuz you know that if there place you can come I hope you know that by now you can come right here on this channel cuz I am not going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] you I I know it the long run and today I want to talk to you about results and you can take a look at that thumbnail and you going see two pictures on there both of me and say well there I can bigger I tell you I here even in this past year I stronger I muscular something you to do at the age of 40 at least people will tell you that guys don you but it trying to show what I is that those two pictures were actually taken 365 days apart almost to the day and to me that lot of people watching this video right now they are already know that if you a regular viewer of this channel that wasn 342 days ago and 310 days ago and 289 days ago and any day you want to pick that was me I don throughout the year I practice what I preach and I preach to you what I know on this channel because I can get you into that same place and a lot of guys would kill to have that level of consistency and be able to be there and I can tell you what when you get locked in it really truly is because it becomes a lifestyle you following and chasing leprechauns as I say looking for the latest T trick and tactic and and uh shortcut and all that [\\xa0__\\xa0] you are down the path to consistency because you the problem and I can tell you right now I know why I know why a lot of guys can even if you regularly even if you workouts and you really congratulate you because guess what there YouTube that will watch it and never do a damn thing with it and everybody who who know they about that but you got to do something about it it about it but you got to change your you know change your habits and start doing something about it but even the guys that are consistently going and doing the workouts there and there that you might be overlooking and that is the fact that even if you let other thing that maybe you overlooking and that is the most important what are you doing in the other 23 hours of that day 23 hours that 23 hours becomes 46 over two days and 46 becomes 69 right that and if you add that up over the year there serious damage if you about what you 23 hours or focusing on them and we all slip up there and I about nutrition there are a lot of things that you can do a lot of styles of eating diet plans uh uh different things that you can do with how you manipulate your intake of food that can help you to start losing weight right now you know it you probably tried a bunch of them but if you do that for 23 hours and maybe you can stream together two days maybe you can stram together two weeks maybe you can string together two months can you do two years can you do six years can you do 20 years if you can because it to where you need to be and where you could be and that is living at a level of consistency living there it lifestyle it it do my work it so it consider I recently had twin boys some people here on on YouTube were projecting my Doom never will he be able to be in shape ever again you know as a father with with uh with responsibilities to his kids and his wife and his family he very very soon guess what guys it ain going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] happen you know why because it of my life I wouldn didn I don don something to make sure even if it training it eating well to stay on that path to consistency so you have to start realizing that that amount of time is going to take another level of commitment you can commit yourself to getting yourself to the gym as I said that is a that is a noble thing the fact that you can do that I personally am very proud of the fact that you can get yourself to the gym and regularly get your work done but there to that commitment that you got to ratchet it up and it requires paying attention to those other 23 hours and you know right now look at me right here you know that if you results that you think you deserve because you do regularly show at the gym guess what you probably not doing all that well in those other 23 hours you you you that hold you back but if you can find a plan whatever it is that works for you I talk all the time every single video I talk about athletex and our athletex training system and how simple it is and how simplified I exact same way that I eat the exact same way and it allows me to stay here every single day 365 days a year and do my videos and practice what I preach to you I don give you [\\xa0__\\xa0] that I that I don and practice myself I give you the same advice the same steps the same Simplicity and I build it in but it doesn want to follow the Athletics training system or the way our athl extraor meal plans and how we eat fine find what works for you but you better have one thing and don not true your thing better work for a lifetime because that is the only thing that happiness and being able to stay locked in on your goals instead of feeling those ups and downs where half the year you want to hide yourself behind clothes and half the year you it off and I know what time it is I know and I this time of year when people start wanting to show off a little bit so they stuff that they last few months how bad you never screwed up in the first place and how bad if you enjoyed it every step of the way and we accomplishments that you have by maintaining that all year it better feeling guys it feeling than having to feel like you doing this all the time so what I begging of you is to continue to do your workouts continue to show up while the lazy asses sit around and do nothing you be proud of yourself for doing what you another level now let about the other 23 hours because they matter and they matter a lot and as you can see when you compare them to the time that you spend training and in the gym it there all this extra time can do a lot to undo this little time that you spend training and I want to make sure that you guys can focus on something again I don doesn for you but make sure it works for a lifetime if you guys found this to be a little bit of a wakeup call then good but most of all I want you to know that you can get there you can do this guys again I stand up here 365 days a year making sure that I can I can practice what I preach people say Jeff why do you do your video with your shirt off because I want to prove to you guys I not a phony I know what it takes I know how to make it work and I know how to make it simple and I say all the time as I said at aex.com in our athletex training system the program that I designed the program that I live the program that I breathe it works and it works for a lifetime and I able to have all you guys be able to find that same level of consistency but it doesn program okay you can find whatever works for you I just want to see you get to that point that you are happy with where you victory guys I soon make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know what you want to see on this channel here this is your channel I and make the videos that you need and if I need to give you that little kick in the ass when needed then so be it at least as I said in the beginning it truthful I	Success

Workout Motivation (HIT HATERS WHERE IT HURTS!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rEumOahfds	ATHLEAN - X	you can chance you can you for you you wasting your [Music] time have you ever heard any of those things before maybe a lot of them I tell you this the way you handle it and your reaction to them can either be the most crippling thing that you heard or could be the most motivating today I want to talk to you guys about how I handle situations like this and how I it starts with actually setting the stage with a comment that I got in a a video that I did last week I read that to you here we person you irrelevant the comment itself said this I Natty guy that years now I go hard 6 days per week and I eat clean with good genetics I look nothing like je he started taking trt and now I look like him he steroids to make his body his selling point real people can and this is in capital letters never ever never ever look like him I do have some good news though see your doctor and get a full blood panel if you and have lower than average tea levels a good doctor will start you on a trt program for about 200 bucks per month that I promise you no time that right there guys that pisses me off and not for the reasons that you might think it would you see being accused of being on steroids to a guy that is natural is probably the greatest compliment that you can ever receive in your life as late as college guys I was self-conscious enough to actually pick times during the day that I would know that I would avoid the most people in the gym I weirdest hours in the day just so I wouldn and feel self-conscious or most more self-conscious than I did about how skinny I was or about how weak I might be but you see I didn stopped trying I had guys that I tried to mirror myself after I grew up in the 80s and 90s Stallone Ravishing Rick Roode if for guys out there used to watch wrestling Arnold Schwarzenegger yeah they were clearly way the hell bigger than I was but you know what I didn stop me if I had to work out at home I worked out at home if I had to pick those OD hours I pick those odd hours but you know what I never ever said never ever see cuz when someone starts saying Jeff you can can can do this or just give up or quit or whatever they want to tell me all that ever did to me is motivate me to work harder and I can tell you I know a lot of people unfortunately that hear those words that quit if you felt like quitting let me be that example for you let me be the guy that tells you you don harder every single day there it ain guy in his trt therapy I can tell you one thing he of a lot of money because if he wanted to he could have gotten a lot farther spending a lot less with the athletex program every month than he could have with all his wasted money on his trt therapy and I can tell you right now anybody that says I eat clean that first sign that they don worst term you you your reasons of not being as lean as you should be the clean eaters are usually the worst eaters but I can tell you this guys I live a rigid lifestyle I don don drug in my entire life I steroids I to have frozen yogurt every single night I actually do with whipped cream on top but you know what I do the rest of the time I work my ass off I follow a very uh strict nutrition plan and by that I mean I eat healthy guys I eat healthy all the time I enjoy healthy foods and I feel like my body as I said I get one body in this life and I treat it with respect that as much respect as I can and I try to fuel it as if it machine because I told you guys in previous videos I don average average guys don average average guys will do the things that average guys do I never wanted to be average so I don average guy does now does that mean that you can mine absolutely you kid I see guys do it all the time I used to see it every day in Major League Baseball guys could drink and they could still have great bodies they make their balance their Bal they do their own Balancing Act maybe they don ice cream and they have their alcohol once or twice a week but they do it and they balance off the rest and they train just as hard in the gym and they work their asses off every other aspect of their life you can do that you can find your areas that you want to sort of uh stray off course a little bit and then of course have the discipline to get back on it but guys like this that want to make you believe that you can achieve something the guys that never achieve something they tell you you can know why the guys that do achieve something they know it possible I know it possible and every time I put a video up here on this channel for you guys to follow is because I know that if you follow the advice on giving you you will see results from what I and we have so many guys out there that have relied on the advice on this channel alone and have changed their physiques just the advice here we have a lot more people who up my advice on a dayby day training program nutrition program using the athletex program who phenomenal results by doing that they stayed dedicated they commitment to a lifestyle and that what these jackasses guys that want to tell you it themselves haven they haven haven up those are the guys though that are going to be telling you all the things that you heard in the beginning of this video you can now you know what he results he wants to because he quitter don don excuses get the job done I guys you can do it you got to start looking at that as motivation and then letting everything else fall in place and as I said as a guy who a damn thing in his entire life like I said I live probably the most boring life of anybody out there watching it just goes to show you how inspiring it can be to know that you can reach those levels that people will feel that way about you and you nothing but Blood Sweat and Tears and hard work and I same exact thing to you guys CU as I always say I would never recommend anything to you guys that I don or or uh Implement myself in my everyday training in life so hopefully guys this video another one of those kind of peak behind the scenes videos will be inspiring to you it will get you off your ass if you to sit around and lament what happening and if you are the guy who never listened to these guys anyway it further proof that you your time and you listening to only one person and answering to only one person and that yourself all right guys if you found this video helpful make sure you leave a comment thumbs up below whatever it is that gets

HOME WORKOUT MOTIVATION (Secret to Workout Consistency!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5Ru6mEs7Eo	ATHLEAN - X	are you working out at home and need some motivation to actually do it I think this video might help you I going to share with you my personal story of how I actually got started and got into the routine of health and [Music] fitness sup guys Jeff Cavalier aex.com probably the closest you your face here on my videos uh ever um but I want to switch it up today and do something a little bit different um a friend of mine Ralph uh who sort of always sort of tends to get me and try to drill down to the the core of um my fitness inspiration you know he always asked me what is it that got you started uh because he actually told me today he reminded me of a conversation where um I hated Fitness I hated working out I told him that um and there was something that happened that made me all of a sudden want to do this for a living right and do this for my life um and he wanted to know what is it that it was that did this for you that made that switch and I thought you know I could identify that and if I could identify that I might be able to identify that for you now I think it helpful for those guys that are working out at home all right especially the guys even that bounced back and forth to the gym and to home because finding the inspiration to work out even at home could be really hard uh let alone to actually get yourself to the gym especially here in the Northeast where it creating an environment that I actually wanted to be in that I wanted to train in that I could go down there and sort of flip the switch and become uh a different person right that I could actually go down there and know that it get out of it and go back and relax so what I wanted to do today was take you around and show you what I did specifically here in this what I call Xbox to want to uh be down here and train first thing as you can see here my walls a y brick inside of my personal gym here because I wanted to create some sort of environment that although this is home is going to feel different than my regular living room if if it feels like my living room I might as well be on my couch and I might as well be sleeping right or just at least not working out so that it the second thing with me that dog Charlie you guys have probably seen him before I in videos Charlie comes down here see he plays he comes down here but he here with me all the time he friend okay and he is down here and he wants to hang out with me it for me to be here all right we take a walk down the end here actually I stop with my board yes even me I have goals and I have things that I don all the time two things that I working on myself I have it on my little whiteboard here thoracic Mobility I put up the days of of the how many times a week I really want to try to aim to do this so far I tonight tomorrow and Sunday though to get this done this is Friday uh to meet my goal for the week my hamstring stretching I have real tight hamstrings uh sometimes it leads to problems with my low back I Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday I want to hit that two more times the week up here I write down even business stuff anatomy of the tricep pushdowns you guys are going to see that video I film that later this week the viewer response back workout I did that already uh you guys if in case you missed it it was up on the uh Wednesday and something for overhead press but I I can even find myself working on my own self and working on athlete next and you guys and I could do it here even in my own comfortable environment so I don like I you know I do anything um the pictures I hang on the wall these guys here I don how how many guys you know are followers of baseball but these are five of the greatest players of all time or current players Carlos belon David Wright Paul aduka uh Carlos Delgado and Jose Reyes uh these guys were all extremely instrumental in my growth as a professional these guys all inspired me in all different ways because each one of these guys is all are all star and each one of these guys prepared differently they all had their own unique ways and I learned a lot from my time Major League Baseball especially working directly with these Five Guys um as to what it is and made some great friendships and they get again they inspire me I put them up here on my wall um here I was on the uh the cover of this Advanced magazine this is a a a trade publication for physical therapists it was a big deal again pts were making their Market Major League Baseball we have grown since then there Baseball now than when I was there and um I kind of leave that there is again establish goals um and and use them to you know as motivation to try to achieve them put them up around you surround yourself with that so uh as you can see you know I little environment here forget about the equipment forget about that that it just saying find a place that you can create a Nook right in your own house hang some posters up I used to hang posters up of uh Sylvester Stallone okay and Rocky 4 um that was my motivation from a fitness standpoint um but the goal here is to make sure that whatever it is you where you know it right last thing I would point out here is uh music when I down here doing just nothing I the TV as my music all right so a little rock rock music for me but this will set the environment okay I don have headphones or whatever you this is what you need to do to sort of put yourself in that frame of mine of where you need to be to get your workout in and where you need to be to find your motivation guys one of the biggest problems you up with the consistency needed to continue to head to the gym knowing that each day it might be a little uncomfortable but each day if you do something that does challenge you I promise you it will change you all right and the problem is finding that consistency because if you can that the secret guys once I I I went from hating it to loving it because I start started to see results from my training and my hard work and efforts were paying off and I think that for

Fitness and Workout Motivation - YES YOU!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arZJ0-wGZqk	ATHLEAN - X	they say it people I think it stipulations and this video is time to get you off to the right start in [Music] 2014 what athleen x.com there it meaning that most people if they could just get it going could get on a roll and transform themselves and become new people right and when we about with Fitness that means change their bodies well I don agree I think it stop most people what I mean by that is most people do have the initiative to get themselves going matter of fact starting today when you watch this video this is January 1st when I it everybody has good intentions right they all get going the gyms are packed you know where what I cuz if you work out of a gym you lucky if you can get on to your favorite piece of equipment or wherever you usually train uh find a parking spot right so starting is not necessarily the issue there but what happens is by the third week in January January I think it the people that have started a resolution will have given it up so what is it that the start it was the stipulations and what do I mean by that guys I want to talk straight with you here in this video sort of this is coach to client okay Coach to student sometimes there are things that come up that prevent us from wanting to work out those are inevitable the stipulations of the programs and the types of routines that you though make that more likely so what would be an example of that you know that I some of the DVD based workout programs for a lot of different reasons but I not really picking on them it practicality of it let your DVD based program and you place like I was over the weekend I was traveling where I my DVD player with me what do you do then okay the guys that start those type of programs on January 1 what do you do when you don you you miss your workout you wait till you come back when you have access to it again what if you lost all Motivation by that point right so that requiring that you have to have DVDs in order to follow a program secondly you need a gym membership programs that require you to have a gym membership because of the types of machines they recommend laat P Downs uh assisted dip dip machines uh Cable Crossovers right leg extension machines again that stipulation if the second you don either money for a gym membership or it Northeast and you don the gym what happens to the workout you don that gets in the way of you actually doing the workout How about if you working on at home and the requirements for the home equipment are too uh elaborate right you need to get too much stuff spend too much money on your equipment at home to have an adequate stuff to get your workout in again a stipulation not necessary but a stipulation nonetheless and one that can prevent you from doing the workouts even in the first place right you say I don have all that equipment so I can okay next up what about Out programs that require lots of your time okay workouts that are asking you for a good investment of your time you might start off 2014 saying you know what I to dedicate that hour hour and a half to my training every day because I it and believe me you are okay you are worth it but the second something else comes up or whatever habits you from now you know building up until now and you need to do take care of that first you yourself okay so if that hour the 90minut work workout was causing you a problem in 2013 that hour to 90-minute workout is going to cause you a problem in 2014 most likely by the second or third weekend of January and finally if you trying to follow a meal plan trying to follow a diet and get yourself lean because we know that component to getting yourself to look good well guys again here if your program requires you to have the skills of a budding chef with a restaurant budget most likely you keep that up e either you back to eating Twinkies or whatever it is that know that allows you to uh be fed every day all right so from a coaching standpoint though okay I might look at all those things and say those are excuses I I really would I might say you know what that every one of them you can do you can still get the job done that but what if I were able to tell you we can remove the excuses I have a way if you and remove them you can always come up with a solution and allow something that seems impossible to become possible for you guys have been watching my channel for any length of time you know that I talk about my athex training system I told you about our body weight only program athl zero these are all the tools that I created in order to remove the excuses right we wanted to make sure that whatever program you did you could do it at the gym if you want to be there I like training at the gym sometimes I prefer to train at home I could do them both places right athl X was made so that you could do it in either place athl zero it any equipment at all it decent program it programs I badass and it actually build muscle with a body weight only program so there there meal plans make them followable make them recipes that don anything but your own intuition right you don recipe list of 10 different ingredients or 12 different ingredients go out to the grocery store in order to buy them before you can start that Impractical especially for guys we not may maybe the best cooks in the world some are but most of me included are not um time I don time guys I really don trade in the time for intensity I mentioned it in many videos now we talk about it again in 2014 plenty of times because there that insist that you have to be in the gym 60 to 90 minutes and they sorry it an excuse not working hard enough if you able to last that long because you were Trad in the intensity for uh for that that length Okay I showed you you can get a really intense workout in in under 45 minutes so it all comes down to basically guys in 2014 I wanted to give you guys an incentive to make it your year to change your thought process think about what it is that holding you back not the start you probably start if you video right now my words might even be motivation to you to get started but I can tell you this it you don going I don don out there whichever one you decide to get if you don worthless cuz two weeks of good health doesn want to work on getting yourself to change your habits this year get yourself to change your outlook get yourself to actually get into the lifestyle of Fitness if I can be the guy that leads you down that road this year I because I want you guys to be able to change your lives if it free YouTube videos Watch the free YouTube videos if it leap and getting one of the programs like I mentioned before then take that leap but whatever you do make 2014 the year for you the year that you to make it different and different not just for this year but for the rest of your life guys Happy New Year I hope you uh find the right motivation here to not just get started but to remove all the stipulations and keep yourself going from now to the rest of this year and Beyond thanks guys if you haven where to go aex.com all the training options are available for you there and uh the tools are there and I will that will uh gladly take on the responsibility of helping you get in the best shape of

sure that 2014 is your best year ever I back here soon [Music] [Music] so	Success
Are you Training Hard Enough (TAKE THIS TEST!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Nxct9Sqdn4	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what today I answer the most important question that you can ask yourself when it comes to seeing results from your workouts but only you can answer it and that is are you training hard enough now before I even go into this there want you to do number one you got to get the ear muffs and put them on the kids because this is a Jeff rant video and you may not like everything you hear or how ites out of my mouth but I promise you this it will be the truth and secondly you have to start by watching just a couple Clips so we could set this whole thing up you see I barbell curls here and I want you to see if you could tell me in which one of these am I training hard enough they all barbell curls some seem to be harder than others for me at least but can you spot it now don which one you think it is at this point we later but the idea is this I could tell you it has nothing to do with whether I was screaming in one or or not in the other it has nothing to do whether I was listening to some really badass Tunes to fire me up in one that I wasn other it has nothing to do with whether or not I was sweating and leaving a pool behind me to nauseate the next person that tries to curl in the same spot as me has nothing to do with any of that the only thing that matters is only one thing and that is effort which one was my best effort and which one was I pushing harder than ever before to do one thing to accomplish one goal and that is to get more from my body than it was willing to give me think about that your body is comfortable giving you a certain level Beyond it it doesn challenge is to take it is to find out how you can get more from what your body is willing to give you that is what training hard is that is intensity that is what produces results and this is where a lot of us trip up and guess what I for this video came from I caught myself halfway through half asking a workout one night just this week actually you know and I I able to recognize that when it but the fact of the matter is it trips all of us up but look maybe are you somebody that writes down all your workouts in a journal and your Journal said for you to do 10 reps of something but when you got to 10 you probably could have done 12 but what did you do you stopped because your Journal told you to that not training hard enough maybe you their favorite exercises more often than not I can tell you this if they favorite they should be doing you only go to the ones that you find comfortable that ain give you the results you want that going to get you training as hard as you should be to get results maybe for some the accomplishment is getting to the gym that is that can standard for excellence when you there at the gym it all starts that is where you need to start doing something and not just something when you but something you ain before that is when you know you training hard enough you see you can go back to those uh exercises I did in the beginning there and you can try to guess all you want which one I effort on but I will tell you this you knows what the best effort was was me only I know whether I was actually giving it my all in any of those sets and only you will know whether you giving your all in the things that you do but I will tell you this this is a great equalizer when it comes to effort and intensity while we may not be able to tell what it looks like I can guarante Dam toe you what it to feel like and it uncomfortable if you this right it uncomfortable it ain as I say nothing in life worth having is going to come easy if it was easy do you know how many of us would be walking around looking like descendants of Frank Zayn we not easy it effort it separates the men from the boys it to just all of a sudden adopt as a lifestyle but you need to if you want to see the results that you the bottom line is I if you want to get results then you better start getting comfortable being uncomfortable the bottom line however there is another side of this equation that people tend to leave out and I won equally important to this entire aspect of your training and that is you better start doing it intelligently when you manipulating High effort and high intensity effort consistently in your training through all different types of goals whether you or speed or endurance or size or strength then you better know that you have a plan in place to allow you to realize the best aspects of those goals without breaking your body down to the point that you were either getting injured or you just simply can so it it that is where gets done that is talking about blending Purpose with intensity that they they have to be trained and thought about together because you could train like an animal and maybe a lot of us do this when we an animal you push around the gym like You ultimately if you have no plan you going to break down and I many times your body will betray you on the other side of the coin I don how smart you are I don know about the gold tend in Oregon or if you know about cyop plasmic hypertrophy and everything in between if you can put effort behind your knowledge and put it in practice it ain you by knowing those fancy terms it blending them together look here want you to do the next time you train whether it be with athl X or some other inferior program the fact of the matter is this guys give me one do me one favor please don train push improve push for something that you like I said earlier do something you never done before do something that you have never been able to accomplish before today and then tomorrow do something again that you never did up till today always push to improve for those 30 45 60 Minutes that you don with your girlfriend or where you guys are going for dinner trying to make up or what movie you or fixing your broken down car or picking up the batteries and the milk from CVS whatever the hell it is that you got to do think about none of that take all that and get out of your mind and think about just one thing and that is taking actively taking what your body is not willing to give you you win that fight and I promise you enough all right guys rant over ear Ms off uh I hope you found this video helpful yes this got me fired up but it is such an important part of training and the results that you because if you get this part wrong like I said said before it don you know doesn comes down to your effort effort is everything and it matters if you looking for a training program to help you with the part the smart part and try to teach you what you have to do when you have to do it I for you it athletex training system will spell everything out for you step by step but you got to give me the effort I will do my best to grab it out of you every single day I try to coach you through every workout and I you got to give it to me give me everything you hope you found this video helpful I be back here in just a couple days with some more content here you tell me what you want to see and I bring that to you all right guys I see you again soon see you	Success

The REAL Reason You Work Out (OR DONÂT!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gQhdqo7LmY	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] guys just heav here appex.com a little bit Whispering here today because I actually going behind the scenes I going to show you the reason why I think maybe you make changes to your body to make changes to your lifestyle to start adopting a fitness plan for those that don a while back he employee he day so Jesse other room he probably would imagine if he side by side with me he eating something that athl xfactor meal plan write something athlan approved let and see exactly how this actually works when you office there mascot of course there Jesse what YouTube you what you got going on there gummy bears gummy bears what the hell are you doing with those things you creating families of them I like to eat them by color oh nice so he Jesse come in here please you to be on a YouTube video with me he doesn going to come right over here get in position and again we uncover the real source of why uh I think Jesse is eating gummy bears no is this lacking the motivation to change cuz we things that you probably didn understand about Jesse Jesse and all the time how long have you been working here with me uh officially 3 months officially 3 months and before that as an intern months and months you gotten some awesome workouts I here in the Xbox he Jesse has access to train right here every day in the Xbox how many have you done in the time you mean zero actually guys he actually and maybe one I think he got in here one time and did one workout in the Xbox he has full access to it he me sitting side by side with him I willing to coach him on willing to give him the advice get guess what the issue is right now the issue is that Jesse is not ready and I know that a lot of people focus on me here on this channel because it is me that on camera but by bringing in Jesse I wanted to say hey guys it always look at me and say well Jeff got it all figured out this is his lifestyle this is what he does for a living this is you know of course we can a Jesse does though that you can relate to what because I think there that you can draw from this Jesse tell me why you work out isn obvious for the girls this kid comedian all the time so for the girls this is what he unfortunately so he needs to do something else but you know nice beard by the way but the the idea is for the girls what else I don ripped I want to get shredded I want to get big get big get all right so he named three things in actuality he named about the same thing yes they two very different things he want to get he wants to get more muscle definition he wants to get more size all of which is probable with the methods that I train him with we all know we can do both the idea here though is that Jesse uncovered the real reason why why do you want to get big why do you want to get ripped uh you know I want to want to look good I want he wants to look good I don you want to look good why is it important to you to look good cuz you know I want to find someone that appreciates that I guess okay now we doesn wants to actually find someone worthwhile to be with great but beyond that what would it mean to you if somebody found you and appreciated you it mean the world to me it not trying to make you cry this is not Barbara Walters here but I mean honestly I want you to be honest because I think they want you to get to in order to uncover the real reason and probably the reason why you picked on a lot when I was a kid because I was small I was you know really way way skinnier than everyone else and that was you know source of teasing for a lot of people so now we somewhere okay so Jesse because he was thin he got picked on a lot and what happening now probably I in the blanks for you a little bit you know people aren pick on him anymore his age but he probably feels like they to say stuff behind his back they still going to think things women are going to think he my type or whatever so it and the fact of the matter is maybe you just uncovered your real reason for training now and maybe you different outlook on it going forward but maybe you won this concentrate on getting big getting ripped getting it without re realizing what really is the motivation for you is going to probably hold you back and the same reason why you those gummy bears all day long I saying there having gummy bears you can eat gummy bears if you want but you better be focusing on the rest of your nutrition I know Jesse doesn every day with me and he sees me eat the right way but he hasn caught on with him yet because he hasn identified what really matters to him and I can tell you guys I that that have motivated me and got me really lit the fire inside of me and I when I was a kid you know what really first drove me to training it was that it gave me a chance to spend time with my brother you know my brother and I we were never not close but we really we were four years apart we really didn have a lot in common but when I saw him start training it gave me a reason to do the same things was doing spend some time with him and talk the same language and that was the only reason why I did it and it did bring us together and then from that point on as I started to see results I started to realize you know the same thing I was skinny too Jesse and I wanted to do things that would actually make me more appealing and find get more gain more self-confidence and I started to do that and then I wanted to do the same thing and I wanted to get a girl well I married now we have kids I old I want to be around for a long time for those kids I want to set a good example for them I don exist here on Earth as their father I want to sort of dominate here on Earth as their father I don able to show up at their High School football game because I little bit older than most parents at that age and I don old guy that the corner but the guy that can come and look good and just be Jeff cavaliere and not have to worry about people labeling me because of the fact that I myself go so you have to find whatever the real motivator is for you and I will tell you one other thing Jesse has concussions he medical history Long concussion after concussion after concussion and that has laid him up a little bit what is that done for you what are some of the things that you can concussions uh I can contact sport ever again okay how about in the weight room in the weight room I have to be very limited with the amount of uh effort I exert because if I get a migraine I can pass out and what else any specific exercise that you can you get dizzy in any types of movements I get dizzy with explosive movements um I get busy if I you know sit up too quickly you know move too quick so here over and I focusing on what you can when you walk in the gym if the first thing you think about is what I can then that can way of you ever doing what you supposed to be able to do or what you can do so for me I don you guys have seen I have a nice impressive 300 lb squat at best why because my knees kill me every time I go down to the ground but you know what I just don find an alternative of what I can do I can deadlift 500 lbs that I can do so that can never figure out what I actually can do so there you can need to train explosively at least not now there necessarily load up heavy heavy weights but you can do body weight training and it can actually you know uh serve as the foundation for building a good physique we know you can build muscle with body weight there can start but if you ready for it then you get there all right so guys do me a favor find the real reason why it is that you know you need to change because you haven the sidelines and you haven yet I know you want to but you haven figured out the real reason for those that do train don either find that real reason why you train it will probably be very easily identifiable for you because you already figured it out and it drives you every single day you get your ass out of bed you get to the gym you train late at night you train early in the morning you do it for a reason and whatever that reason is that that working out and training long into your life because you know exactly what it is that right guys I hope you found a little bit of a uh um you know this revealing behind the scenes with Jesse to be helpful at least to help you and I ever trying to embarrass Jesse he great kid and it will it will click for him one day it and he his training and he that he knows he guide him along that way when he to allow me to all right guys I back here again in just a couple days with another new video meanwhile let me know if you want to see more behind the scenes if you want me to kind of open up the kimono for you uh I that uh more often here on this channel all right guys be back here again real soon all right I couple couple curls ni this is actually by the way see you	Success
The Low Back Pain Solution (DO THIS FIRST!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFpx0cpmJ3w	ATHLEAN - X	so this video is all about back pain more importantly the truth about back pain because look whether or not you bent over to let got a stabbing pain in your back that makes it hard for you to stand up or maybe you even just woke up feeling that way and you really can bend forward to brush your teeth because you don can you just lift one leg off the ground it feels like you get back up guys back pain is an extremely common thing that happens to all of us up to 90 of us will have back pain at some point but what you do about it is where the problems lie because the truth of back pain is the advice that you opposed to the advice that you actually should be following and that means instead of resting your way through your back pain you need to be working your way through back pain so what i did in this video is i put together a series of exercises in a specific progression to show you what you can start doing right now even when it where you can get yourself to to make sure that this pain never comes back again now before i jump into the exercises guys as a responsible physical therapist i difference between nerve related discogenic type pain that goes down your legs and muscular pain the good news is that 80 to 90 percent of the time it is muscular related pain in which case everything i show you here is going to be exactly what you need to do in the rare instance that it is a disk related issue i will tell you something more encouraging 90 of those issues are not operated on in all of those issues whether or not you surgery and you come out or whether you never have it but you still need to treat a disc-related injury are still going to revolve around exercise rest is never going to be the answer exercise is always going to be and one more helpful thing that i want to make sure that i point out is if you you could hardly move and that you one thing for me watch this video i did this before on this channel it has helped millions of people to get rid of back pain right away it is again targeted at muscles specifically in your low back give it a try first because it ready to do everything else here i going to show you now all right so the first exercise we all going to do here is a simple bar hang but i want to point out something very important here and that though the location of your pain might be your low back the source is almost never the low back because we realize that the body is a kinetic chain passing forces up and down through the good old low back or in this case the poor low back we know that things like the hamstrings and the glutes are going to feed into this area and we know that the mid thoracic area is going to feed down so you got to be cognizant of what but this exercise happens to help us to do a couple things number one you can see that my feet are in contact with the ground i decompression of that area that right now feels like crap okay and the good thing is if my feet stay on the ground i muscles in the low back are going to actually release and give you some temporary relief without any additional stresses placed upon them in their most acute painful stage right now if it joint related again you the opportunity to decompress those joints just a little bit to provide you with relief all i about 60 seconds of a hold two or three times a day to start chasing some of that temporary relief to start building upon now in these next exercises so remember i said that prolonged rest was the worst thing you can do for back pain the reason is that the long-term cause of what always weakness so if you you progress is stagnation in the case of back pain the enemy of back pain is prolonged rest we need to get moving and we this exercise it there really easy to do at this point in the game really early on when you still have your problems number one we down so we don stresses that i talked about when you in your standing position number two we with a band or at the gym with a cable but we don here it doesn using it benefiting from because you can see right here at the bottom we good stretch of the lumbar pair spinals right those muscles right there that run up and down like cables the ones that tend to get tight and painful when we have low back pain but beyond that what are we doing from the top down you can see that we work here of the muscles of the lats in of the thoracic region that help in two ways if we can get better extension through our upper back then that will allow our low back to function more normally the spine is one connected unit you got to start moving right moving not resting moving to get these things to start moving the way they supposed to move this is the first exercise i want you to do all right so the next exercise is called the reverse hyper what that were is that now we gotta involve those glutes ultimately your key to long-term freedom from back pain ever happening again is going to be strengthening the glutes working that kinetic chain from the bottom up and you can see that all you have to do is support yourself on the edge of either a bed or a bench and the key is getting above parallel right because we want to make sure that that glutes are driving hip extension getting your hips up past parallel to the ground and to ensure that we got to lift them as high as we possibly can now how does this work the low back well it back but it the glutes up here so we this first as a transition to the next exercise which is actually going to start driving the same thing but from the top down realizing that the focus on the low back first is going to be a little bit more intense so for you to start i want to make sure that you learning how to drive through the glutes first and then into the low back actually you worked that reverse hyper and now you exercise up in the progression right and what we do is we do another version of a hyper extension but this time we drive it from the top down or at least it looks like we down but always when we do any of these extension movements guys we are still driving it from the glutes you can see that i and stabilize so i can support the low back and then i pull up and lift up with the upper body but what about this progression is we off of our feet which allows us to do this at an earlier stage only four steps in at this point but what important is we muscles right we to be a little bit more engaged by having a little additional weight in our hands not to mention this additional weight is going to allow the low back to get stronger progressively overloading those weak muscles in a synchronization that is important for its ultimate function and more importantly to having you never have to experience this low back pain again alright so at this point now your back is probably feeling better but where do we take it from there because remember it painful it make sure this never returns again so we got to get on our feet i mentioned the last time when we get on our feet here that because we activate that kinetic chain the forces that start all the way down here at our feet are gonna be transferred all the way up through those hips into the low back and i gotta make sure that your back is able to handle it this pull through exercise is where we like to start and the key here is this not only is it reinforcing and teaching you how to properly hinge for good hip mechanics that feed low back mechanics but more importantly is getting those hamstrings glutes and low back to work together as you can see here in one shot glutes hamstrings low back all firing at the right time in the right sequence and able to handle heavier loads because this exercise provides us the opportunity to do that actually now you the pull through you don pain in your back anymore you stronger but where do you go from there remember if the truth about your back pain was that it wasn structural issues but more importantly likely coming from weakness up and down that kinetic chain then the strength of that kinetic chain is going to be your salvation and this exercise is one you probably didn were someone that back pain for a while and it deadlift it it do if you have a bad back but done after you built that foundation that base up because what it does is it reinforces the same thing we been working on here through the pull through right it the main driver of hip extension feeding that kinetic chain and more importantly the low back muscles from the ground up at the same time you can see that at the top here it lower half right it ability of all the muscles of your back to contribute to what happening here and being born by the low back right working that kinetic chain from the top down and working it from the bottom up the fact is because you can overload this exercise to the next level and reinforce all the things we been working towards it next step for you to get over this back pain and to build the strength necessary to make sure it never comes back again all right and last but not least we have the barbell row and you might be thinking why is this above a deadlift how is this more difficult or more demanding on your low back it about the positioning of your body and we it is to support your low back first and foremost with your glutes and what the glutes are doing here is while they are contributing they in a more isometric way they driving this movement you can see that they are getting in position there and staying locked in that position not to mention the fact that what that does is it shifts the demands onto the low back more significantly to hold and lock yourself into place anybody that done this exercise knows that you have to have a good strong back to maintain the proper posture thirdly because of where we carry this load when we lift it it further out in front of our body than it would be tight against our body in a deadlift so that increases the demands on your low back for all these reasons guys it it until you have the strength necessary to be able to do this right so there you have it guys remember the truth about back pain is that in most instances we in the muscles of your back up and down that kinetic chain it something about it and by doing something about it it doesn resting more it means actually getting into action and doing something in a sequential way that makes sense and builds upon the foundation you to build to make sure that there slip ups along the way if you for a program guys where we make sure that all of our exercises are selected in a way to support the proper sequencing of them they athletics.com if you found the video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below let me

The DUMBEST Exercise Ever (KB OR NOT!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJbTloTx9eo	ATHLEAN - X	oh hey what are you doing what is that oh dude I uh learn how to use kettle bell cleans with this yeah it YouTube video all right guys sort of perform the kettle bell clean properly you want to get up whip it back alright you might feel little tearing sensation in your elbow that it also your shoulder if you feel something you know pull or tear in there I think you nothing and last but not least you want to get the kettlebell slam into your forearm because the tibia and the femur the biggest bones of your body they resilient they and it scars from scraping up your shin that not Steve Kotter no I I saw one of those ads on Instagram so I clicked on it first thing as you do is take a body tight test what a body tight test tells you what your body type is you can train without knowing your body type and what I tell you dump thin you need to test to tell you that no the mirror told me that but that just confirmed it so if you don learning how to clean you bro alright that ahh something tore Oh what athleanx.com that is not how you kill a bell clean and okay all right it joke so jokes yes you very much okay okay good you guys another telling sign that that was an absolute joke is Jesse would never get caught dead watching a [\\xa0__\\xa0] like that never right absolutely so what we want what we want to do though is we want to talk about the fact that that is a reality that is being taught and you need to be careful where you for your information so we can always as we try to do here in this channel let take something like that and at least provide a jump-off or something that is going to help you and hopefully prevent something like that from happening but even more something that actually is happening in our elbows it less obvious and I covered it on a video before that bears being repeated here because it is that important I might say that it ever done before back to that clean real quick right we are doing what you doing there okay a few things wrong here guys if you didn were joking about this first of all come over a little closer here when you bring that kettlebell up in a clean and by the way if you haven I a favor go watch any of Steve Conners videos on how to do kettlebell cleans or anything with a kettlebell the guy master at using them I had him speak in my live event two times because I believe he out there when it comes to using a kettlebell but in the meantime if you go up and you start flipping the kettlebell out the first thing is by going and bringing this up out away from your body you up and then land somewhere and that landing is gonna happen right up against the back of your arm here which contains what bones Jesse oh if I that right here so you want to make sure you don actually have guys in our reality is now you elbow hurts doesn on the elbow when you position here and you could tear something in here very easily or at the very least give yourself a low tendonitis and then we subscapularis that sits in here that an internal rotator that doesn all this force ballistic external rotation here that can also become strained and of course you delicate shoulder here that could take all kinds of injury just because you following the wrong advice so Jessie let way we talked about is this zippering right come straight up the kettle goes straight up you keep the kettlebell closer to your body and you bring it up again watch these videos on how to do that and you why you want to do it differently so now what is the other way that we actually succumb to elbow tendonitis where teaching point here the teaching point is that take this in guys and I promise you it information that here when you get elbow tennis on the inside of your elbow any of that pain whenever you curling whether you doing pull-ups here why you are causing too much strain on those deep finger flexors because of where you the bar and those exercises you want to watch the entire video that I did right here where I break it down muscle marker and all about why that happening but for the quick recap for those that either don watch that or want to know right here and why it looking at here if you were to grab the bar here and a pull-up it grabbing the bar you want to grab it not here in the fingers because that puts all that overload stress on the deep finger flexors that attach to that last digit here and your fingers okay and only the one that cut that attaches to the last digit you want to get the bar down into your hands so that when you go and wrap your fingers around there is no more stress on these digits that contain that muscles attachment if you here that and that muscles not strong enough to hold all the load of your body so when you go through the bar here you don grip here in the fingers you grip in the pubs okay all the way down across this portion of my palm if I curl come on over we here people get elbow pain again this is insidious it happens they have no idea why it repetitions with the wrong placement on the bar on the grip so you come in here you don and then lift it you gonna over time you through that medial elbow because the bar will start to drift down and all this stress and load on that deep finger flexor is going to cause that to cause pain on the inside of the elbow so what you do is you grab here with the thumb here with the thumb leave with your thumbs then wrap the hands around now you is in the meat of the hand as opposed to being in the fingers right and then lastly we can even talk about any kind of rowing here let high cable row the same thing would happen here if you grab here with the fingers you pull that way you get a lot of stress on that inside of the elbow do the same thing grab here first reach up wrap around that way now it pull from here I promise you you never get any more elbow tendonitis now the other stuff that hope nobody out there at least that watches this channel it advice and having that happen to them instead this is the kind of stuff that creeps up on you and this is the stuff that there you have it guys hopefully another example here of it exercises you do it do the exercises that matter there nothing wrong with a kettlebell clean if you do it the right way as a matter of fact I guess it underscores another point it exercises it information from on how to do the exercises that matters and that you want to make sure you reliable source I hope you guys realize that this is a reliable source for that kind of information and more if you looking for a complete program that lays it all out puts the science back in strength not just plumb edge studies either guys actual science on real people that actually take all the history of working with professional athletes and regular guys and put it all together for you in a step-by-step system that athleanx.com in the meantime if you found the video helpful

The Most Common Gym Injury (FIXED | PREVENTED!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXjaCsUlrZs	ATHLEAN - X	what athletes.com so today i am going to help a lot of people because a lot of people are getting elbow pain when they lift now if you have elbow pain you know it and you go out there and keep banging away at it whether you doing chin ups whether you weighted chins which is even worse whether you pulling movement that you that pain right on that inside of the elbow you know it feels like a knife here it i figure that out and i could do to try to get rid of it now and more importantly prevent it from ever coming back right so of course we do that jesse come on in with the muscle marker so the muscle marker we actually are kind of picking on one muscle here because there are a lot of muscles in the forearm but this one muscle in particular is where i think everything arises and then i actually show you how you can test yours to see if that your pain too so if we look at this i the fancy word you the flexor digitorum superficialis so the fds what it means is one of the flexors that goes to the digits in our fingers that than some of the other deeper muscles in our forearm but what it does it actually looks like that and it attaches right here all comes down into this bundle here attaches around that medial elbow where we start to feel all that pain amongst a whole bunch of other muscles that also come in here that sometimes get confused as the source of the pain i the problem right here so what this muscles function it does it actually comes in here and splits into four different tendons and they pass through the carpal tunnel and head off towards the pinky the ring finger the middle finger and the pointer finger but the attachment means everything they actually cross over to the second joint right so not all the way to the end not to this little joint on the end right they have no control over that only the the phalanges out here in the middle so that means they can do this to the finger and they can do that to the finger and they can do that but they can flex that last little phalange so what we want to do is we want to understand how what the problems well it one in particular this one right here you would think it because the way it feels when you have this pain but it right here your ring finger and when you move them you can see what happens so if i were to just go here and move the pinky you can see that i get some action obviously through this muscle belly but not so much if i move the ring finger i mean the middle finger i get some action but not that much if i go through the pointer finger i get even less action more up here than i do down here and then when i move that ring finger look at all the motion going on in here definitely the most influential of the four on what happening through this muscle ultimately on that point of attachment on your elbow which is going to really cause a problem when it so what happens is we overload on this joint in this motion here through some sort of a heavy weight being attached to our hands down below in a pole like a row or on a cable pull down or a low row or even up here on a chin okay when i whole body weight being resisted here by the strength of my finger flexors to be able to hold on to that bar so if you have problems here people will call a long-term breakdown and they say it overuse injury it injury guys it an overload injury that can actually happen on one single rep by causing some micro tears down here because the strength in these fingers just is is not high enough to withstand those loads so what you what you have to start looking at is where are you placing the pull-up bar or the bar itself or the cables in whatever exercise you them ride high into your fingers like that then all these muscles are the the muscles here that are coming into these tendons are trying to resist that bar from falling out of your hands or you from slipping off the pull-up bar that using this muscle in particular because of where you holding it you these last couple joints up here we can with just that little joint there we picking directly on this muscle here the fds completely and it hold all those loads what you need to do is you need to get that bar here or the pull-up bar or the row down here more in your hands with more of a wrap around here so you strength of those intrinsic hand muscles with support from the fds not the main load being with the fds so where do you see that if i were to get up on this bar here here that direct cause if i were to get up here and i try to hold on to the bar a lot of us like to use this false grip i like to use the false grip we there literally on that muscle because of the anatomy i just showed you so as i start to get tired even more so i want to slip but they hard as they can it places a tremendous amount of stress right here on the medial elbow that can cause that pain instantly and get worse and worse over time from workout to workout so you want to get up and over the bar and be on top of it okay you want to see all your fingers and i see people do these all the time and what i see is i see the top of your fingers if you can only see the top of your fingers there especially this little finger it that way behind you you got a problem you need to be able to see all your fingernails and all your fingers if it positioning that avoid that again that fourth finger is going to take out all the load why is that go ahead and make a fist if i make a fist as hard as i can which fingers have the strongest ability to hold right here the fourth and fifth you can feel it you can feel that you putting more most of your pressure right here in this portion of your palm because the fourth and fifth dig in with a lot more force than we do with these other three so you realize how dependent your fingers are on this fourth and fifth finger and again putting that bar too high is gonna cause that i do the same thing here with a row if i come up underneath with an underhand row and i start to fatigue starts to slip a little bit we that same thing all that force is there so let already have the pain you whether this is the problem or not just do this take your finger and first use the other fingers resist through that joint so bend it and just try to push it back and don don no pain there should be no pain there not distal not this last joint because that muscle the flexor digitorum for fundus the deeper version that that that takes care of that not this muscle so you shouldn same thing here now go to the proximal joint resist that motion no problem no problem no problem oh that there if you have a pain in that elbow resisting at that level of the joint is going to cause a lot of pain you know instantly that this is what you dealing with so what do we do to fix it what we do to fix it is it whereas the prevention is the cure so first of all if you already having problems here you really need to avoid bar placements in your finger and your distal fingers for for definite you you stop doing that that away you need to do that most of all though we usually have to start avoiding any of the movements that are causing discomfort at this point so you give yourself sometimes six to eight weeks for it to get better by avoiding those those movements and that sucks nobody wants to do it but it but once you do that you want to then start easing yourself back into those movements not with as heavier weight because the heavier the weight the more likely it going to start to pull down with a little bit lighter weight to ensure yourself that you have the ability to grip and hold on in that position it to right but lastly what you want to do is you want to at least right now try to stretch it out a little bit and here they do this people like oh i know i know it so they told me just to stretch it so i do that what hand if i i feel a stretch here in my forearm but am i really getting this muscle no in order to get that muscle i can just not pay attention to what my wrist back i have to get these bent all the way back and straight you see i i have them bent back and then the wrist is bent back and now it extension here now i really feel that stretch right so if you you got to make sure especially on that fourth finger that you are straightening it out and getting it back okay at the same time you want to keep those other fingers straight okay so you stretch it out you ice it if you have to sometimes anti-inflammatories if it bad avoiding the things that are really causing the problem in the first place but easing yourself back in learning how to grip that bar properly and now understanding finally what the hell pain over here because this usually comes and people have no idea what caused it this is what it is guys i promise you if you start following what i show you here it found this video helpful we again anatomy all the muscle markers everything matters every muscle this is the first time i on my forearm but it doesn less valuable as you see because when there it screws up your entire workout all these muscles matter we make sure all of it is is covered and put into all of our programs because we do like to put the science back in strength to build your entire body from head to toe and fingertip to keep you training and looking like an athlete guys that over there step by step in the meantime if you found this video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know what else you want me to cover and i you in the days and weeks ahead all right see you soon	Success
This Exercise CAUSES Hernias (IT'S VERY POPULAR!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLHGa2MCI_A	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com today I what the worst exercise is when it comes to causing hernias in the gym and more importantly I you could do to fix that exercise now here never had a hernia before if you are a man you need to be concerned about this because one in four men are going to suffer a hernia at some point in their life so that means you probably know at least a couple guys even if you haven had one yourself and you might want to share this with them to help them out but the thing is people think I know what it is do you have anything when you get in the gym you got a load up a lot of weight like let on the bar here come down and that the cause of the hernia guys as a matter of fact it that you hernia it body when you for me by far the exercise that takes the cake for causing hernias uses just a single dumbbell in this bench and it the one-armed dumbbell row now guys I love the one on a dumbbell row I program the one on a dumbbell row I videos on the one on a dumbbell row I shown you how to correct some of the other issues that come along with the one on dumbbell row in terms of the hunching of the back and not using proper form to actually use the lats to get the dumbbell up through and past into extension past your body but here the problem our own Anatomy a lot of times betrays us and sets this up as the exercise that causes the problem and I this exercise twice I literally doing this exercise alone and the thing again to show you how much I liked it even after the first time I figured it was a fluke I kept doing it the way I was doing it and I actually suffered a second hernia a couple years ago the straw that broke the camel back for me was woman I just had a high performing athlete come in here and we were actually working on trying to re-establish balance through his pelvis and up through his groin because of the repercussions of having a hernia from guess what as we did our history doing this exercise he felt that common zipper like burn that goes up here through the groin here exercise we grab one weight and again yes the heavy you go here the more likely you have an issue the fact is though you can still do it with a lighter weight but we get into position like this we drop one leg on the outside one knees up on the bench one hand is here now again we corrected the issues of having our background in and all that but what I talking about when it comes to the hernia is the position that we just placed ourselves in in relation to our groin so with this leg out to the side I don through this leg but I have just enough and I have a lot of my weight in through this leg that as I go to pull I my pelvis okay so the pelvis still is going to be impacted by the fact that one foot is on the ground and this is up here again bearing weight through the femur on the bench the pelvis is still impacted meaning all that muscles that attach to it including the abdominal muscles here are going to be impacted because of this asymmetrical load here and the pre-stretched position of my leg out to the side I am now in a big position that especially with a heavier weight as I come down there little bit of a squat here that to load this and stretch this out even a little bit more I talked about the anatomy guys when we children our testicles drop down into position and they drop through the inguinal canal a lot of times that England canal is not closed off you causing an area for compromise or an area of weakness and the abdominal muscles down here secondly the spermatic cord that runs down here and feeds into your testicles literally goes through and exits through a hole through your abdominal muscles that is already weakening this structure women don have nearly as many hernias in england hernias because they don element there they don weakness already compromising the abdominal muscles so you have that so by fact that you have a hole already in place even if your muscles are very strong as a matter of fact I would argue the stronger they are the more likely you are going to incur a hernia because you have a lot of tension in here that pulling on an area that already has a hole that leads to the herniation right here in your lower abdominal region and causes that inguinal hernia which is that notable bump or a lump because what you actually sticking through that hole and pushing up against your skin and you can see that little lump and bump here so here can recommending that we make a change can I there we won the exercises itself and all you have to do is straddle the bench so instead of setting yourself up that way you straddle the bench this way you don have to get nearly as wide so when you Center your hand on your chest right here like this you can be in this more athletic position with both feet on the ground you don to the side again you don a wide stance out there with my legs so far out as I was or even back as I am now I I get my head up I get my ass up my back arched my shoulders drop chest out pull up two three four and again we the over-rotate to try to cheat this dumbbell off if you can thing up into extension elbow back behind your body then you probably use into a heavier weight anyway okay soon as we over the other side and we go we knock out the other side but this is a much better position again not compromising the effectiveness of the exercise at all for your lats and your back but putting symmetrical loading through your legs into your pelvis that takes away in the likelihood that you some sort of herniation by doing this exercise guys like I said from experience I it burning zipper right up here and then you got we or not you go through it until you can it anymore so guys I hope you found this video helpful in the meantime if you looking for a science-based training program where the anatomy plays into it how you perform your exercises plays into it everything matters that athleanx is all about you can find our programs over at athleanx.com the meantime found this video helpful do me a favor and share it with somebody else there find real benefit from it if you do alright guys we just a couple days with more videos see [Music] you	Success
How to Fix Elbow Pain (ONE SIMPLE EXERCISE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kTNk3qEuLM	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com so elbow pain is a very common side effect sometimes of training it and I not gonna say inappropriate training because it we attention to the muscles that actually control and command and prevent the elbow pain from occurring so when we are lifting will either get pain right here on the inside of our elbow pretty common or we elbow now either place can be pretty debilitating in terms of trying to grip a bar so here today because I promise you this is going to work and it doesn whole hell of a lot of extra time what we do is you get a set up here inside of a bar inside of a rack just so that we have something about chest height and what we realize that our elbow is really not the problem guys what slave to the joints below and above it now you might be thinking to yourself I Jeff moment regards to knee pain that the knee is really basically being controlled by what happens down here the ankle and what the hip because the knee is just a hinge joint and if my ankle is all jacked up then the knee gets twisted and turn in weird ways and if the hip is all weak or jacked up it knee again twisting in all different kinds of ways so a lot of torque and knee pain well the elbow is the same thing just despite the fact that your hands are not in contact with the ground doesn it as obvious as it would be with say the ankle so we want to do is we want to make sure that we strengthen and stabilize the wrist and forearm and then up here in the shoulder so one exercise can actually handle all that we get here underneath a bar and we just let recline our body a little bit behind us now the wider that we have our hands is the more challenging this is going to become and the more centralized we have this one hand the easier it is as far as the recline on the body the higher up I am the start the easier it is the more I come underneath the bar the more challenging it becomes so if we want to start this out we could go with a centralized hand position with a more upright body so we get ourselves here to start watch the centralization will come in a second just like this and then what we want to do is we want to take one hand put it in the center so it body and all we do is let go with one hand and try to maintain that same position here of our shoulders and torso meaning no tilting because what it wants to do is tilt and pull away from the body you see how the shoulder wants to get pulled forward so you have to just make sure that you hold your torso here stable and level and that we don that over distraction here the arm and you work to hold on and maintain that position and where your goal is is to be able to do this for about 45 to 60 seconds and at the same time you obviously are working the flexors here in your forearm to also improve your grip and forearm stability - and it do that great then we go over here we switch hands and work on the same thing and again we don dropping here okay now as we progress because that to that wide position so what we do here is we let go and now we have the same challenge but you can see that the weight is now more displaced off to the side with more of a tendency to fall so I have to work even harder to hold that so we do the same thing we work to see if we can do that for 60 seconds whatever ability level you struggle at that towards okay then we can go back and lower the body now we just have more weight of gravity forcing downward that we have to control so we start again back in the middle one arm here and hold don chest out and don not even a little bit and I up now okay and you work on that again on both sides the other thing you could do finally is once you get in that position you can go dynamic where you switch hands and I don even a single inch of drop so when I get here and I can see a little bit of that first no you guys stabilized come off come here switch no tilting up switch no tilting and see if you do ten switches how tough that guy prioritizing forearm strength and grip strength is imperative to protecting your elbows and you anybody that watched me worked out I will do this in between sets Here I am just grabbing a bar and hanging instead of just sitting around doing nothing I try to work on my grip strength which I think has led to a lot of other lifts being stronger it helps me definitely on the deadlift and it helps me with all of my exercises really I actually do it here I mix it down I instead of just doing all two handed hanging stuff sometimes I now I will caution you if you have issues with your shoulder this could be a challenge at first but it helping me to get over my labrum issues because I stabilizing my shoulder and preventing that deep stabilization that comes from having a torn labrum so all of it in time guys you got to find out where you sit and what you need to work on but this is how you get over elbow pain stop focusing on the elbow the elbow is a hinge joint that consequence of what and above it just like in the lower body so guys I hope you found this video helpful if you that cares about all this stuff because it all matters so we call putting the science back in strength we have that over at athleanx.com and the meantime if you found this video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below and I will cover what it is you want me to do in the future weeks alright guys see you soon [Music] you	Success
YouÂre NOT as Strong as You Think! (THE TRUTH)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3BSvePXM4s	ATHLEAN - X	What Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. Today I want to cover a very important topic. The topic of strength. You see, we did a recent video and had our\\nguy Jesse here, and we talked about the gains he’s been making recently. First of all, Jesse thanks you for all the\\nnice things that were said about him. Then there were a couple of not nice things. Like “Jesse still looks like a girl.” I saw the comment. JESSE: What the f**k, guys?! JEFF: Honestly, when is the last time you\\nsaw a girl with a beard like that? I mean, that’s confirmation alone that Jesse’s\\nall man, making all man gains. Honestly, we do have to talk about strength\\nbecause there’s a lot to learn here, and people wanted to know more about the point\\nI made about that line. That fine line between true strength and compensatory\\nstrength. I think we need to go over that and break\\nit all down because I think there are some really good things you can learn from that. So, let’s start this all out by first defining\\nwhat strength is. The classic definition of strength is ‘your\\nability to generate force against some sort of external load, or resistance’. That’s pretty much what it is. The issue with that definition, and why I\\nthink we need to take it a step further is that doesn’t necessarily rule out, or take\\nout of the equation, this idea of compensatory strength. Meaning, what compensations are you making\\nto produce that force? Because you could be doing a lot of that. As a matter of fact, as I argued in Jesse’s\\nvideo, there is a lot of that happening. Especially with Jesse. Especially a lot of times with beginners who\\ndon’t take the time to build from the ground up and are speeding toward higher, and higher\\nnew PRs every, single time they hit the gym. They’re not taking the time to develop what\\nthey need to. The idea as a trainer for athletes is, I have\\nto be extremely concerned about differentiating between true strength and compensatory strength. I know that as an athlete goes onto the field\\nof competition they’re going to become a lot more spontaneous, in terms of the force\\nthat they generate. They’re competing. They’re not working in a controlled environment. But we have to know that their true strength\\nis maximized as much as possible because the earlier they have to rely on compensations\\n– compensatory strength – the degree to which they have to compensate, and the frequency\\nwith which they have to compensate are all major determinates in terms of how likely\\nthat person is to become injured. If they have to do this more often, more frequently,\\nor to a greater degree than their likelihood of injuring themselves by making these compensations\\nis higher. We don’t want to see that. We can’t afford to see that. We need to make sure we’re seeing the true\\nstrength as maximized as possible and that demands we become more alert to the small\\ncompensations. What is the compensation here? It’s not obvious stuff. We’re not talking about swinging a barbell\\nback on a curl like this or looking like an angry cat when you’re deadlifting. That’s just called piss-poor form. We’re not talking about that. When we talk about compensation, realizing\\n– especially when it comes to athletes – that athletes are masters of compensation. They know how to make compensations without\\nit even being noticeable to the person that’s watching them or coaching them. Unless you have a trained eye. And certainly, sometimes they don’t even\\nfeel it themselves. By nature, compensations are actually more\\neffective – efficient. The reason why you compensate is because you’re\\ndoing a more efficient movement pattern and you’re making that lift become effective\\nwhen it shouldn’t be because you don’t have the strength in the first place to actually\\nexecute it. We can’t let that go. We can’t just say “Hey, train around it. You’re going to get better at it.” That’s not how it works. Once your body becomes efficient in fighting\\nthis effective pattern, which is unwanted and pathologic, then you have to figure out\\na way to intervene. It’s like knowing the shortcut once you\\nlearn the short way home. You’re never going to take the long way\\nanymore unless you’re trying to go for a scenic drive. There’s no point. We need to be able to intervene on that and\\ndecrease the reliability on their compensatory strength by increasing that focus on developing\\nthat true strength. What are some real examples then? If we’re talking about a real example, I\\njust had an athlete come in here, a high performing athlete who was having some issue with hip\\npain on a deadlift. To anyone that was watching – as a matter\\nof fact, this person was actually recording themselves doing the lift. To anybody watching, there was nothing you\\ncould detect from their form. Everything looked great. The bar path was great. The loading of the hips was great. The positioning of the back throughout was\\ngreat. Everything was great. But what I saw – again, I’ve been doing\\nthis a long time, guys. I saw something very, very slight that I didn’t\\neven have confirmation of until we broke out force plates. I thought I saw a little bit of tilting on\\nthe bar on the way up, indicating that there might have been a little bit of a weight shift. The weight shift could come from a lot of\\ndifferent things. As it turns out, it could potentially come\\nfrom a little bit of a hip impingement issue on that side in trying to get off that hip\\na little bit as you get down, deeper into the deadlift. Now, we break out the force plates and what\\nhappens? As they’re coming up they’re about 50/50\\non the way down. The minute they start to come out of the hole,\\nout of the bottom of the deadlift and they come up I see this shift to a 55/45. Which is enormous. That’s one that may not come back and bite\\nhim on that individual rep, but if you do that day, after day, session after session,\\nworkout after workout; that’s going to become a problem. That’s not something that’s just going\\nto disappear. That’s going to be ingrained and strengths\\nwill be developed around that compensatory strength. We can’t allow that to happen. Now, you apply that to a squat it gets even\\nmore problematic. In the bottom of a squat you may not see it. You may not. But you could probably feel sometimes when\\nsomeone makes a slight shift. They’re down in the hole, they’re going\\nto come out of it, and they make a slight shift away. Why do we do that? It could be for a whole host of reasons. It could be because of the actual anatomy\\nof your hip and how it’s shaped. That could be one thing, but you’re not\\nchanging that no matter what weight you’re lifting. It could be because you’re lacking dorsiflexion\\nat the bottom of that lift, so you unload it to not have to be as dorsiflexed on the\\nbottom, on that ankle. Again, that would probably show up if you\\nwere having – no matter what the load was that you’re using. But mobility issues do get worse as you increase\\nthat load. It could be, again, this issue of this impingement. As I go away from that side, usually the pelvis\\non that side will come forward, which creates a relative external rotation in that hip,\\nwhich is creating a little more room if you have a hip impingement going on. As the load becomes bigger I find I might\\nbe doing that more often, or maybe it’s just a quad weakness and when I finally get\\nto the bottom there, my right leg is not as strong as my left leg, so I try to rely on\\nthe left leg a little more and I shift off of it. All of these things could be so minute that\\nunless you have a trained eye watching them, or unless you have experience doing this lift\\nso many times you might not even feel it yourself. But it doesn’t make it any less problematic. If you keep adding weight to the bar every,\\nsingle session after that you’re only making that problem worse. You need to intervene and get rid of that\\ncompensation. Remember, not just blatant, ridiculous looking,\\nbad form. But this compensation often times hidden or\\nsubtle, if you want to continue to build true strength without piling on more compensatory\\nstrength. Another example I’ll give you, we actual\\nwent over in our meetings, and they actually had a machine that was testing Nordic ham\\nstrength, your ham strength on a Nordic hamstring raise. Where you hook your legs underneath, almost\\nlike a glute-ham raise. You lower your body down, and then pull yourself\\nback up. One of my colleagues that was there with me,\\nthe difference in strength between his two hamstrings in initiating the pull to get your\\ntorso back up to vertical was ridiculous. Off by about 40%. Ask him if he felt the difference. He didn’t feel any of it. So, your body is hiding that discrepancy. Allowing yourself to believe that you have\\nequalized strength between both legs when it was anything but what was occurring in\\nthis guy’s lower body. It’s another argument for why, as athletes\\nhere, we often train you single legged. We have to see if you can reveal those discrepancies\\nin other ways. But again, if you’re not necessarily having\\naccess to the force plates, having an awareness with what’s going on with your body, don’t\\nhave someone measuring your strength on a Nordic hamstring raise; what do you do? Often times you just keep training and piling\\non weight, leading to more dysfunction, causing more issues. People would say “Jeff, as a physical therapist\\nyou’re too concerned about this.” I have to be. It’s my job. But beyond that, I realize and understand\\nthe importance of this because I see the people that come to me with the results of not addressing\\nthis difference. It’s not just about strength. You have to have your true strength and understand\\nthat the compensatory strength that will come along with that has to be stopped as soon\\nas possible. Then build on that because this is certainly\\nnot an attack on heavy weights. I believe in training with heavy weights and\\nloading up, but only if you’ve developed that base, built on a solid foundation, eliminating\\nas many compensatory movements as possible. Even those subtle ones. Even if you need the help of someone to help\\nyou find them out so when you build on that you’re building true strength. The more true strength you have, and the greater\\nyou can raise that level there, the less likely you’re going to have to rely on those other\\ncompensations. Which is going to decrease your chance of\\ninjury. It doesn’t just have to be an athlete. It could be anyone in the gym that’s ever\\nhad issues. Ask yourself when you’re making these compensations\\n“Have you ever blown out your back doing squats? Do you have back problems, or back pain after\\ndoing squats?” I can tell you this, if you’re unfortunate\\nenough to the point where you’ve actually had to go in and have it repaired it may not\\neven be fixed. A lot of times the nerve damage that’s left\\nover from some of those injuries will stay with you for the rest of your life. Same thing with bad knees. You do this for a long enough period of time,\\nyou wear down the cartilage, you develop osteoarthritis in your knees; that ain’t going away. It’s not changing. So, it’s incredibly important to intervene\\nnow. The reason we take a guy like Jesse – who\\nis 24, by the way. 24 years old! If we can intervene now and build a baseline,\\neven if it takes a little longer than what people might want to do or feel like they\\nneed to invest that time in the beginning. They’d rather jump right into those heavy\\nweights. Look at how much time he’s got for the rest\\nof his lifting life now to hopefully be building true strength on a solid foundation. Hopefully a long time, right? This is not a short game, guys. It’s never a sprint. This is for the long term. If you go back to what the approach was that\\nwe’re using with Jesse, you want to focus on your bigger lifts. Of course you do. He always bench-presses, he rows, he squats,\\nhe deadlifts, he presses overhead. But we’re trying to do it where we’re\\nminimizing the obsession and urge to pile weights on first until we realize that we’ve\\naddressed all these things. He came to me with lots of compensations,\\nguys. Again, maybe I’ve become a little overanalytical\\nof them because this is what I’m trained to do, but I don’t think that belies the\\nfact that they still need to be addressed, identified, and eliminated. So that’s the big difference, guys, between\\nwhat we talked about what true strength is. What I want you guys to realize on this channel\\nis, we want strength. Strength is a prerequisite for anybody. Not just athletes, but for anybody trying\\nto function better. There’s a big difference and we have to\\ndelineate between true strength and compensatory strength, and we have to start becoming more\\naware of that. And if we become more aware of that then we\\ncan do something about it. Guys, in our ATHLEANX training programs I\\ndo that all the time. Again, I can’t separate the physical therapist\\nfrom the strength coach because it all matters. It all comes together in the end. We put that in all of our programs. We put the science back in strength. That’s what we do in all of our programs. If you’re interested in training with them\\nyou can find them over at ATHLEANX.com. In the meantime, if you’ve found this video\\nhelpful, if it was a little bit of an eye opener, leave your comments and thumbs up\\nbelow. Let me know what else you want me to cover\\nand I’ll do my best to do that for you int eh days and weeks ahead. All right, guys. See you soon.	Success
WWE Jinder Mahal Workout | Assessment (PART 2)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3PL7Eyg7og	ATHLEAN - X	I love when my athletes come through here to train it favorite part of what I do but Jesse you know he he can make things really uncomfortable so listen man if you really want to get big like this is what you got to do you really really got to focus on the contraction trust me I know it was better than anyone I put on 12 pounds in a year it telling you if you want this if you want to get big you want to get huge you got to listen to me bro you listen so listen the contraction did put on 12 pounds of muscle in one year you know what I think you all right that me man give me high it this is where we you grab the five pound dumbbells over here and by uncomfortable I mean uncomfortable for me right there right there right there difference yeah you going when you gonna need your knees some are Smoove it so i where i teach that is if I pregnant here you know there little life do you bring that that where the hip in it happens right right in there those lines are here in here so make those connectors there you go that right there feel it so everything you start whenever you of explosive exercise you know from full from here here yeah you know everything I do I just because then these are giving your body is lowering so things is doing the right thing but really the lowering should come from the hips first so any power exercise you can push press if you weren push perhaps 20% more it so I now a lot more a lot more powerful but the main point was we impress from any position where you put your arm before nearby you don there right right you any any pain once you start to go in this direction you ain in this direction it and going back one of the best ways that hit the Dallas I hate upright rows okay I got hate them with the passion I think they exercises you could ever do for your shoulder because if you came to me I said yeah I think I got a problem not like I might have impingement and I might say to you alright hold on let me test so I put you like this yeah I go like this and say all right now push up on my hand you know and I doing that purse you know yeah that exactly what the top right roll is doing it putting weight on it so it you biggest issue that is where the elbows are traveling if the elbows are in line with your body or I like down on an upright row I don if you stop with the nipple leave it for yourself I stop with the nipple it okay yeah it in this position and a weights out in front this way that creates that internal rotation to any some reason I know I to do it so what it should feel like instead is if your arms were back behind your body into extension was it already - Dorian sets up postural things that were working what I for most people it solid effort you know yeah because even if you stiii state train as hard as you can yeah but if someone can put a gun to your head you able to do two or three more even at that point it train with CT yeah well I quitting for the shot so funny thing is he tells me so you did the gauntlet right you got me there so I personally done 45 tricep extension yeah never I always do like kind of shoot that more like I 30 35 you know so he starts to go out and he starts in 45 huh you got to 20 of these yeah and 20 of these sounds like I never lit so violent one no way so I go and I did knock out 20 of the 45 and then I holy me pointing the way back I was convinced there I could barely doing on the first one yeah and somehow some way I like them he what is your every set every level if you biggest things that majestic like you know he know I not I was 12 that last hard you know otherwise you really didn yeah not the quantum change so you just doing it just to get a workout in and that change yeah the traps also interfere with your bench yeah so what happens is so now I shoulder blades there now when you come down already your delts are almost in front of your chest so you want to roll them back okay like that now keep them here initiate from there feel that it started here right yeah and I almost think about bringing the biceps closer together then I do the dumbbells I see us going with this don dumbbells the dumbbells are that whatever we go down so we that here yep thank you and then box us together feel that just like it go ahead and let let your shoulders do a regular pressure to go down she come up if they come in front if they start to lead the way yeah like right now they they you already here they they they because they what you want to do is just make sure they chest stay out in front and now yeah initiate from there so now it when you get down to the bottom you can almost set it that way because the shoulders stay back now just initiate right from here ready to go ahead really different civilian now this is what doing the work and now when you come down it almost works automatically yeah because the doubles take you back and out you know and that watch is right here triple G anime i go ahead baby like new pushes right from there first and then when you sophisticated enough about and care enough about it that when you really oh I didn know okay there is now that you the difference you know and then you also experienced enough to seek out the discomfort that comes from doing it right because a lot of times beginners of your life like don that actually was too hard you know to the endles is back off that mesmerize call like this three sets of twelve mentality like they getting to twelve that they think it bad thing if they were to do it like right and get a great distraction and be like you know five reps in go this is awesome but I twelve yeah so they cheat it back a little bit so I can go six seven eight nine ten eleven twenty now I it bad reps you know instead if you do everyone over right it doesn what the number is as though this is how the push-ups goes if you get here okay the same thing is looking look like that supposed to push up position here my shoulder is definitely definitely in front of your chest definitely in front your you so far your chest is in front of your shoulders right you see the difference there so now you you want to get it so that that in front of the shoulders not that but out front so you can collapse a little bit through the through the back to do that now going narrower so get down to the bottom position here and put your hands just to the outside of your chest thumb should be in the lower part of your chest all right from there now your elbows will be a little bit more out inside yep like that okay tucked in this case there now so now you biceps you need your back squeeze together and then squeeze off of the ground don so I mean squeeze like try to like do this your hands are animal yeah but try that here squeeze off the ground really stick your chest out as far as you can so from there to stick it out keep it out keep it out there you go feel that yeah that so stick it out keep down stick it out deep down there that you know I can see it do by nature the other position like this is it just went back in here you know it huh yeah yeah I want in front of my shoulder my shoulder point is right here here now it put that back it want the chest in front of the shoulder so then yeah yeah so there was a push up like yeah you know just activating those muscles that are not you plane yeah the reason is because your shoulder doesn it doesn it it doesn thing that the glenoid that holds the the humerus yeah it doesn way faces like this you know case is 45 degrees forward so the arm sits naturally at this angle this is called the scapular plant here it it side you of the joint yeah so like you don to pressure in here so what you want to do is you want to get up it here and just by grabbing something in front of your body you see how the arm travels now and that in that plane you know kind of traveling in this 45 degree angle not all the way back here so things you could do from here you can load it up go to up and then one down you know to simply load it up boom here boom here or you can go which I like to do sometimes the plyometric way if you wanted to be more explosive go up and then down you know I mean like essentially loaded but look what I do when I accept it I hit page right and I don here and do that I come from here and do that here so you can do kind of a plow explosive stuff there you go it in it first that it of doing that your legs will be way stronger if you quads and I your glutes I your glute okay so now way into here you explosive is just you it and then catching it in the boom who athletic move yep there you go now obviously you load it up even in a single place yeah good answer nice about this is control your core don take you all the way over here stay in tight stay in control this last condition work out lateral raises with this thing just this is where probably the bar alone would be enough weight from here and then you there so the beauty here again is I able to do exactly what I told you before keeping it in that scapular plane yeah right I not here yeah oh this is what you still want to focus on keeping that shoulder yeah here back down so this up just like that there could do where you can kind of keep it from you know this is a really yeah when did you start wrestling would you learn bad news sprout salad my uncle used to be arrested for attempted racial identity yeah tell me about the rest are you students of course auntie Russian parts of you side this is where is meant to be kind of like a tight you know tight little bit so now you hold it in here you drop it down with a with it right and then from here you pop it up press that well I not trying to go wait out here I trying to go let it go down with a turn a pivot you know just to my just my thigh then the key is pop it easy so the key is to make it athletic make it you know make the cork stay tight yeah so go slow the point is okay drop it there boom there you go drive spin yeah just try to spin that back foot we go as you can you can put to 45 you put whatever you want on here yeah beat it you know and it position again I love the landline pork shoulder training period because it always gonna be a safe position up front yeah I didn little bit more snatch yeah but if I kept it more narrow I could get it through a cleaning okay 15 minutes but they all right so let quick let okay so we plate we do plate press outs now there a great series like if you just like hey I got a I got a blaster something for my shoulders or a good finisher yeah I can finish it at the end of some of the things we do just to make sure we killed ourselves in a more cat but you do the plate press outs and then from here now we we then from there gotta go play dates they make a figure eight on its side trap raise the trap phrase like I before face it and then we finished it out put it up by your talent all being back in bang them out yeah press it circuit all right so genders with me good [Music] [Music] 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 fun Hey [Music] [Music] [Music] they for walking through real fast just to show it to you don you shoulder clothes change good right getting that chest out setting it back all that your shoulders so you get into a box you don doing all the things we don you getting that position there and you work on it your clothes chain agility down the ladder yeah where this is back yeah and then what we do it we can kind of game apply it by having you do something plate here dumbbell and then what we do outside you started what I call a mule kick yep great another awesome a little bit more plyometric exercise you guys can all try and put what you do it again closed chain so you for this sort of flows change awesome I think it feels it feels actually stabilized yeah you do five and then you grab the first thing in this case dumbbell you just go up in it up and back so here clean it up here up mess over down up press over down to about eight of them for an inch shoulder walk yourself back down in an alley if you do with somebody else they come in they go up they come down you get back in next we can go down you do anything why the things I showed you there press house figure Eight razors come back down come back and again mule-kick spy come down and this one you do for front delt that catch you throw it catch it at 90 ok catch at 9 power because you releasing the ball so that it a try I back and let over with Oh whatare you get it ball that got the ball Yeah right there hey you guys long before you go one down nice gotta fly down 67 flat down there [Applause] [Applause] thank you thank you thank you good work this is still a lot of guys we have they don shoulder stabilization for you and makes it fun and it working out together they gives you something to beat going out you can up the ante on how many get up the ante and the exercise are doing that here you can put barbell down here if you want you do whatever you want but it do at the end of the circuit that so yeah for the master Jeff here athlean-x made me look like a child in this first day at the

WWE Jinder Mahal Workout | Assessment (PART 1)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZQtCZrvzA	ATHLEAN - X	athlean x your modern day mahar raja jingler mohon is yours there are three videos a week right this is already uh yeah you know jesse right how you doing how are you buddy good how are you yeah good thank you thank you so this oh this is nice athlete headquarters that yeah yeah and what did you do there uh so yeah i remember when it happened i was uh holding onto the rope doing uh you know those knees that i do yeah yeah i was holding onto the rope and just pulled it when it subblocks yeah and then tore it at the same time yeah yeah um and what have you done for that actually for like two three months like overhead pressed like 10 15 pounds yeah uh chest press like 25 pounds and now it same strength like three months later and no pain when you when you try no just a little bit it fatigues a little easier but no pain maybe you can see i to know absolutely yeah you got some definitely a little bit of weakness back in here you know yeah considering how up you are yeah yeah you know no pain go out more like there sides actually yeah and the wider you go the more you going to activate that but you kind of kind of know how to how to squeeze or initiate from there so the thing is is that i my muscle connection yeah it trying to literally initiate it from here right yeah exactly see the difference yeah yeah so like now go back up to the top now you might have to lighten the well here want to go right from here that initiate from there keep pushing to my fingers see the difference yeah so you pull from here wide as opposed to letting all the bigger muscles dominate which is what they trying to do anyway yeah given given any opportunity they going to dominate what you we do is go up halfway now come back down again initiate the contraction again like that all right so doubling up on contractions to get more of the work done now i could see what you already again which we we know is pulling everything out up here so you want to show you some things to do for that all the way down try to squeeze it all in our last couple inches matter yep right there now up just a few inches now do it again into there and that that that the point of that is not necessarily to try to overload you do that on your heavier set but just to try to get those muscles to be a little bit more active dislocation dislocation but uh so i yeah to label them yeah wow i absolutely so uh well first of all let talk about the track thing because what happens is as you saw there here it is i something but then the trap keeps wanting to do the job instead so it the muscles we want to work so a scout that hangs from yeah and what you do is you get up on the bar here again the first thing that people do is they sink you know into here and for a labor repair especially for a lifter one of the worst things you can do is just hang because it that wants to pull it out again so you have to at some point if you talk about you know rehabbing you have to get stabilization back in that joint instead you get up here and then you scat pull down yeah okay so then from there even when you gonna do your whole pull-ups you scat pull first and then when you i come down if i think i of it then i just have to stop re reset again and come up but if i can do it i keep it there the whole time but it becomes a lot more conscious of being able to hold right in that spot and don them you know so instead of leaning your body back try to stay straight up and down there you go and scaffolding they they strong the rest of your body is your upper body remember don the weakness we will kick in so what you instead of going here yeah when you go to scat pull you back yeah so then the round boys can go instead we want to go straight up and down so it gotta should help you out okay so yeah straight under the ball right [Music] there no pain in your shoulder right that pull up in three months really yeah because of that yeah so if you you can start to do them again and if you do it is to progress through there because your body weight yeah is going to exceed what you probably would start off over there with you know try this for a second yeah definitely a lot weaker so get up on there now just let it sink as it would normally just yeah just like that yeah now all you pull up without straight doing it bending your elbows at all just like that it inches just like that come up and right in here okay now you can do it here you want to make sure here that you staying up yeah because it substitution yeah so even just trying to do that yeah as soon as i do that i put in him at an advantage to be able to pull yeah but when i they can pullers here up and down right instead of these kind of the horizontal it that that inches yeah i can it and the same thing applies you can take it once it try to hold it now and go down into a pull down especially the way i was saying here use the muscles on the outside now when it gets back up to the top don again yep what you want to do is you want to get in here and be able to depress first okay now just that exactly even you see what happens when you do it posturally your delts get wider yeah because instead they being out and down so now when they now for a side lateral raise because normally you take them here don extend them out now that pounds that your delts are going to be doing all the work instead of your trap so take them from there extend them out good now bring them back and don traps come up keep it down the same way you work bring them in front of your chest this way turn up there you go yep grab a pair of dumbbells [Music] well it we press it front so it once it does that as soon as it starts that the chest cannot take over at that point it going to dominate the whole way yeah where the chest sinks down in instead if the chest is out and then you initiate from there you can see that right there boom it doing the it we press people do side shoulder raises like they they do this yeah you know they do that and they just they start right they start pulling up here yeah use this i usually do all right and it so i always say pretend there right here and you got to sneak your arm underneath the fence the first move is getting your arm under the fence without getting right so you right so under here and up out to the side exactly initiation can be right here feel that yeah now see if we can keep it going without letting this kick in which is good this is actually nice and loose keep going push push push more push do that this is the depth from here to here this is it this is the real estate yep so when i first initiate the contraction now yes you want to go long but the first move is not up here right which it was already every time you had to come down right but the first move out is going to be right in here feel that yeah so now it now that i got that now can i just keep pushing through there and you can the difference is that for the first time that hold it so all that tension you don yeah but when i really want to try to get an effect like a hypertrophy effect i know that ultimately i have to get as much tension into that muscle that what i build now athletically there things athletically to become better and stronger more functionally athletic yeah but you know part of your job is aesthetically looking good right so if you want to get your delts to pop and look better then you have to figure out how you can drive as much tension right there and a lot of times your delts probably never felt 15 pounds of tension directed right there yeah that yeah just like that and i could see that like it seems like delta yeah totally and then i like the one and half technique because it enforces that wait i gotta do it again yeah you know and then but you if you did this for four weeks yeah your adults would start to pop even more because they haven been able to move yet yeah i mean your shoulders are massive if you get them if you if you get your delts balancing out your traps yeah you gonna look game changer yeah yeah that did it perfectly that time you literally initiate it right with your delts and then you got to kick it again without there you go it that that but yeah if you do if you you know 10 kilograms yo elevation with any of this internal rotation is gonna especially if someone with the shoulder is gonna become more of a problem just because anatomically once you turn your arm in this is all internal rotation it doesn that people think yeah that way to do it i can do it from here to here that up here in the shoulder yeah so i internally rotate and i elevate not only that you actually stop motion so watch go as high as you can that rotated now extra turn your arm out it goes up because you yeah can you go some people go up to here you go all the way up for the front so for you it because one of the exercises i was going to show you guys with the plate is what we call a trap raise yeah it the lower trap race but if you keep going straight up now we right in there right here plate here again it all starts with the setup i start with the plate up against my thigh as it comes off my face the plate away from me so i you that way okay you plate and then you get that squeeze where i can almost feel it cramp on me in the top position yeah right there you feel it yeah and then you come down and you come down it doesn you keep everything back here as this comes out in front is there is there a point where i transferred to my front desk uh it on its own once it passes sort of this 90 degree mark yeah so remember you you are initiating from here going back a little bit now just go ahead and do your regular range keep your arms out long that yeah now from here up is usually where it starts to turn into low trap if you do it right which is now you can feel it shifting back from here yep now back down to here so for someone with scar tissue should we really try to yeah so wherever you range like pretty much like i try to avoid this range of motion but like this is where it blocks stops is that does it hurt up there no just speak of the ball you can you can you can safely go there wallet this you would call it neuromuscular re-education yeah but but honestly like this is training yeah because you can hypertrophy the out of your muscles doing this kind of training for the reasons i told you that you aren of tension into the muscles anyway [Music] you	Success

How to Fix a Bulging Disc (NO SURGERY!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKuFe2SERs	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com today I want to show you what to do for that herniated disk the bulging disc in your low back that I think probably 99% of the world has been diagnosed with I to fix it without ever having to go under the knife and I Jesse here because Jesse walked into my office one day at 22 I think yeah 22 years old and he said I can I had an MRI I got a bulging disc and my low back and I need to go have surgery I said dude you don because what I today is gonna do exactly what I showed Jesse and it of this thing once once and for all okay so what are we talking about first of all with a bulging disc when we look at a bulging disc guys there different terms that people use it herniated disc bulging disc and then a ruptured disc and a ruptured disc is a different scenario ruptured disc is win this disc here that vertebrae here just basically explodes and it that happens usually in a very traumatic incident what we often is this this is a bulging disc a herniated disc and the disc starts to protrude out the back this is what this red area is and a lot of times you can be diagnosed with a bulging disc because an MRI tells you you have a bulging disc but you don the symptoms might either be present or come and go based on whether or not that disc is actually touching the nerve if it contact in this case it wouldn the nerve touches that disc though then you start to feel the pain and the city and the tingling and the sensation down that distribution of the nerve roots so it could be in the front of your thigh if it the backyard it depends on what level and what nerve you are you touching now here that you don told Jesse not to do he just spent doing these stretches and I think that to start off I said no don stretches if you have a lumbar disc if you start doing the things that jesse is doing right here you the condition worse and a lot of people will prescribe these for you and that not what you want to do because flexing the spine bending it pulling one leg to the chest pulling both legs to the chest that the disk protrude even more so why do people tell you to do it because if you look here at the spine the muscles that run up and down these basically get tight from the spasm of trying to protect against a disc so you might stretch and feel a temporary relief but you fix the long-term cause which is the disc underneath but you are actually making it worse so instead what you want to do is you three step plan that I gave Jesse and it starts right here at the bar so the first thing if you disc is you not flex but before you do that you got to fix a couple things you want to decompress your spine and I know people use inversion tables and all that and if you don don bar so as I have Jesse first thing I tell him to do is grab the bar and then don the floor like he toes down if you can if this is too high because you set up a bar in a squat rack and at a height that you can still touch your feet to the ground but the touching of the feet to the ground is really really important because it allows you to decompress and drop your pelvis so as I reach up here I I restricting I hit flexors to hold me up but as soon as I let my toes touch now I feel like I can kind of release and what I here is I drop my pelvis and I and I obviously keeping my spine elongated so I have some space here in the spine because we want to try to create at least a little bit of room so that if that disc is touching one of the nerves we can let it off the next thing we have to do is we either go to step three or if you called a list and we need to correct that first because Step three won unless you fix step two so are you doing this are you leaning away from the pain meaning if the pain is going down your left leg are you leaning over here my left leg are you leaning over here in this direction away from the pain right and if you can easily see that in the mirror have somebody tell you if you are if you are then let wall and fix that first okay so to fix that list remember if you because you the pain then we against the so what you do is you lose the wall to your advantage if I get myself over here into the wall and I put my feet further away from the wall okay from here so that now I can take my hand on the outside and I can start to push in this direction towards the wall because what I hips and my shoulders to be level again and what that helping to centralize that disk because we don extension in step three if we haven centralized the disk because right now it away from it so if we could do this without pain then we position you do this about ten times ten or twelve times and if you find that you it feels even better the further you go you can always take like a medicine ball over here in the pillow or a sweatshirt or something and you lean into it this way okay so I got my lean here and my feet are over here but now you can see I motion that I could drive my hips through so it lot of times the over Corrections are necessary alright so now we decompression we if the list is necessary if you standing nice and tall you don necessarily need that you go right to step three which is gonna be down here on the floor alright guys so we almost there this is the last step and what you do is you want to get yourself down on the ground and we extend now we fixed the list we decompressed we actually do this thing and do it once and for all so you hands put them flat down under your shoulders but don what that matters to put your feet together contract your gluts together right get nice and tight from below take your hands here and you press up and press up only as far as you can go because you can overextend if I start to lift my hips off the ground here I low back I hips and that you only go so far as your hips will stay in contact with the ground and that about 15 or 20 seconds and then you lower yourself back down rhe contract you can see Jessi doing the same thing here as he make sure that everything stays in contact with the ground that was my one main instruction was for him and to go for just a little bit more extension each time he did it and he would find that each rep you get a little bit higher and a little bit and if it you can a really bad spot it you you can actually just get yourself in this position right here which is enough extension as it is and you can even watch TV for about 10 minutes or so if you can tolerate it just to try to get more of that extension in place to start to recapture that disk because the good thing is guys that disk 98% of the time will be able to be resent relized and recaptured and once it does and it gets off of that nerve root you going to have the problems you can be able to go back to lifting and doing the right things inside the gym without being derailed by your disc pain okay so now the last thing you can do if you had to is during the day you may not be able to lay on the ground so you can do this standing and what you want to do here is just hook your hands right I talked about in a previous video these two bumps right here on your pelvis okay you just want to get one hand on top on one side and one hand on top on the other side hook them okay and just push forward with the palms of your hands and then lean back okay the same thing though if you have to decompress first to decompress if you have to do the list against the wall you do the list but then you just lean back and you creating extension this way it a portable way to do it because you can do that anywhere guys the disc problem is a very common problem like I said almost all of us if we were I would have some sort of this problem but it doesn if it is symptomatic then there are ways to fix it you don yourself in the surgery jesse has now been a year and a half or two years since he deadlifting he been doing a lot of things to help keep it nice and strong and we in a future video too but for the meantime I wanted to make sure that I got you the way to fix it so you need to get off on your way and instead of feeling a lot better guys all of our

Pitchers...throw harder and prevent arm injury with one exercise	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vr7WTsBmb_8	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] [Music] The follow through jump out is an exercise that we use to develop and train the braking system of the shoulder. Sure, it develop the muscles that actually accelerate the shoulder and throw the ball, but just as important is to develop the muscles that slow down the shoulder and protect it. An exercise like this does just that. What we have to do is anchor tubing low to the ground about a foot or so off the ground. We start in a cocking position. So, we get ourselves to the point where we the cocking position as if we to throw a baseball. From here, we actually jump out, which is going to cause the band to be pulled back across our body. We have to resist that. Apply the brakes back here. Slow it down. So from here, we and control it. Jump and control it. You nice follow-through position, rotated towards your target. And one more time. Use a fairly thick tubing for this to get an adequate pull in that direction. If it that hard. Believe me, it [Music]	Success
Working Out with Biceps Tendonitis (DONÂT SKIP BICEPS!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHPEzjF6Qnw	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what biceps tendonitis knocking you out of the game as far as your training goes well I of all you it will take time away from your ability to train in the gym and number two the good news maybe is that it actually has nothing to do with your biceps for the most part you see your bicep training is not what predicament that you are right now it really what because if you look at the anatomy of the biceps the first thing you have to look at is as I come around the other side we have two heads of the biceps that short head that attaches here to the cor cor process and then one that attaches to the top of the ball and socket which would be the socket portion here of the shoulder joint okay so the very very top and what you have there is you can see the difference this is the long head it it versus the short head the long head though is the thing that gives us all the problems because the position of it in relation to the shoulder joint is what got this dislocated arm but you can see right on top where this rubber band is running this is the groove for the bicep tendon so the bicep tendon for the long head sits right in that Groove and then it actually gets put inside the socket and this little metal piece here I going to show you is actually kind of beneficial to what I in a second you see I happens is just like the frame of a rope over metal if I were to take this band and just keep rubbing it over this metal what do you think is going to happen over time over time it to fray break down and cause pain to become inflamed well the same thing is happening here with biceps tendonitis it curls if you look at the position of the bicep tendon during a curl it non problematic there of stretch going on here there lot of compression going on of the uh bicep tendon here because you don any elevation of the shoulder you know the only thing that would cause a problem is if you were to go into an incline curl in which case the arm would come way back here behind the body and you could see how that is going to place a lot more stretch on that tendon which could possibly already be inflamed but generally that doesn until after it not causing the inflammation in the first place so what of your problem probably a lot of your other exercises that involve anything with your shoulder over your head particularly those that have elements of bicep contribution too so things like a chin up if you arms going to be up here elevated over shoulder height and then you have the superation here of your wrist so you this position now you activation of the biceps but with a compression here of the bicep tendon because guess what happened when you lifted this up and lifted your arm up you compressed it you left not much space here inside to for the for the tendon to actually exist without banging up against the other bones above it okay the chromium namely so what you need to do is consider what other exercises could do that well a bench press can do the same thing if your elbows are out here to the side you have that elevation and of course even a squat can do the same thing because you external rotation with an elevated arm that so it doesn necessarily your bicep exercises but more so with the healthier shoulders so how do you fix it or how do you combat it you got to start looking at your shoulders and the only thing that going to help you to keep the position of this shoulder in place without allowing it to migrate too far up to pinch this tendon every single time is the strength of your rotator cuff I talked about so many times on this channel and there done dedicated to the rotator cuff and how to train the rotator cuff that allows this head of the humoris here to stay down enough space here so that when I elevate it it the roof here causing the pinching of this Rotator of this long head of the biceps and causing it to Fray Over time as I go back and forth back and forth back and forth I have to be able to keep this depressed as I Elevate so that that bicep tendon isn and sort of worn down every time I raise my arm up over my head scapular work is be uh going to be just as important as well like I said I have lots of videos devoted to how to strengthen the rotator cuff on this channel you can link to those and find those as well but the idea here is you can the source of pain and say hey this is what the problem is as a matter of fact you would not stop training your biceps if you had a bicep 10 nus as long as you keeping your arm down here in a regular uh traditional curl uh position so you want to start looking elsewhere and understanding how the body works and intertwines together I try to do that in our athx training system by putting the science back in strength right we been doing this for a long time guys I and I break out the visuals for you to help you to understand why something is happening so that you things because someone tells you to do it but you understand why you all over at aex.com our whole athletex training system like I said breaks it all down day byday work workout by workout in the meantime if you found this video helpful make sure to leave your comments and thumbs up below and if you can probably get back to training those biceps a little bit more

WORST Shoulder Exercise (WATCH IT TEAR A SHOULDER MUSCLE!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw3r2lytys8	ATHLEAN - X	what another athl Express video this time breaking out our good friend here welcome to the anatomy lab I show you today exactly why the behind the neck shoulder press should be avoided at all costs I you exactly why with him in the meantime I don going to start appearing in a lot more of our videos to help you guys learn the concepts I a name for him down below the best name will win meantime let action I different versions of the shoulder press and then break down on him why one is far superior than the other okay so as you can see on the traditional behind the neck shoulder press the thing I want you to notice guys is the position of the elbows in the frontal plane what I mean is this plane right here on the side behind the neck press you that the elbows are pointing directly at you as I do the press in the side by side here you can see how they stay in that plane all the way up okay up and down I skeleton why that we want to do the Press right we have to get those elbows forward we got to put them in what we call the scaff their plane again I important on the skeleton but the elbows have to come forward about 30° so that when you the bar still travels obviously up and over my head but the the elbows are angle towards you guys here as opposed to here you can elbows here you certainly can all right all right so again side by side you can see the two different variations in the Press I prove to you exactly why one is again far superior all right guys so let step into the lab here you first of all for the guys that said Jeff you don smile enough this guy will be doing more smiling for you than you will ever imagine matter of fact that smile will never change I promise you but let look right here there want to show you on this skeleton number one we of the joint you can see right here that this is the ball and socket joint here the ball here is facing me right here at this angle which is 30° again from the frontal plane from the exact side of him right the key point there guys is that it not facing this way so when the ball tries to move inside the socket it moves naturally in this direction which again is a 30° forward arm placement it moving out here it so that I to explain just what impact that has on the rotator cuff in the uh the tendons in your shoulder all right now let take a look at the important thing as we move the shoulder up right as we Elevate our arm here in this scapular plane right the angle of the the bone is forward here you can see that this muscle here this is the attachment of the supanan the rotator cuff muscle that it come all the way up even as we come all all the way up to the top there clearance here it the the the roof of the joint here the AC chromium on top of the shoulder okay Watch What Happens though when we take the arm out to the side if we take the arm up and out to the side first of all you and then when you elevate it look how much that tendon gets slammed into the roof of the chromium that is impingement guys that there as I raise this arm up I don care if you don hurting you now that you this exercise for a couple years and it doesn grinding over and over and over and over and over and over again is going to eventually wind up catching up to you and remember there if you can progress is only made when you healthy enough to actually step foot in the gym all right guys so there you have it another athlet Express tip for you he felt bashful I took off the shirt so he wouldn the important thing is we the anatomy if we have to we will put the science back in strength if that what it takes to get you guys to start training the right way right first and foremost I want you to train safe but I can tell you when you train safe you allow your muscles to work the way they joints at all cost you will start lifting more you will start seeing better results and that is all about if you guys have not already come on board then do me a favor head to athletex dcom right now check out what we have over there it 90-day training system it puts the the science back and strength to allow you guys to get bigger faster and stronger by training the right way putting biomechanics back into the equation and letting you train the way I feel you supposed to all right guys leave your thumbs up in a comment below again a name for this guy he doesn yet if I do pick your name I sure to acknowledge you down here in a future video of course	Success
Rotator Cuff Killer (SHOULDER LATERAL RAISES!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5sNYB1Q6aM	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] What x.com. Today we the dumbbell side lateral raise to see exactly how you this, at least if you want to have longevity in the gym and get your shoulders to grow at the same time. My biggest problem with this exercise is going to fly contradictory to what most people will ever tell you about how to perform the exercise, but I promise you I will justify the reason why I tell you how to do it. Okay, the one that you see, the one that people will tell you to do all the time is if you want to target the medial head of your shoulders, you have to act like you pouring pictures of water. So, at the top of the exercise, you should feel as if you Okay? They say that in order to activate your medial delt, you have to have internal rotation of your shoulder, which is accomplished by having your pinky up higher than your thumb. Does that produce internal rotation of your shoulder? 100% yes, it does. Is that a good thing for you to do? Especially when you as a physical therapist, professional athletes, especially baseball players, and anybody that has to throw overhead, that is a horrible position for them. And not just them, but it also. Because over time, is this going to get you right now in the next workout that you do? No. Is it going to get you over time? 99 times out of 100. In fact, you don you repetitively do this motion, internal rotation with elevation of the shoulder, you breakdown almost every single time. Again, the variation in the time it takes to cause the breakdown is going to change from person to person. It might take 20 years in one person. It might take two months in somebody else. It all depends upon the shape of your own anatomy inside your shoulder. But that motion combination is not a good thing. Why do they tell you to do that? Well, I not not even one of its first four functions is it to internally rotate the shoulder. That It has many other primary functions. Not among them is internal rotation of the shoulder. So, doing this is not really part of the main function of the medial delt. So, why would I be told to do this? It actually broke out the marker to show you what self and get on my medial delt. Now, here, this is representing the medial deltoid. Here, we have the front delt in the right in through here. And then we here. But in here, I as best as I could the medial delt when I stand upright. And let decent posture. If I getting ready to do a side lateral raise, when I raise my arm up to the side here, again, right in this frontal plane, look at the position of the medial delt. You can see it backwards. Okay? It We know from some of our other videos here, putting the science back in strength that in order to really work a muscle optimally, you want to have it perpendicular to the line of force. And we know the line of force is going to act down on our arm here, which is gravity. And for the medial delt to be positioned ext, you know, right perpendicular to uh gravity here, we know that when we do this, we actually getting not really absorbing that full line of force. So if we internally rotate our shoulder, okay, it has nothing to do with wrist positioning, guys, cuz I could actually take my arm and just turn my wrist, but nothing in my shoulder. That of the shoulder joint. That rotation. Okay? This is just pronation supernation of your forearm. So we talking about actual internal rotation. That pitcher of water. If I do that now when my arm is down, okay, now you can see I position that gravity. So now when I come up, now you can see that at the very top it is taking on the brunt of the force of gravity coming down. The problem with this is again it leads to the impingement issues that I already told you about over time. Again, some people it it repetitions. A lot of times guys will use lighter weights when they do their side lateral raises anyway which can lend itself to a lot of repetitions. Okay. So what we want to do is we want to do the opposite. We want to externally rotate our shoulder to clear the head of the humorris from the acchromium which is the bone inside the shoulder that winds up compressing against the suppinatus tendon which is what gets pinched in there when we have impingement. Impingment is by far the number one malady when it comes to shoulders and the injuries that guys face when they competitive athletes or again even just in the in the in the sport of life. Guys out there who for a living have to put their arms up over their head a lot. that position will cause the impingement right there in that super spanas tendon. So, we can do something better if we externally rotate the shoulders. If we go the opposite way and we say, worry about doing pooring the pitchers, but turn your hands the other way. Externally rotate the shoulder. Not that, but that. Guess what? We already cleared the humorus now and gotten rid of 99% of the impingement problems that could come from that exercise. And all you have to do is make a real simple switch in your posture to make sure that we muscle against gravity. And it simple as this. Lean forward just a little bit. Now that I little bit, when I externally rotate my arm here, you can see that I still have this squarely against the force of gravity here. So I a thumb up position at the top as opposed to internal rotation, thumbs down. and I the force right there on the medial delt. It makes a lot of sense and it just a smarter way to do it. Can you do them the oldfashioned way? Can you continue to pour your pictures? Bang. Go for it, guys. I don It it. I therapist standpoint, understanding the anatomy of the shoulder. You better off. It still get the benefits of the exercise, to still stimulate the medial delt if you without having to have the concerns of doing the exercise in a position that your shoulders just don because of the the um because of the anatomy of your own shoulder joint. How was that, guys? I you, there to understand when you approach your training. And not understanding them can lead to a world of hurt. And it all all the time something that you going to feel and pop and it happen right away. But if we we should be in this for the long haul. You should be looking to train for a long time. That at Athlete X. Putting the science back in strength. So this is not just a short-term sprint, but helping you to get results for a lifetime because a lot of guys that wind up starting this wind up loving this and they continue to see results. They want to train for a long time and stay healthy for as long as they possibly can. Guys, I mentioned Major League Baseball. We actually have a joint formula that Major League Baseball players are taking right now. Actually, some of the best teams in baseball currently in first place are taking athlete mechanics. It NS-certified product. It athletrx.com. If you dealing with joint problems because maybe you wrong way for a long period of time, you might be able to start having an opportunity to start fixing what on in there and get back to the game again and start training again the way you want to.

How to Bench Press WITHOUT Pain - Reverse Grip Bench!!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clBGsv573K4	ATHLEAN - X	have shoulder problems taking the benchpress out of your chest building Arsenal and then show you today then might not have to be the case by giving you two options what cavaliere athleanx.com the bench press it building your chest but if you have shoulder problems like a lot of guys do it could be one of the hardest exercises for you to do why is that the case well let me show you first what the problem is with the bench press and how the shoulders can be aggravated with this exercise but then give you two alternatives that you can use first and foremost we this channel the shoulders being put in in a vulnerable position when you doing a lot of different weight training exercises a lot of that is because especially like an upright row that because of the position of the shoulder the internal rotation of the shoulder and when we internally rotate the shoulder we don inside this shoulder joint for all the things that need to fit in there okay all the tendons all the ligaments all the bones that need to fit in this ball and socket and work optimally so when we look at the benchpress when we this position it really is not far different than the upright row internal rotation position there internal rotation going on in the shoulder so we get back down here and do an actual benchpress this position here just because I land on my back is no different than if I was standing up and still be the same internal rotation position as we take the bar up and then bring it down okay I always tell you guys if you okay the extra inches that you go to go all the way down to your chest all that does is tilt your scapula forth further forward and drive your shoulder more into internal rotation even if you trying to pinch your shoulder blades together the weight down here mechanically is going to tilt forward and cause this to go into further internal rotation so much so as you can actually get an AC joint problem which I my shoulders here this bump came from me doing one bench press incorrectly to my chest and it popped the AC joint this side I that it still bothers me from time to time so what can we do we can do what I just said stop it a little bit above the chest so that you extra couple inches that aren worth your time guys I promise you still get the benefits of the exercise but not have to put the danger at the AC AC joint so or we can do the reverse grip bench press now how does that change things because we remember internal rotation is this in this right internal external at the shoulder internal external okay the same thing or internal external it what here so if I twist internal rotation of this bone if I open it external rotation more space okay same thing here internal rotation external rotation so warm room we get into this position underhand we external rotation way more room inside the shoulders so those guys that have blocking shoulder joints are gonna find this to be much easier so we grab it with about index fingers on the smooth part okay and we push the bar into the lower part of our palm okay we be have your hands almost tilted a little bit over the top of the bar to start because then when I push it up they wrist will be in neutral not really bent back here so you wrist damage or anything like that so more of a neutral grip so again over the top and then we lift up and then from here again neutral grip going on the wrist other and let my elbows dip down into my sides I can go a little lower here because I have that extra room and then I squeeze up okay down to the sides and then squeezed up a lot of guys like this variation because they get a better squeeze on their chest and squeeze down and squeeze again no pain in the shoulders especially for guys that are used to having it so the bench press doesn routine completely if you have bad shoulders you just have to approach your exercise a little bit different and that ever disappoint my physical therapy background with what it is that I show you guys here I know I to do a lot more of these PT type videos because you guys have been asking form but in athlean-x what we try to do in our system is basically you know push all these ideas through to your everyday training so that you are training smarter I always want you to train harder but your training smarter at the same time so you can continue to get results for many many months in years to come as opposed to doing something incorrectly and being laid up like I was when I screwed up my shoulder a long time ago if you guys like this or if you try the reverse grip leave your comments below let me know and of course let me know what you want to see because I getting a lot of my ideas based on your questions and your feedback I guys over at athleanx.com in the meantime back here in just a couple days with another video [Music]	Success
How to Fix Your Posture (NO MORE ROUNDED SHOULDERS!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2VQ_WZ8Bto	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com a little viewer participation in today you to right now to stand up and put your arms at your sides and I want to see how you so arms at your sides standing up now what direction are your thumbs pointing are they pointing towards each other or they pointing straight ahead now most guys I especially if you lift your thumbs are going to be pointing towards each other or at least they and the problem is guys too much internal rotation at our shoulders what causes that a lot of the lifting and concentrating on all the muscles in front of us with an inattention to the muscles in the back now I you you rhomboids in the inter scapular muscles enough to counteract all that heavy work that you is it supposed to feel well the way it supposed to feel we could do that with a band so you take one of the athlean elastics bands you one end over the other so you basically got a little figure right here okay then you fold the band in half so essentially we gonna get a little tricky I mean I definitely recommend you do this with a shirt on I want to show you what the difference is so you can see what going on so I take the beating you put it over one shoulder let my better shoulder so put it over one shoulder okay now you back and through here and get your arm all the way around okay so you kind of wear it almost like a backpack now from here again I would have recommended it a t-shirt but for here you can see right away it corrected my posture chest is out shoulders are back and if I rest my hands down they naturally want to rest now with my thumbs pointing forward this feels great unfortunately I don way okay so the problem is by me not walking around this way with my shoulders in the right in the right position they have a lot of impact on what we do when we train if your shoulders are rounded forward we showed you in past videos that gonna limit the mobility literally bone-on-bone mobility preventing you from getting your shoulders fully up over your head it to drag down if your upper spine is chaotic and rounded forward that means that your mid spine is going to be kind of annika rounded forward to because it start walking around with worse and worse posture it effect on your abs it your hip flexors there that cascade off of not being able to stay in the right posture so what do we do well first thing is going to get myself out of this bring a band to show you and with myself on the way out of it you take this same man and you do band pull up arms and they you dictate your own resistance by just grabbing on okay taking your thumbs pointing them towards each other and then pulling them apart and rotating your thumbs back in out so you just getting a pull apart here and I show you what it looks like again why I do it you retraction you rotation because you thumbs towards the back behind you you rotating up through the shoulder so again if I want to start really easy I just grab the band about shoulder width I pull it apart and I pull my thumbs back and apart they each other they me okay so again pointing towards each other pointing back behind me towards each other back behind you when I actually come in I letting it snap there then there you center contraction of those same muscles that we actually squeeze them back and then we decelerate them in we squeeze them back and then we decelerate them in here the recommendation in terms of buying you didn took you a long time and a lot of reps to get here these muscles are more postural nature I told you before about out training more frequency is going to benefit you more than trying to do low volume and going really intense so I recommend you get a band and you carry it with you and you make it become have it especially if you struggling from this you know you have bad posture do this a few times at work bang out 50 reps in the morning bang out 50 reps near lunch doing when you just thinking try to work on that posture I lower intensity but the volume is going to really really help to start counteracting what a very simple tip for you guys but you can see the importance of getting it right I talk about all the time guys if you want to look like an athlete you got to Train like an athlete that means it not just everything we do here and it doesn a sport it means you have to start paying attention to the small things you have to start realizing that everything matters when your body is a kinetic chain and you have to function whether it be athletically or dysfunction in the real world you have to make sure that everything in that kinetic chain is working you can other sure we all want bigger biceps bigger chest but you can other things because eventually that going to carry over to those things as well and bring you down do you want a complete training program that addresses everything and overlooks nothing then head to athleanx.com right now and grab our 90-day training program if you found this tip helpful make sure you give it a try tell me admit it if your thumbs are pointing towards each other and let me know what else you make sure I do that all right guys we be back here again in just a couple days you	Success
How to Run (SAFER, FASTER, WITHOUT PAIN!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=entUXhcgt3c	ATHLEAN - X	are you running your way right into bad knees a bad lower back in Achilles tanus we most importantly I what to do to fix [Music] it what x.com today we running now even you guys that have the athenex program that do our burst training you know what a role running plays in our high-intensity interval training and you know that we feel that the long distance Marathon type running not the best not the most conducive to building muscle or preserving muscle at that matter but at the same time guys there and even from running fast and that is running can do damage to your joints especially if you on where you running so in this video what I wanted to do is talk to you guys about the different Landing positions and what they mean and what they could be doing to the rest of your body so with that said the three places that you generally Landing when you run are either on your heel now there evidence that look they looked at some of the top runners in the world 90% of runners run on their heels meaning when they strike the ground their heel hits first out in front of their body okay the second type of Runner is the tow Runner a lot of sprinters will claim that they run on their toes that good good thing but they that actually land out here up on their toes the third place that people could run that they often don least represented of those three positions is on the midfoot the midfoot is when all toes are on the ground but you still have your heel off the ground now I want you to try a quick test whether or not you know where you run again most likely if you had to guess you on that evidence of the fact that most of people that run do run on their heels but I want you to do a quick test for me even with your shoes on I want you to pick your toes up and jump up and down a few times okay first of all not only should you have a complete lack of spring in your step but it should kind of jolt the whole lower body you should feel the jolt every time your heels hit that goes right through your heels up through your ankles into your knees and even I feel it right here my low back and hips that should tell you something that when you land on your heels you completely lack shock absorption now think about if you do that every single step when you run for miles and miles and miles there lot of stress going up through your body that cause a bad problem uh over a long term into your low back and the rest of your your knees and ankles on the other hand if you go up on your toes and you jump up and down on your toes I extreme toes way up here as high as you can go feels better feels a lot more springy but the fact of the matter is here we sort of over utilizing and over stressing our Achilles tendon right this is basically a cap phrase and if we land in that contracted position over and over and over and over again we lot of stress on that tendon which again can lead to issues over time breakdowns of our Achilles tendon in terms of tended eyes so if we were to ideally want to be someplace where we wanted to land it would be right there on the balls of your feet and any way that has done again our burst training workouts where we Advocate jumping rope you right there guys in the balls of your feet you have the perfect combination of shock absorption and spring cuz as you land you can absorb that blow and then you can propulse yourself right back up off of your feet so now let that in terms of running when we run guys if we know that the ideal place to be is here on the balls of our feet you you don front of your body as a matter of fact when you put your heel out in front of your body you leg and you with the front leg think about that as this heel hits the ground is basically saying whoa hold on a second stop decelerate and then you do it all over again where this one Jeff go right this is pushing this is stopping it what you don the ground causes a big Force to go right up through that leg and cause problems so the main key is we want to make sure that when that foot lands that it so instead of the foot look the leg going to go out in front of you there no doubt your leg is going to pass out in front of you but where are you landing and if you can see right here as I land I land on the ball of my feet right here with my foot underneath my hip but there the last piece of the puzzle here guys is you want to lean your trunk forward especially as you start to run faster you leaning like this okay they leaning towards the Finish Line they leaning like this throughout their run they do that to get their Center gravity more forward to allow themselves as they come down to again get that foot right up underneath their hip the last key point I lied I said the other one was the last key point the main focus you should have guys you should not have quiet glutes when you run your glutes should be actively pulling your leg back you should feel as if you the ground to actually Propel yourself forward it this you flexors to run you to drive the leg back against the ground use the friction between your foot and surface of the ground to push you to the next the next step and again when that lands it underneath you you and you go on so start concentrating on where you Runner you with your leg out in front of you no good because again you going to cause yourself some knee problems now there is one indication here if you guys are Runners and you have a lot of knee pain and you want to get a rid of that knee pain you to want to become again more of a more of a toe Runner more towards the toe midfoot would be best but get more towards the toe if you dealing with Achilles tendinitis right now and every time you run you feel it you your heel now again the best part is in the middle but you if one thing if you can do one thing to make that feel better today it to be to get more towards the heel if all of your pain is Achilles tendonitis when you run all right but the idea is we want to get you in the center where you ingrain that by using the right mechanics when you run all right guys I hope you found this helpful I get a lot of requests here on running type videos whether you are a long distance Runner or whether you are a sprinter doing the type of high-intensity training and running that I believe you should be doing it doesn mechanics are going to be the same and you have an eye on what you sure you process of trying to get healthy if you guys want a complete program where we just don incorporate weight training and flexibility and the right nutrition and everything combined and that athletex program guys and that we train athletically and where I coach you guys uh as if you all right and we can get that over at athletex docomo what type of Runner are you and make sure above all else you try that drill CU as soon as you try to do the three different Landing positions you see right away where you should be all right guys we another video [Music]	Success
Top 3 Rotator Cuff Exercise Mistakes (FIX YOUR SHOULDER PAIN!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1hIHwLsiq8	ATHLEAN - X	what rotator cuff exercises by now you should know how important they are if you watching our channel for any length of time you realize how important they are you see most poorly written workout programs have such an imbalance between the number of exercises that internally rotate our shoulders versus those that externally rotate our shoulders that is no surprise that we so many guys that wind up with shoulder pain from working out but it doesn have to be that way but if you understand that you have to do your shoulder external rotation exercises that because a lot of times what we is we three big mistakes that people will make when they exercises their external rotation exercises and I think we need to address them here today so we that you when we do our external rotation you have to make sure that you keeping your elbow tucked tight to your side as tight as you possibly can if you have to you put a towel up under your arm to reinforce that now why the towel because the mistake is when people go do this they try to cheat and get a little bit more room in a little bit more motion so they let their elbow drift away from their body What Here is they rotator cuff in isolation anymore now they to the exor rotation and a lot of times what will happen is the deltoid will take over and dominate so it becomes more of a side lateral raise the towel will drop on the floor the minute you do that though that have it as visual feedback the reason why that in general is supposed to keep the heavy humorous centered inside of the glenoid so inside the ball in socket you supposed to have a centrally located ball as you raise your arm up whether it be through an overhead press or a side side lateral raise or a front dumbbell raise that head needs to stay in the middle of the joint so you don migration upwards that can cause a banging into the through the roof of chromium there in a pinching of that rotator cuff tendon which will lead to that impingement if you have the deltoid doing all the work all you contributing more and more to the problem because the deltoid in the first place wants to pull the head of the humoris up the only muscles we have that counteract that upper pull and keep it centrally located are those boring old three little rotator cuff muscles so let them do the job in the first place let them actually work the second mistake that we have to consider in fix is the position that we have with our upper body when we do the exercises you see any external rotation exercise is great but not if you posture you see if you have rounded shoulders like this you completely negated all the freedom you balance of in strength in the rotator cuff muscles in the first place see try this quick test with me get yourself into bad posture allow your shoulders to round forward let your shoulder blades round around protract around your body get your should your shoulders rounded forward exaggerated now take your arm and try to raise it as high as you possibly can this is it this is as far as I can go before it mechanically gets blocked it of the acromium here inside my shoulder joint now if I put my shoulder blades in my back pocket all things will change now by just setting my shoulder blades like I said down and back you want to let them be tight up against your rib cage when I do that now I raise my arm up I actually allowed the roof that was leaning forward here and block the head of the humorus to now sit back so now that humorus can come up and actually move freely inside that socket the third and final mistake is actually related to the second one and that is an inattention to the other half of the equation here what is the actual shoulder blade doing we just covered how important the position of the shoulder blade is to the overall function of the shoulder joint so if you about the position of your shoulder blade at any point in time then you really ignoring a main key component of the goal of your shoulder rotation exercises so we need to fix that we need to realize that two muscles will actually really position the shoulder blade where we want it to be that back down to your back pocket position that going to be your seratus anterior and your lower trap we can actually train these two muscles very very easily and with very little extra work in your workout here I plus and it slight tweak I have my arms and my forearms on the ground and I have them Palms up with my shoulders uh and elbows in and my hands and forearms out a little bit to get a little extra rotation into my shoulders and from here I from my arms keeping everything nice and tight and fixed we protraction of the shoulder blades around my body and I push away but again leave everything nice and tight and stable the seratus interior is what that work there and it the shoulder blade nice and tight here as you can see on our skeleton nice and tight to the rib C cuz you need that stability down the second thing we need to do is work on the lower trap so that we can get the proper rotation of the shoulder blades because when we raise our arm up there a huge amount of rotation that by the shoulder blade to do that if your shoulder blad stayed fixed you get your arm up about 2/3 of the way so you need to make sure that you getting a rotation of the shoulder blades and it has to stay tight to your rib cage so you can do some of the exercises I can actually be done two different ways is either using a bar or using equipment but it me hanging from a pull-up bar it natural upper rotation that here from the pull-up position right as I have my arms up and hanging over my body but I want to just try to pull my body up without allowing my elbows to bend but now we from the and contribution from the lower traps to help develop some strength and stability into the scapular component of that glenohumeral joint I can do the same thing in uh with a cable like in a lap pull down setup where I that real bottom position there keeping my arm straight the whole time you don have to do a lot of these guys you just got to make sure you and you do the work and that it matter of fact we have ways that we combine the rotator cuff into the exercises that we normally do we realize that this big overreliance on internal rotation in most programs is not going to cut it and that therapist I put together the athlex training system so it getting you big and strong we I promise you but we way that we protect your joints and help you get there safely guys if you looking for a program to build muscle but at the same time realize and respect the longevity that comes with it so that we can actually do this for a long time then head to athl x.com and get our athletex training system in the meantime if you found this video helpful make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below and we right

Bench Press Shoulder Pain (INSTANT RELIEF!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snFvEucPkGw	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com so the dumbbell bench press is by far one of the most important foundational exercises that you can do and it of those that you know you should do but what happens that when you try to do it and your shoulder kills you when you do it it saying should I continue to do this because it hurt me so bad I that if the root of your problem is a bicep tendonitis which is a lot of times it is I you can instantly fix that today by changing the positioning of your arms during the movement and I why it actually works now there are a lot of people that will say that a bicep tendon is now of course the only reason why your shoulder will hurt during a benchpress a lot of times it could be from an instability of your infraspinatus or other rotator cuff muscles that are providing you with an imbalance in a lack of stability when you go to press and we know that stability or a stable surface when you try to press off of it is extremely important it vertical jump test from a pillow you wouldn to change the positioning here of our elbows during the benchpress so typical bench press is done this way here elbow is about 45 degrees from out here and tucked into our body so right about here and we okay now what I feel especially now because I have a labrum issue which is intimately involved with the biceps tendon because it basically attaches to the portion of my labor and that so any tension through the bicep is going to pull on my torn labrum but you could just have an isolated bicep tendon tear inflammation what we have is we gotta start trying to figure out how we can sort of shut down the bicep tendon a little bit during the press so all we have to do is sort of push the bottoms of the dumbbells here up towards the ceiling okay so what I did was I took them from this level position to a bottoms-up or pinky up positioning what it did is it does two things first of all it takes my arm and it goes from here to here so I just kind of dropped my arm in front a little bit created a little bit more space a little bit more of a neutral position inside of the shoulder and also almost the equivalent of doing a shoulder press we usually do it over here I tell you how the landmine setup actually helps to alleviate a lot of pain we same thing there but more importantly what it I tricep here during the press and immediately the pain that I feel in my shoulder when I press from here is gone and you try it yourself and you to feel it yourself you pain-free bench pressing for the first time in a long time and it what we the activation of the triceps just a little bit because we bit more elbow flexion going on here than we did we were like this okay you could hardly see it from there but the idea is the elbows are bending more so there will reciprocally inhibit the muscle on the other side of the joint so if we can activate the triceps we will turn off the biceps reciprocally and that will take some of the tension off of this and in my case it won so much on the the torn labrum or in your case if you have this sort of biceps tendinitis or inflammation it will activate it to a lesser degree so it won stabilize as much that pain that you get associated with that will go away so if you presses remember you have two options in the beginning you could ditch the back of the doing bench press all together because you can have to lighten the weight substantially in this case you stick with your heavier weights and you exercise if you found this video helpful guys make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below I know it bit wordy at times in terms of the PT side of it but we science back in strength so that you not just learning the fix but you knowing why the fix works because that going to make it stick for a lot longer it makes sense to you if you for a program that puts the science back in strength for ninety straight days literally takes you by the hand rep by Rep workout by workout and meal by meal head to athleanx.com and get our athlean-x training system if you found this video helpful make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know whatever else you want to see I bring them to you in the days and weeks ahead I you	Success
How to Squat with Knee Pain - SQUAT FIX!! (Knee Pain No More!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBq6iynRUUE	ATHLEAN - X	did you get any pain when squatting I going to show you today it stop blaming the knees and start looking elsewhere what athleanx.com a midweek video what do you know right this is sort of a an idea I had in my mind for quite some time was what if we started to put out a couple more videos what if we did two a week now if you guys like that idea let me know below and even drop some of the ideas that you start making some of those videos that being said I thought today was a great chance to talk about a real common issue put on my physical therapy hat and talk about something that I see come in front of me all the time almost 90% of time with athletes that I train his knee pain hardly anybody can get through leg workouts without having some sort of knee pain but the big factor here is what are you blaming on most Gaudens say I have bad knees the fact of the matter is the knee joint itself is sort of what I call a consequential joint meaning it of the ankle in the hip and has to deal with the consequences that those two joints can do to epidemic okay that that really there train on a track the knees sits in the middle of the train track and it sort of if the track is messed up the track is messed up because the ankles moving it or the hip is moving it out of whack so when we squat one of the problems I think most guys have is a big issue up here in the hip not having the right mechanics of the hip in order to stabilize and allow the knees to track in line the way they should so my best tip when you knee pain almost instantly you you do this tip you can get you squat regularly you you do a squat with this you should feel the pain significantly go away if not totally you and start by getting your elbows pointed downward what this does is it sort of acts to stabilize the mid-back which set up and make it easier to stabilize the low back right we kinetic chain here so by digging the elbows down and into our sides we have already stabilized the upper back mid back the tip is at the time that it comes to going to your descent you gonna pull down into the descent you going to actively contract your hip flexor your psoas muscle to get you down into that so what does that mean before you do a rep if you were to push up here on your hand you as if you what the activation of the psoas feels like you that so not only by pulling down with the hip flexors are you going to stabilize the hips but you to get other muscles out of it so let me demonstrate what I get under here okay the first thing I do is dig my elbows down into my sides okay head is up elbows dug down and here and then I actively downward into the squat so I activate the hip flexors down and then I come back up okay iceweasel down and then I come up okay again damn it up so what I that that active contraction what it does is it gets the leg fire in the way it should the the knee can track where it has to and we don like the tensor fasciae and all these other muscles on the outside of the thigh to kick in and artificially which is what and stabilize because it stability somewhere the problem is the TfL is going to come in and pull the knee out of whack not in the direction it means to stay so the second benefit when you actively pull down think about yourself as loading a spring when you pull down you they can unload and actually help to propel you out of the bottom position of the squat so you with spring have that concept of your to low the spring come out of it one final tip if you have a hard time feeling the sensation of pulling down you want to set up a couple bands in the slot rack reach up here and grab them okay okay grab them up high now in order to get down into the squat I actively pull so I pull the band with the hip flexor contractions pull down pull that pull down by pulling down into the hip flexors I push my butt out behind me I get the knees from cracking too far over the toes and I stabilize the back because the hip flexors so it attaches back here in the lower back as soon as you contract it it stabilizes all the lumbar segments here so that I in a good position to go so guys start trying this put this into action do it without a bar go there if you have knee pain do your traditional squat then try to actively contract as you go down right here through the hip flexors if you want to see what that feels like try a band or just hold your leg up and actively contract your hip up to see with that Kitab what that contraction feels like so you can reproduce it when you get into the bar guys like I said if you like especially if you like some of these more we call them the nerdy videos but it you strength if you like this let us know tell us some of the other issues you want to see us cover and I right now I a week so guys if you haven you watched our trance martyr and harder head over to athleanx.com and grab the 90-day training program it just

Low Back Pain Relief (ONE MOVE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZcOAQoE81A	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what athletic.com today I help you to get rid of that low back pain once and for all you see you got to start understanding what low back pain in the first place to really be able to conquer it and I think a lot of times the advice that people that suffer from back pain get is just misdirected is misguided they at the location of the pain without actually looking for the source of the pain and unless you get to the source you pain once and for all so today I to show you an exercise that you want to start doing and I different levels of progression depending upon how acute your back pain is okay now first of all if you dealing with a really bad back that doesn moment you gym exercising what you be doing is allowing that to heal calm down control the inflammation if you beyond that though it chronic problem keeping you out of the gym or making your Gym training sessions uncomfortable then you got to start with an exercise start training those weak spots 99% of the time what back pain is a weakness in a joint below that in this case going to be the hips it that are basically putting you in the position to be compromised in your low back so what we do is we have a setup here and in this setup you can see all I need is a barbell and a band and the band I have anchored to the back of this squat rack okay however you anchor it I have it on the back of some pins so now I behind the the the band and I going to worry necessarily about the bar just yet especially again if this is something that you acute stage but you still have quite a bit of back pain and weakness okay so you get yourself into the band you just walk forward it kind of blocks your progression into the cage now what you want to do is you want to position the band right across the kind of crease that happens right here in your hips okay because the first thing it wants to do is teach you what a hip hinge is cuz most of us that have weak backs don really know how to hinge correctly so it would feel like here moving me into this position here okay so it me back is when I let the resistance take over it pulls me back into a proper hip hinge it bending me right at those creases here at the top of my hips if I were to put this higher like against my stomach and I lean forward right allow this to take me back it actually has me fold over the band right now I flex position which is going to C problems for us that have low back pain so first thing up here now I walk forward now all I do is I allow it to hinge me and then I come back against the resistance of the band squeezing my glutes as hard as I possibly can and also extending here staying up nice and Tall to extend through the low back so now we the low back which are supposed to work together they they direction we need them to be able to work and concert with each other most of us don the low back tries to accomplish that okay the other thing you could see that would happen is if I don ability to extend because I don strong glute so I can to have this posture where I fall forward okay because I through the hips more I fall forward the more responsibility is taken over by the low back and that but you know what doing that 24 hours a day minus our sleeping time that much work for the low back to do alone it needs the help of the glutes so get your ass to start working literally so now what we do is we can work on one side or the other if I straddle here one leg in front and I let it pull me back then I drive forward let it pull me back then I squeeze forward what you to find is the leg that dropped back is doing all the work so if I stare it this way it like this hinge squeeze forward it will work my right side hinge squeeze forward I love this extension because it closed to chain it we which is predominantly on our feet okay so down into the hinge and then squeeze forward right here through the glute now you want to make it a little bit more difficult if you have a healthier back but one that you know is weak now you can start tying in an RDL to it so that down we got the bar we walk forward just a little bit okay right here against the resistance into the band now I allow it to hinge me down to knee height maintaining that arch of my low back and I drive forward and I use my glutes here to squeeze forward down drive forward see at the top of this exercise we normally wouldn resistance but because the band is in place here I still have a lot of resistance now being applied to the glutes now last modification if you really want to start taking this to the next level you do this come down hinge bent row here now drive forward hinge bent row here now drive forward now we lumbar spine well hips then lumbar spine then thoracic spine obviously because I got to maintain extension through there too and they pull so there you have but now you have a weapon in Your Arsenal to start attacking that back pain of yours at its source remember stop just looking for the location of the pain and start trying to find the actual source of the pain you of it once and for all you can if you and trying to treat the symptoms okay this is just another example guys of how we put the science back in strength you got to peel away the layers a little bit to get to the bottom of what going on the human body is pretty complex we got to be smarter than it to be able to solve its problems and back pain is one of the biggest ones we have to deal with on a daily basis guys if you found this

Bench Press Pain Solution (ONE SIMPLE DRILL!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwTutFFfsag	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what if you have pain when bench pressing then this is an absolute must-watch video for you and as somebody that actually deals with lots of pain when I bench press in my right shoulder du it a torn labrum I can vouch for the fact that this technique that I show you here will work and the good thing is it cuz what we something you can do right before the next time you bench press that to substantially increase the level of discomfort that you feel on the exercise help put your shoulder back in the position it should be in when you do the exercise and now allow you to start getting some benefits from it so what do we do you take a band and you wrap it around a pull-up bar above your bench press so even if you position your bar right near a doorway if you have to and hook it over your doorway pull-up bar and what you going to do is you three drills that I really two drills you with an underhand grip thumbs at out pinkies in to externally rotate the arms this way why do we externally rotate the arms CU we want to clear the space inside the shoulder joint all the issues that we deal with or predominantly most of the issues that we deal with as average guys is we either have impingement where we enough space inside that joint or we have things like I have my shoulder instability issues due to a torn laum what I can tell you is that even the bicep tendon can get inflamed in that scenario because it enough space inside that joint and it getting pinch because of all the instability but we have a lot of help we just never use it and the help is coming in the form of our shoulder stabilizers so back here to the exercise when I externally rotate my arms out I actually get activation of some of the muscles in our back that will actually help the stabilize the scapula but more than that now I go and I perform a reverse row or pull down whatever you want to call it here and what we retracting the scapula and getting the muscles in between the shoulder blades to actually engage pinch them back help even more to pull our shoulders into the right position so here that a lot of us will try to bench from the shoulders off of the bench rounded forward probably a result of a lot of our postural bad habits but it creating a nightmare scenario for anybody that either already has impingement or is on their way to impingement because you creating enough room for your shoulders to operate safely you can see that with this quick little fix by engaging the shoulder blades look at the position look how much better my my shoulders sit in their relative joints that I could actually push with some power and that the key too it positioning in the right way but it also providing a strong platform for you to push off of cuz if nothing is stable how are you ever going to push off of that surface you need to be rock hard so you can push back in the opposite way so we go back to this position with the shoulders now activated and after we do about 20 repetitions in a nice slow controll manner with our hands underhand now we go to an overhand grip and we try to simulate the grip width that we normally would have have on the bench press bar for me I like to go a little bit more narrow cuz I like to have a little bit more of that already pre adduction of the arms to have the chest activated a little bit more if I were to go a little bit wider I don get as much of a contraction on the chest but whatever you feel comfortable with and wherever you normally bench press That overhand grip pull Downs now and the same thing is applying here shoulder blades engaged have the shoulders pulled back and down and do your 20 repetitions here so after 40 reps now go grab those dumbbells and gopr or do the barbell whatever the hell was causing you pain before I will guarantee you that 90% of it is gone and it actually applying some physiology here and allowing those muscles that want to do the job so bad to stabilize your shoulders that you if you just activate them just a little bit with these two drills you to see that they they what they order to keep that there you want to incorporate a little bit of this into your regular routine now a lot of this guys is already built into our athletex training system I understand the pitfalls of where we fall apart and understand what things we need to do to keep our shoulders healthy it about getting big and strong and faster and quicker and all the things that athletes really want to become it about doing it safely and doing it for the long term if you program that puts the science back in strength then head to aex.com and get your training program in the meantime if you found this video helpful try this out I promise you if you are a shoulder pain sufferer with bench breast it going to help you I guarantee it all right I couple days	Success
Knee Pain With Exercise (SURPRISING CAUSE and HOW TO FIX IT!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbe_DqMJfzg	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com let you time likely you pain or might have knee pain in the future if you things guys knee pain can debilitate your leg workouts i know i from it and i know what it can do to your legs when you and especially squat heavy so what i want to do today is first of all cover a couple of reasons what might be causing your knee pain because that be important to understand the difference and then show you one that i think is really common especially for guys that train and lift weights so if we look here we and we what you we pain now you guys have probably heard about acl pain and mcl pain and lcl right we because those are ligaments that get injured during sports most most often those are the acl and pcl are inside the knee the lcl and mcl are going to be on the inside and outside of the knee and basically that we osteoarthritic changes that can happen where you actually get degenerative changes on the bone the bone and bone area or on the underside of the patella here that grinds up against the uh against the femur we can talk about that in a second we also have meniscus issues guys talk about that cushion between the two bones here the tibia and the femur that gives us that space between the joint that can wear down or tear but i find that the most common injury that we get when we train our inflammatory conditions from overuse of the patellar tendon so patellar tendon this is what you okay and what it does is it runs over the patella here holds it in place and you can get inflammation of this a lot of times causing patellar femoral issues we call it we heard that before and it impacts the tracking of the patella when your knee goes into flexion and extension so as we flex the knee and extend the knee you want normal mechanics of the patella so you get this glide and it glides right in this groove right here you can see that it right in this groove but what will happen is it starts to get out of position well guess what this isn a knee issue i talked about this before this is not a knee issue the knee is a train and this is its track here and here so guess what happens when the track gets twisted the knee in the train goes flying off the track so when you start looking and focusing all your efforts on the knee pain and trying to cure the patellar femoral issues or try to cure your patellar tendonitis and you paying any attention to the track you way off track so what you want to do is you want to start looking for the source and the cause of your knee pain because most often 99 of the time the source of that is going to be somewhere else and then when we look at this it bottom which can be controlled by your ankle and foot or the track at the top which is going to be caused by or controlled by the muscles in your head so if you look at what goes on here if you again one of my biggest issues if you have flat feet your foot will collapse down and in okay there arch comes down and in that takes the tibia here with it into internal rotation well this stays here this gets twisted in now you track so now this thing tries to move on this twisted track you can see it being pulled in you can see so it to move smoothly as we do this and with every rep of your squat with a flat foot that patella is banging up against the side of the track guess what happens inflammation you can get information on the underside patella you can get inflammation up through the tendon we have issues though okay so now up at the hip more common because you can fix this you can use an orthotic down here to try to boost up your arch so you can sort of fix the mechanics and reestablish your straight tracks but up here guys this is the big issue most guys have weak underdeveloped hips we talked about that a lot too if your hip is underdeveloped and it can rotation here of your femur the same thing is going to happen this could be all in line but if this gets pulled down and in you out too much because of tightness in through your hip you again i find the biggest issue here is glute medius weakness and that actually address too so i wanted to show you one of the ways that you can address that and even test yourself and see the easiest test and i know it sound embarrassing especially coming from a strength coach but lay on your side and do the jane fonda leg raise up up and down to the side do about 50 of them do 50 of them let me know in this video below if it burns like hell because i guarantee if you have weak glute medius you a real burn that might feel pretty damn intense and you might be squatting 350 400 pounds it might still feel like it really burns so if that happens to you you got to get that stronger so one of the ways that we do that is with a glute medius uh hip bump and it pretty simple what you is you drop right in pt we call this a tremdelenberg sign where just drop down to the side right because you letting go of the muscles over here that keep you upright so here in order to get it back we have to contract our glute medius which is going to pull our pelvis back and over to the side over here so what we closed chain hip abduction we know hip abduction if we at the right leg it leg out to the side like that if we were to try to do that in a closed chain with our foot connected to the ground this is what it would look like i away from my midline as i raise my midline to the right so just after doing this a little bit i can really feel a burn in that left side glute medius maybe it got to do is attach a band get inside of it and here put it around your hips do the same thing get up on your left leg if you hip you get up on the left leg and you face the hip that you towards the source of the band the point of attachment you let yourself drop just get really lazy let your hips drop from here you squeeze it straight over to the side let it drop squeeze your hips straight over the side this is not an ankle move this is not a knee move this is a hip move all your focus should be right here let it drop squeeze your hip lateral straight over to the side hold it for a second and then come down i can already again feel this burning and obviously working a weak area we had some top major league athletes that had extremely weak hips and you would be surprised because they were strong everywhere else this can cause knee pain this can cause chronic knee pain inflammation and everything else that it is you feeling so just because it it seems like kind of a girly exercise it doesn worthwhile and something you should do so guys again knee pain the take home messages here there kinds of knee pain as a trainer i see guys working out a lot of times they dealing with a lot of the chronic inflammatory conditions mostly of the tendons patellar tendon namely you can fix it but you gotta look other places you can gotta look up and down down your ankle up into your hip find out what the cause is if it persists and you are training with much more than knee pain it might be time guys you have to start looking into other solutions we athlete mechanics joint supplement for that very reason i realize how many guys train in pain every time i put up one of these videos there for shoulders elbows wrists neck people are dealing with pain we can fix that but you gotta look in the right places and if you have to guys you can take again find athlean rx mechanics over at athlete.rx.com meantime if you found this helpful leave a thumbs up below and a comment again i videos as you uh as you demand them so just let me know what it is you want to see all right guys i back here again soon	Success
Muscle Soreness Mystery - Should You WORK OUT or NOT?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NDAysp5n5M	ATHLEAN - X	is muscle soreness a good thing and perhaps the craziest challenge ever from athlean x g to cover it all in this [Music] video what aex.com got three things to cover in this video I mentioned two in the beginning but I want to talk about soreness muscle soreness because I get a lot of questions about whether or not it train with it or not so I want to cover that I also want to tell you about perhaps one of the craziest Challenges ever not done by me but someone that submitted it in and I you a little quick story about that and then tie it all together with these three bottles that are sitting in front of me okay but first let muscle soreness now the question is always on people with muscle soreness is it a good thing you know I I I don I should work out if I here differentiate what is the soreness okay are we talking about muscle soreness or we talking about joint and tendon soreness so a good way I feel a quick easy way to sort of tell you guys how to do that would be to locate where the where the soreness is if you can say like for biceps that you feel pain after training and generally again if it from your workout and doing good muscle damage it that 24 to 48 hour after the workout time period but if you can touch somewhere in the actual muscle and feel the discomfort more than likely it going to be because of your workout and that about the extreme ends of the muscle so down here or up here where the muscle either originates or attaches not really a great thing more likely you shifting it now towards a tendonous injury something that you should probably stay on top of or maybe the best treatment would be to get out of the gym in rest okay most often with overuse injuries that thing like down in your let training your Cals or you were running outside on on the sand on the beach and your Cals were sore the next day great that not used to the stimulus but if you starting to feel that lower down into the Achilles tendon again you that slight shift is going to be a good sign to you that maybe you overdid it um and did it damage to something other than your muscle so that would be the case now some people find that if it is in the muscles themselves like let from leg training workout it actually benefits to do something really light so if you have you know hit your legs hard with weights the next day really sore or two days later you actually benefit your legs to go take a fast walk just to get them working so you get some blood flow there because the blood flow will help to eliminate the lactic acid finally there is one other way you could do it you could if you had somebody around you had them move your limb through space so again if you right here you or whether it is inside the shoulder capsule or joint if you raise your arm up yourself okay and it hurts it could be either joint or muscle pain if someone else then comes and completely passively raises that arm for you and you still have pain or discomfort then you okay cuz we the equation so if you got somebody around to help you out let them do that and uh you might be able to differentiate whether or not you have something to work through or something that you should not work through all right now that we let definitely created sords here with this insane challenge I a little bit of an email that was sent to me and then sort of break down the most important part and how that sort of transitions into the RX supplements uh someone wrote into to me Jeff je I hope you are 18 years old we program since ax1 truly respect your knowledge creativity craft with Fitness um thanks for the compliments but we been talking we supplements like it can honestly say that they are without a doubt the best supplements on Earth we tried everything on the Shelf nothing compares to the Purity power inside of these three black bottles great and and that to do that guys but this is the email so the important part with that all in mind we got inspired by the challenges and athlete excise you guys know who follow our programs we have athl challenges built right into uh each and every week of the workouts uh we decided to push ourselves to an insane challenge it definitely falls into the realm of overtraining but keep in mind this is only done once and absolutely not weekly it was inspired by your 300 workout 143 reps of pull-ups assisted pull-ups guys 143 reps of 95lb deadlifts 143 push-ups 143 box jumps on a 24inch platform it goes on and on I whole letter down in the description here below but the point is he did that three times each time within an hour so you which is about 2 and 1 half hours longer than I recommend and 3,03 total reps which is God knows how many more reps than I recommend however he acknowledged that it was crazy gotten through that but he said I far you um you said it not me and the truth be told we are but we are smart with our supplementation he took his pre-workout before hand okay scoop one scoop beforehand he took three 3,000 reps later he took two scoops of the post-workout accelerate went home and took two scoops of the recovery shake and they crashed and they were out until later that evening asleep I they took two more scoops of the Reconstruction and they fell asleep until the next day the crazy parties he said besides the challenge was they were not sore not sore like at all my only guess is it had to be the supplements it long but it would have been one or the other with without your supplements motivation inspiration a little Insanity so here up guys is there is a connection between muscle soreness and Recovery obviously the faster you recover the quicker you can get rid of muscle soreness supplementation I believe that the strongest places that supplements play a role now for those guys who know anything about anabolic steroids first of all you should know they incredibly dangerous you should stay away from them with your life the fact of the matter is mechanically the way they work is by speeding up recovery almost making Muscle Recovery a nonissue okay these guys that abuse anabolic steroids are basically training and training and training and training but because their recovery is almost instantaneous they can accumulate these high volumes and that results for us guys that avoid that stuff and look for natural ways to get bigger get stronger get faster we have to look at ways we can improve our recovery so muscle soreness is an important issue it be uh ignored with the RX supplement uh series the biggest my biggest priority when I created these was to what can we do to address muscle soreness we know that we have to elicit muscle soreness to have some sort of a stimulus to get bigger and stronger so with a pre-workout you want to be able to have the necessary intensity to go at your workout and give it a good effort because that stimulus to create some of the micro damage in your muscles that will promote recovery that have to be recovered right in order to get back bigger and stronger so you take care of that in the post-workout you want to have a supplement that will initiate that repair process quickly right because you have a completely different environment inside the muscle cells after a workout than you did before your post-workout is critical to try to initiate that repair process and I think the biggest most overlooked aspect of supplementation and Recovery is what you do before you go to bed we think you should do your stretching before you go to bed I also think that supplementation highgrade protein have the the the nutrients in place to be able to help the repair process especially when the repair process kicks in the most which is when you are sleeping it of the process guys the right supplements can easily improve your rate of recovery and if you can improve your rate of recovery the rate that you can get rid of muscle soreness the faster you can come back and train hard again so a long video here I hope you stayed until the very end but the key point is muscle soreness is it a bad good thing bad thing I think it making improvements but how you deal with that muscle soreness and how you approach it from a a holistic standpoint it RX for me is what I use and apparently here with these guys these crazy gu I Gotta Give Them credit Nathan Nathan swi uh congratulations you came up with the craziest freaking work I in my life but you survive and thank God all right guys that here um with a new more videos leave your questions because it like this that spark these sort of videos and ideas so if you have a question yourself let me know and we uh maybe I in the meantime if you haven a RX supplements guys you want to try it you know experience the sort of effect that these guys have and you can get these at athleen rx.com all right guys I just a couple [Music] days [Music] he	Success
Shoulder Pain and Popping (SHORT & LONG TERM FIX!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsmeXwHu6W0	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com if you are one of the many that gets popping clicking crunching snapping whatever the feeling that you describe as you raise your arm up over your head you this video first of all you got to figure out what the hell is going on and that therapist is to try to help you do but secondly I got to try to give you something that can help you actually immediately and will also give you optimum for a long term cure okay so what we have to do first of all is understand what it is and we know that when you raise your arm up over your head a couple things need to happen one will cover in another video and that is you do need to have your shoulder blade help you so you can by raising your arm up on its own you need motion upward rotation here of the shoulder blade to allow you to complete that motion all the way up over your head okay that another time but the second thing is you need help from these really overlooked no one cares about muscles here and the back of our shoulder is called the rotator cuff and these in particular they themselves around here supraspinatus infraspinatus teres minor they they position themselves and they wrap around they grab on this way around here onto your arm so you can see that if they were to contract they this they right so going to grab it here and pull it this way they rotate it back like that the upper arm is going to rotate back here into the socket what that does is it plays a critical role when you raise your arm up overhead for any sort of overhead press or pressing movement tricep work because it the head of the humerus centered into the ball and socket if the head of humerus starts to migrate up as you go and raise your arm up it starts to bang into the roof here of this joint and pinches the structures that are in here pinches the tendons can actually really start to eventually tear your supraspinatus tendon that talk about a rotator cuff tear because it it down so much that it finally just gives out so what you want to do is you don want that upward migration you want be able to keep it centered and what these do is they actually keep it centered in the joint and actually externally rotate it to allow for more space in the joint as you raise your arm up over your head so how do we work this and how do we figure out that going on for you again it common problem lots of other things can be causing shoulder problems but this is one of the most common because we as lifters tend to never really pay attention to these and these are the only muscles that will help you to counteract this so you have to work them there do is you head to the wall like I going to show you here you position yourself where your arms are in your elbows are against the back of the wall okay so you back up and the two key points you want to focus on are right here you want to focus on this point of your finger okay and keeping that against the wall and you want to focus on your elbow but really the back side and being able to keep that against the wall when you get to the very top you see that once you get to the level of your shoulders then as you raise up the elbows will come off the wall but try to almost bring them together to further externally rotate the arm and almost bring your hands those two points I talked about together you might notice that the first time up you get ever so far but then the elbows will come off or the fingers will come off you can the next time you try meaning the next rep you see a little bit better improvement and then the next rep you still have a better improvement do that for about five or six reps then take a step away from the wall and then try to raise your arms up over your head if you were someone that was already experiencing cracking popping snapping grinding crunching whatever the hell you want to describe it as you may not feel all that much anymore in fact you might feel none and the optimism behind that is that you repositioned or activated the rotator cuff to allow you to reposition that head of the humerus where it should be and therefore clear more room and give you a better chance of raising your arm over your head without any kind of pinching so we know that if you actually train them long term and incorporate some of that into your training at the right times you could fix this and you could overcome that long before it led to a frame to the point of a tear in your shoulder and that is going to be key you can worn down with your training because ultimately once you do have a shoulder problem it very tough to recover from especially when you figure you consider all the strength movements that require shoulder activation and involvement right so you want to make sure that prevention here is the key if you program that will help you to prevent that while at the same time obviously helping you get bigger get stronger look better right we know that that goal behind a lot of people the gym but to do it in a safe way then head to athleanx.com guys and get our athleanx training system as a physical therapist it was my priority to make sure I didn bigger and stronger and faster but also keep yourself safe in the long run if you found this video helpful make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below and let me know whatever else you want to see again I the skeleton Raven here to break down whatever it is that you want me to explain even further all right guys we you	Success
Perfect Posture in 5 Steps (BAD POSTURE BUSTER!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQqgf8kB6R8	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what today I simple steps how you can start fixing your posture once and for all you see it the past but I probably been trying the wrong things because a lot of people mean well but they are not telling you the right cues and the right things to focus on and it strange walking around or more frustrated because you can anything long term here to do you got to start focusing on the things that you can change and the first thing you need to do is stand on up get yourself in the mirror and turn sideways because you want to look at the angle of your neck first now a lot of us will tell us you got to tuck your chin in you got to do that that going to you like this and it what you the angle of your neck and I about this portion from here to here what is it doing is it tilted forward if it not talking about the angle that you want the angle that you want is going to be almost vertical here and perpendicular to the ceiling and what happens is when the angle of your neck is good there it actually puts your chin and the rest of your head in a nice carry position instead of having to wor worry about pulling your chin back and in and what happens is we do get sort of misguided and think that we right position because even when we forward our body is smart enough to make sure that our eyes are pointed forward so we lift up but if you looked in the mirror you what but then we can move down to the next segment here and it girdle and again what you shoulder blades together or roll your shoulders back well the problem is you way CU you you can do alternatively in a much easier and more effective way is Focus right here on the sternum this m this bone here in your chest isn but it position and your rib cage is obviously controlling your shoulder blade position because they are attached to it so what you want to do is focus on the position of the top portion right here of your sternum is it angled down at all I can guarantee if you have forward shoulders it see here you can fix that by lifting your sternum and trying to get the top of it think of it as a glass of water is it pouring out forward at all or can you get it perfectly straight you can do that by lifting your sternum up but look what happens when we do that that easy to control but when we do that the shoulders go what back and down they in the perfect position just by fixing the position of our sternum so now you keep it going as we work our way down through the kinetic chain we have to always pass through the core and that a good thing cuz your core is something that you need to help you to stabilize the position in the in the the the proper position that you established up above remember this is one continuous spine from your neck to in between your shoulder blades into through your thoracic spine now down into your lumbar spine well we can control that and stabilizing that by having some contraction of the core now I to pull down and create actual spinal flexion that wouldn talking about creating an engagement here of your core and getting better at being able to do that throughout the entire day you can do that and talk and you can do that and do whatever else you your abs the resting tone of your abs and again you so now here you are your chest is up your neck stabilize by getting a little bit of a contraction of your core not flexing but Contracting work your way down the chain now now we the problem again most of us sit all day long we work we drive whatever it is we have this anterior tilt to the pelvis that happens because the hip flexors get tight from all the sitting that we do as they pull down they get us into this anterior tilt as you see here but we can fix that very very easily by just Contracting our glutes squeeze your butt cheeks together as hard as you can guess what you just put yourself into a more of a posterior tilt you might be in a actually perfectly neutral position but you to a more posterior position by Contracting your glutes keep that going with the contraction of your abs you got a nice co contraction here you just stabilize the pelvis and put it in the right spot by having both of those areas contra contracted together now finally check out the position of your knees I can pretty much guarantee you some flexion going on in your knees you got a little bit of a Bend going on in your knees and you didn it here all together straighten your knees contract your quads you can see now that the entire posture from the top down has been fixed in just five easy to manipulate areas you can easily change the degree of flexion in your knees you can easily change the the the contraction going on in your glutes by just actively squeezing them together you can easily engage your abs more than they are right now you can easily tilt your sternum up if it pointing down and you can easily change the position of your neck without having to worry about all these crazy weird things it I there because if you can what can keep it there by using this one drill that I gave sort of like this Cam Newton Superman drill believe it or not but what you do is you take a band you wrap it around you don not going to suffocate yourself or constrict yourself too much you do is you wrap it around from the front to the back you bring the bands in front of you you grab the left one with the right hand the right one with the left hand and you get your hands in position right here in front of your chest now here remember Cam Newton pull out open the Superman chest this way Reveal Your s well we you going to pull out and r rotate so here now what I find that because the band is across my low back it upright posture from here my shoulder blades are going down and back because the sternum is coming up here I external rotation on the uh shoulders because my bands are coming out and back the thumbs are pointing towards the back and of course I focus on keeping the core contracted underneath the bands I the glutes going to make sure that pelvis is in the right position and I have my knees nice and straight and all I do is hold this here for as long as I can if I can hold it for one or two minutes great if I find that I fatiguing and losing the right changes I that I Incorporated in here that I might want to relax and then do it again but the idea is once you it out come back here and stand and you to maintain that position because most most of the time these areas that we trying to change here they dormant they up and if you do this a couple times a day and I mean literally a couple times if you could do it for a minute or two good do it once or twice a day you will see incredibly fast changes because like I said you are talking about tapping into areas that you never knew how to control before and by just doing it in a in a different way you to control the muscles and you can make some really quick changes here and be able to maintain a much better posture without having to think about it try these it want you to tell me how it works for you in the meantime if you program guys that doesn oh this is how it works but shows you how to do it step by step so that you understand number one cuz when you understand you uh better things much more quickly I do that for you I try to break it down for you step by step it program you can get it over at aex.com I hope this one helped you out make sure let me know below leave your comments and a thumbs up and uh let me know what else you want me to cover here on this channel and I in the days and weeks ahead I back here soon	Success
The Truth About Tennis Elbow (WHAT REALLY CAUSES IT!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTjDq3_D-FU	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what athleanx.com today we all about tennis elbow and really what the hell because a lot of you out there who deal with this common very common orthopedic issue aren but you time getting rid of it well we have to as we always say here start looking somewhere other than where it hurts if you really want to get to the root cause of what orthopedic issue you whatever issue is preventing you from getting your best workouts in or competing you have to start looking at the place that start looking above and below where it hurting so let me explain a little bit when we know that it the outside of the forearm that killing us but does it mean that that the cause no we know already we know that 99 percent of the time when something one of the supporting areas or joints that all the brunt especially with a joining question here is one of those more stable and immobile joints and that exactly what you the elbow all it likes to do is hinge up and down that should remind you of something else the knee the knee we talked about before in other videos how the knee deals with all of the in abilities of the hip and the ankle to do their own job when the ankle breaks down when the mobility of the ankle is either too much or too little it sends stress up through the knee when the hip is either too tight or too weak it sends stress down towards the knee the same thing happens here in the elbow so before you start thinking oh I got to sit here and rub the outside of my elbow because my therapist told me to do that or I got a really strengthen the outside of my forearms by doing a lot of wrist extensions right you know first extension with dumbbells because I have weak form extensors that causes you to have even more pain I can tell you this is not going to fix your problem so we got to start thinking a little bit differently if you look at your forearm a lot of times guys the weakness is on this side the forearm that everyone tells you it is it on this side of the forearm completely counter to what you here forearm flexors are a weak and let back to tennis because it an easy way for us to describe its function if you you have to serve right you know that a lot of wrist flexion powerful wrist flexion will come in as the racket comes down to execute that serve guess what happens if you don to execute that flexion you have to keep you have to create it you create that by pre-loading the wrist flexors by putting them on stretch very much the same way that if we want to jump high we don start from here we have to preload the quads and glutes by leaning you bike by squatting down to jump well the same thing will happen here but every single time you have to execute that powerful wrist flexion you preload back here and you get an overuse of that muscle it asked to do a job that it wasn to do and that for the muscles on the other side so the first thing you start evaluating where are you getting the pain what is the the activity that causing it and maybe see if it could be something related to your form see in this video there that tells you that there not telling you the truth there fix but I got at least get your mind thinking where it might be and certainly get it off of the area that everyone else is telling you that it I know long-term you much better shot at fixing this that said the next place you to look up here in the shoulder when we look at the shoulder here how could the shoulder have anything at all to do with what because they guys this is one bum that comes down and feeds into the elbow so whatever is mechanically happening up here just like whatever is happening at the hip it going to have a carryover effect into what the joint is below that so guys with bad posture we all know there whole bunch of them running around the gyms all the time the internal shoulder rotation shoulder rotation here and a rounded shoulder posture what does that do it creates an internal rotation of the arm the internal rotation of the arm creates a pronation here of our forearm right it all kind of comes together that have this prolonged internal rotation flexor pronator tightness you to get a prolonged stretch on the outside of the extensors on the opposite side remember what happens when we have prolonged stretch we get weakness so we could have weakness see we it always in black or white we could have weakness but guess what I wasn just didn extensor dumbbell exercises because you can do all these if you want if you don to really help to counteract what going on at this forearm and that think the issue here you one thing that problem and again it if you can reposition this shoulder in the right place maybe you the adequate strength in that forearm to not have caused that in the first place because once you restore the normal length tension in there you alright so lastly athletes throwing athletes again the tennis server the the football player the baseball player anybody that has to throw or you know try to decelerate if you don proper strength and mechanics here back to your shoulder playing scapula to each centrically decelerate your arm and guess what do the job that that once again you of your forearm because you can see that if my muscles are supposed to be decelerating my arm here so that doesn fly off of my body into the camera right at you if it to try and dam this every single step of the way all the way through this kinetic chain until the very last chance I have which is right through my hand as I let go of the ball if I don I through the forearm and where you get a really overactive use here he centrically forearm extensors to try to accomplish that so here I not getting help my arms coming in too quickly I really have to hold up my wrists here in this extended position I put a lot of stress up on this bundle up here and again yeah I as a wrist extensor to help but it doing any good in a long term because all it lot of pain so I hope guys that you can see that to fix this problem to fix one of the most common orthopedic problems around it doesn doing doesn have to start looking at least below down on your wrist into your forearm or up into your shoulder and most of all stop doing this stop wearing your your your braces that you put over here to buy it Walgreens and stop thinking that just doing these exercises going to fix your problem you got to make sure you doing the right things to attack this problem a long term all right guys if you like these kind of videos remember we break out Raymond every now and then so we can do some more of these pts videos but I want you to know I want to know about it let me know leave your comments below one of the issues that you cover them in the video but at the end of the day it the gym and functioning as best that you possibly can and when I write my programs as a physical therapist I do exactly that it aesthetically it stronger yes we want you to perform better but if you can going to mean a damn at all so I got to make sure that when we write our program for writing them using science and putting it back in strength and that what we do if you haven head to athleanx.com right now get our 90-day training program and see what it stay healthy and perform at your best cuz a lot of times we never ever get a chance to experience that we banged up alright guys be back here again in just a couple days let me know if this one helped you out you	Success
Low Back Pain and Working Out (IMPORTANT!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzqWHuAkAM	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what maybe you had a back injury in the past and you think that your days of lifting are over or at least your days of lifting heavy weights are over but I you today that that especially if you start training your body and your back the right way you see the back is is extremely important for us for a lot of reasons if you looking at the upper back here right we have one of the most important structures in your entire body to protect and that is the spinal cord and it will do anything in its power to be able to do that so we often times will get lots of muscle spasm in in here through the upper back because you trying to do one thing you create stability and if you don the stability through the strength of your Min scapular muscles or anything upper back guess how you it you and the spasm is going to you know create an artificial stability but that we get to the low back we also have obviously some really critical functions here to protect our whole center of gravity and what happens is the low back usually takes on the brunt of insufficient Mobility other places usually in the joints right below that most most importantly the hips if your hips are not mobile enough or strong enough basically it it shifts the brunt of its work and responsibility one link up the kinetic chain right here to the lumbar spine not good if you don a back able to withstand that so now you in yourself what helping you get back on track I to tell you this right now you got to make sure you remember this it you have to go for stamina before strength in the lower back if you want to recuperate from an injury and get back to lifting more than you ever did before you have to focus on stamina before strength maintaining obtaining and then maintaining the stable lumbar spine posture is critical to every single thing you you step over a deadlift whether you do a bent over row whether you doing a laying down bench press the stability through your core is going to start with a stable lumbar spine and getting into the natural curvature of your spine and being able to hold it so the best thing you can do before you even worry about strength is start doing exercises like I is not really a hyperextension people will call this a hyper extension but we up into extension what we is we position with a little bit of extension the natural curvature of your lumbar spine and you want to make sure that you can hold this and when I say hold this I like a plank start going for durations of a minute a minute and a half 2 minutes when you can handle that guess what you do next you weight it and you don doing here equally with a weighted vest but you can actually do it when I doing here and that loading because you never get the luxury especially if you don symmetrically across your spine so hold the dumbbell a little bit out to your side or a kettle bell a little bit out to one side and still try to maintain that nonrotated stable position of your lumbar spine now once you place the idea here is build up your volume so again stamina so it stamina in a single session but it stamina over the course of multiple sessions so work on getting yourself to be able to tolerate this not just one time a week but two times three times four times a week build up your volume do it in multiple sessions across the week and you stamina will be right where you need it to be to move on to phase two and that is the strengthening and guess what when you get back to doing your strengthening you have to make sure you take a baby steps progression because it take a lot to overcome the the hesitation that your body will have to allow you to exert the strength that you possibly have right you may have a lot of strength but if you can your back that you going to give it to you so you have to make sure that even if you used to be able to deadlift 315 lbs 400 lb before you hurt your back you got to start way back at the beginning again 135 lbs do it through multiple sets multiple reps and convince yourself that you are in complete Command of each each and every one of those reps when you baby step up to the next Notch and I not talking jumping up to 185 but I talking about going to 155 and convincing yourself that you can do that and over time as you really start to command every single rep of that deadlift your back will actually allow you to start using the strength that you have and that you had maybe that you never really lost as long as you doing the right progression now the last note here weightlifting belts guys will ask Jeff is it proper to use a weightlifting belt I say no not if you your strength we all know that a weightlifting belt can give us the temporary feeling of uh of safety that we have to maybe attack a workout but in the long run that can do because attacking a workout with false sense of security is the fastest way to get hurt again okay so what you want to do is avoid the weightlifting belt we know that when we have a lower leg injury and we wrap a knee brace around our our knee our quads will tend to shut down they brace to do the work we don we don structures to say Hey you do the work I one you want to make sure that your internal stabilizers from the front to the back the transer to Dominus all the muscles in through your lower back they guess what they should be doing the work after all guys I hope you found this video helpful and I there Fusion a few years ago at multiple levels and she now back not only deadlifting but deadlifting more than she ever has before she she ever has been before because she training the right way she she worried in the beginning about getting stamina she then built her strength and now she to all new levels and that guys can do too if you guys are looking for a program that puts the science back in strength it therapist so we know that there progression to everything we do and there I head to aex.com right now and get our athletex training system in the meantime if you found this video helpful or if you make sure you let me know below and I keep making more of these videos you know we break out our boy here Ray to show you guys exactly what inside the body to help us understand more of what our bodies are capable of I just a couple days	Success
5 Ways Flat Feet ÂFÂ Up Your Workouts!! (EXERCISES TO FIX THEM!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2BFeod_JMk	ATHLEAN - X	what you out then this is one video that you can five ways that flat feed are flat out you up in your workouts and I going to explain each one of them to you today I on his own body why that is and most importantly I ways that you can try to start fixing it yourself all right so we got a big video here an important video Raymond got dressed up for it that just shows you how important this really is especially if you flat feet as I said there are five ways that it is really really affecting your workouts and I showing you down the ground exactly what you can start to understand why it bad and what its implications are for your workouts all right so let at these feet and see what I about when I say flat feet again you know if you have them what but for those that don important you spacing here on the inside of your foot you okay some room in here to actually get I don the ground that you could still stand over and not squish it to the ground here you can see that that would be impossible there here for my hand that is a that is an absence of an arch now there things that can cause this guys there can be congenital inherited things there could be La just general laxity um there could be uh dysfunctions of the muscle themselves there real definitive cause but when you have them you got to do something about treating them so I the exact uh ways that this is going to cause a problem and then show you how uh to most importantly try to try to combat this and fix this yourself okay first up and a real big one here especially if you guys are squatting at all you real hard time maintaining proper squat mechanics if you uncorrected flat feet the reason being is all you have to do is look at what happens on the ground I talk about it all the time guys it and everything starts from the ground up you can see that on this side here that when the foot has an arch it allows the the ankle knee and hip to stay in alignment because that Arch elevates the foot just enough to keep that tibia right here in line with the knee right here in line with the hip okay so everything can kind of move in line the way it bit exaggerated here but you can see down at the ground when the arch is collapsed what happens is the heel kicks out to the side here and it brings the tibia and it rotates it inward as soon as you do this you a torque right here at the knee cuz this inward rotation here of the tibia causes this torquing so you to have some knee pain we that again in a little while but it all also completely misaligns this track okay the track is now off track as we say and I said before the patella runs on the track it should run nice and straight up here like this here it obviously is not you some knee issues you have implications up here at the hip you keep your knees out the way you should during a squat because it instantly rotated and caving in this way you could get some ligament stress on the inside of the knee and then up here at your back obviously if you hip issues you compensations at your back and that can cause a whole host of issues too so we want to make sure that if we be squatting we got to do something about these flat feet okay number two you knee stress and even hip stress really for that matter and back stress with jumping if you don Arch why because this Arch down here allows for an Ecentric loading of the foot to allow you to actually absorb the landing think about even in your quads when you do a jump and you jump and you land if you jump and you land with straight legs you have no absorption of that Landing but if you allow your knees to bend into a squat you let the quads take on the Ecentric loading so you can soften the landing the same thing happens down here at the foot if you have a nice Arch here when you land you absorb it through this excursion from up top down to a flat foot if you look at it over here this person that and Landing they they there is no Ecentric slowing down or loading of that foot to take away some of the stretch that get that uh thrown up into the knee and then up into the hip and obviously into the low back so think about it box jumps um jumping jacks uh jump rope all the things that you could be doing anything that you jumping even explosive lifts like uh hand cleans if you absorbing down here at the foot then you it sending all that shock up into the knee up into the hip and into the back okay so now listen up all you running athletes if you have flat feet you developing adequate running power and speed the reason being is there main functions of the feet the first one we talked about already it has to be able to adapt to the surface that you step on so when you put your foot down because the arch is there it allows you to eccentrically adapt to that surface what happens is the midfoot joints here loosen up allow you to sort of adapt to whatever the shape and surface is that you function of the foot is it must be able to become a rigid lever it has to be a rigid lever one that you can Propel your body off of as you run so as the foot goes back into swing phase and you going to now push off to allow your yourself to then take your next step you have to have an ability to lock up this mid joint so you go into planer flexion you push off your calf right you get into planer flexion all these joints in here lock up and now become a real rigid lever literally they functionally become rigid mechanically so you can push off of that well someone that has a flat foot they much better job of adapting to the surface but they do a really poor job of pushing off behind uh for any power or strength so if you luck trying to generate as much power as somebody that doesn you every tenth of a second matters you likely going to have a hard time keeping up okay the next issue that we run into is a big issue I times on our channel here glute Amnesia and how that impacts a lot of the things that we do basically any lower body exercise because you want in in in perfect world The glutes to be working with the hamstrings all right if they go to sleep if they have amnesia and they should you put a lot more stress on the hamstring than it should have because it really wants to work in concert with the glutes together so how do we do that what back again to the original thing as I said when the foot collapses then the tibia collapses as well when that happens the knee kicks in you get torque on the knee the hip becomes internally rotated so now when the hip is internally rotated here what happens the muscles that externally rotate the hips especially the glute medius kind of go on constant stretch and a long stretch they become weak so you get long stretched out glute medius they get weak as soon as those become weak as I said now you muscle that whose real main function is to assist in all of your lower body strengthening uh and and power and function once that goes to sleep you putting a hell of a lot of stress on muscles that aren or or strong enough to really take on that roll of two and they wind up getting hurt so you can get hamstring injuries you can get uh again back issues because again the muscles above and below the non-functioning muscle usually going to wind up uh having an issue so glut Amnesia a bad thing but it here at the foot because of what on uh with that Arch finally we the other issues that you see again I already talked about a whole bunch but patella tendonitis and planer fastis twoo big things that wind up usually following in sequence with somebody that because you can see that if this foot collapses like this one over here is if it collapses down to the ground you got constant tension stress on the planer fascia underneath your foot if that constant pulling it inflammatory Condition it just a chronic degeneration of that Tenon because of the pulling on both sides of his attachments so that major issue the second is patella 10us and we talked about this in our knee video it discussion that we the train which is the patella to ride up and down on that track correctly then you better make sure you keep that track straight if you bending and warping the track this way that something up down at the ground here then that patella is not going to have a real easy time following up and down smoothly on here you patella issues tracking issues which are going to lead to a lot of pain in your patella tendon which could feel like little knives going in every single time you squat certainly something that you don five big ways that these are uh screwing with your workouts but I want to try to show you a couple things that you might be able to do to strengthen those muscles down here at the foot to get them a little bit more well equipped to handle the stresses from above all right so here attack if you want to start trying to strengthen the muscles in here again people might run get and get Orthotics and that as a crutch but it to actually fix the problem it filling in the Gap here that you don have in terms of your arch so if we want to really want to try to get at this you want to look at the muscles that might potentially be weak that are causing what to be able to do is start strengthening the muscles actually in your big toe believe it or not this big toe here can have a lot of force and power and assist you in lifting up your arch by being able to to flex against the force of gravity against your own weight so I going to show you an exercise that will Target that and allow you to start doing that secondly we want to start working on a muscle called the posterior tibialis right so what I did was I attached this rubber band here to sort of see its function it basically originates here on your tibia it comes down and attaches right here in our in our um our midfoot so you can see that this is literally when this contracts is holding up the Arch if I were take this off you see the arch collapses so what happens is a lot of times people have a weakness in this muscle they don enough strength in this muscle to actually hold up and support the arch so if there strengthen this posterior tibialis that would be awesome because we can get this to then hook on again and allow it not hook on it know the function of of being able to lift this Arch by making it a lot more uh strong and be able to pull that up all right so first we want to cover that exercise that will help us to get those intrinsic muscles underneath our toes to try to get a Little Bit Stronger so all I have here and all you quarter and you want to take again my Spar my ugly feet here but you getting my ugly flat feet they flippers you want to take the big bone right here at the base of your toe and step on the quarter right at that spot okay so right there now all you trying to do here is push as hard as you can into the ground with the front of your toes here especially your big toe and you want to try to do that and what you the arch again I flat feet they basically lay down there at at usual but if I can actually press you can see I can create a little bit of an arch you just want to make sure that you stay in contact with that quarter the entire time cuz what you want to do is start rolling off and if you start rolling off and either it lifts up with you or you lift off the quarter that you want to just get here in this position again the quarters under that toe you push the toes into the ground and you heel stays on the ground and you trying to keep that um Arch as engaged as you possibly can you use it as an isometric you try to hold on to that for about 20 30 seconds if you can rest and do it about four or five times you try to do that at least three or four times a week to try to build up a tolerance and a strength uh in that area so on the second exercise here we want to go after that posterior tibialis like I told you uh just a second ago again the function of that muscle when it strong is going to support that Arch it you that Arch that maybe you lack right now so the way we want to do that is you want to work in this sort of single leg standing um band rotation uh drill where you anchored somewhere on the outside of the foot that you I I the outside of my right side and I going to just try to pull the band across my body really all you to do is just disturb your balance so it doesn doesn direction and you especially if you have flat feet that inner side of your foot is going to light up that posterior tip is going to really light up to try to prevent you from falling off to the side you that if I were to let the band just pull me at will it would basically pull me all the way out to my side here I invert my foot and I basically fall off to the right side to combat that I got to use this muscle to try to really work to hold me down in position and again over time that your arch yeah it you here for the purpose of this exercise but that it support that you need and act as a sling to hold that arch up so long term this is exactly what you want to try to do combine this with the intrinsic uh exercise I showed you before you could be well on your way to actually combating this without needing any kind of orthotic so there you have it guys athlet next putting the science back in strength again a little bit in depth here especially for those guys who are experiencing flat feet you got to know about how it and more importantly hopefully have some weapons in Your Arsenal to try to combat that everything matters guys especially when you the function of strength realizing that everything starts from the ground and it works its way up because our whole body is one kinetic chain if you don working on the ground and fixing the stuff that have a whole lot of stuff that goes wrong up through the rest of your body and that guys we some of the Advanced Training principles to your training to help you get more out of it doesn it can be a whole lot of other things that you important thing is if you them with science behind you you going to start seeing faster and better results and that athl next training program if you haven now use the exact same training program that I use with top pro athletes to get yourself in the best shape of your entire life and stronger faster and functioning better than ever before all right guys leave a comment below if you have flat feet let me know and uh if you found this video helpful let me know and whatever else you like to see just let me know that too because I video on it I promise	Success
7 Core Exercises for Low Back Pain (IMPORTANT!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIhCuqtC0r0	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com so we about mobility lately and this being a washboard Wednesday we about it again but we problems a lot of people will get a lot of times when doing ab exercises and that is they sore in their hip flexors or they low back pain in the common root cause of both of those things is actually possibly your abs you see a lot of times people will look at where the symptom is in treat the symptom ie they your hip flexors out and say god I getting any better or a little stretched your low back out and say god I getting any better but if you want to train like an athlete if you want to look below the surface as a physical therapist that to do in order to earn a living we got to look a little bit deeper we have to find what the root causes and the ABS can absolutely be the cause of both of those issues and a matter of fact they could be playing a large part in creating a vicious cycle to make that problem even worse so how does this all happen well the first thing that we have to understand is that our body really wants to create stability through our spine our spine is the most important structure in our entire body we know that injury to the spine can be debilitating so if our body is out to protect the spine at all costs it stability in the help of other muscles to do that so our abs in our core are one of the biggest areas we have to be able to be able to provide the stability that we need against potential harm to our spine but guess what a lot of us don don other muscle groups and that happens most often in the hip flexors the hip flexors because of their attachment to the lumbar spine they run all the way up through our body and attach to the lower five vertebra of our spine that will provide us with some stability from the bottom up and again through the low back right to our LMR spine so we will get stability of our spine but not with the muscles that we first place so what again stretching the hip flexors no because those hip flexors need to be strong and on a call all day long because your abs aren job so then people finally might get to the bottom of it in their toe to go train their abs what there you start doing ab exercises that contribute more to the problem because 90% of ab exercises especially if done improperly are gonna overwork the hip flexors so I wanted to put together for you here some options that you might have especially if you low back pain or even get those hip flexors on fire all day long here ab exercises that you that will take the hip flexors right out of it and allow you to actually strengthen your abs without further making this problem worse alright take a look at these exercises alright first up is the John to sit up now this is one that we and some of our other videos and this is really a classic example of how we can try to turn the hip flexors off we know that there inhibition that if you contract a muscle on one side of a joint we can actually try to turn off the muscle that opposite side of the joint there easiest example a way to show this is through our bicep if we contract our bicep our tricep has to can relax in order to allow the movement at the joint in this direction same thing here if we contract with our tricep we bicep relaxed to allow the movement in the opposite direction well we know that the hip extensors and the glutes and hamstrings are gonna work together opposite what the hip flexors are trying to do so if we can position yourself like I around a post and contract my hamstrings and glutes right a little bit now we got active contraction on the muscles on the opposite side of the hip flexors that should turn the hip flexors off now we can start doing our crunches so we can actually target the ABS without allowing the hip flexors to dominate next up another one we a lot here lately we call it gymnast abs and you can see you setup here or a captain and all you want to do is support the weight of your body by getting your arms outstretched and locked out it your elbows here we don working the triceps so get your arms locked out use the stability of your shoulders and now all you is just simply lift the pelvis back into a posterior tilt you with your hip flexors you can see it better when you come around the side here I all all I pelvis into a posterior tilt and lift the tailbone up towards the ceiling it very very easy to do and of course it going to work our ABS tremendously without having to incorporate our hip flexor we can use with a band all you got to do is anchor to something sturdy and do the first exercise I which is a pal off press so now we stabilizing on one leg yes we this other leg isometrically holding the hip Flexer up but we real dynamic work there we holding it in position and the real work is being done by the core to try to keep your body upright and stable as I press the band up overhead again not actively involving the hip flexors in the movement just for the positioning here of the exercise we can move and become a little bit more dynamic by doing the sledgehammer swings now we actively twist and turn our torso in the opposite direction of the band obviously step out further you get more resistance we here we in control of rotation but our feet are planted firmly on the ground there active contribution here of the hip flexors at least dynamically again stabilizing from below but not dynamically working as they do in some other exercises finally we move on here to the jump out variation of this which is just a little bit more dynamic and explosive and the same thing applies you front of your body you anti rotation ability of your core you landing without allowing the band to pull you back yes you to go back it back because it your abs but again you hip flexors out of it and next we have an exercise a lot of people don associate necessarily with the core exercise but it absolutely is yeah it going to work your forearm and grip strength too which is a bonus but the thing here that we focus on is controlling the stability of your core remember it stabilizing your spine there better here than a suitcase carry here I and I shoulders as I possibly can do so I trying to walk here towards the camera and then get away from you the goal here is to try to keep my shoulders level I got a hundred pounds weighing me down on one side it becomes a bit of a challenge but the only thing we help us will be our spinal erectors in our core in front our ABS in front and trying to pull us upright and maintain that upright position obviously the heavier weight you use here the more of a challenge and finally we have a side plank leg lift once again we flexors here in the sagittal plane we working a frontal plane motion here that allows us to get our stabilizers working tremendously hitting them from a different angle and now we get into a side plank that could be enough for most of you but if you want to really add a challenge try to lift your leg up here as you that will actually make it much harder for me because now I ability to push through into the floor with two feet and two legs but really just with that bottom leg which makes it all that much more demanding for that lateral pillar strength on that bottom side so there you have it guys there are some ways for you to start training your abs especially if you suffering from some of this low back pain when you or you through your low back every time you try to do more traditional ab exercises and again I think it underscores a very important point when it comes to mobility don people say oh my hip flexor is tight stretch it no that to do you got to look a little bit deeper maybe you have to start looking at muscles that are weak and that those other muscles are kicking in and doing their job for them so there one common answer for every single thing when it comes to mobility you got to be a little bit more specific about that hopefully through these videos you starting to see that if you guys want to start training with a system that uncovers and peels back some of the layers we don stuff to give you everything else that everybody else is already giving you we try to help you train a little bit more scientifically but at the same time a lot more productively that athlean-x is

4 Causes of UNEVEN MUSCLES (and how YOU can FIX them!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKSX5WhkPh0	ATHLEAN - X	are your muscle and strength and balance is messing with more than just your workouts at this point maybe messing with your head I today the four root causes and most importantly what you can do to try to reverse them what cavaliere athleanx.com look whether it the way the muscle looks or how it functions and what its strength is muscle imbalances can definitely do a number on our workouts and sometimes too on our psyche right we figure out what is it that to be so weak differently between my right side of my left side for instance um if I why can I curl more on the right side versus the left side or vice-versa why does it feel different on the right side versus the left side well I kind of make it contract the way that I do on the right side versus the left side why does it get tired a lot quicker on one side versus the other side these are all great questions guys and matter of fact they especially in the realm that I work in and pro athletes these guys have developed pretty significant imbalances because in some instances these imbalances work in their favor as you can imagine a baseball player you know somebody that relies on rotational power it right versus left depending upon what side that guy uses primarily but for us in the gym who want to try to give overall well-rounded physique and also even strength levels imbalances are crushed enough so there that you have to look at first coordination and proprioception with coordination proprioception guys what you area where I said why does it feel different why can contract the way that I can on the right hand side again bicep curl is a great example I for example for causes here if you trying to curl away if you don every component the same it possibly feel different it to mechanically put your joints at differ angles so that you may not feel the contraction the way you do on the good side let why because coordination is being able to move something through space and unfortunately the biggest enemy here guys and how you going to quickly overcome this is by not using a barbell if it is again a barbell curl start getting used to using those dumbbells why because you have to be able to independently create the curling motion right and left and get it to do the same are you supinating the same amount in the forearm do you have muscle restrictions that prevent that maybe one forearm is tighten to prevent supination on the left side which prevents you from getting that little extra squeeze here on the bicep so you want to address your coordination proprioception might get it used to using dumbbells and going through the full range of motion and making sure that you have adequate flexibility throughout your entire limb if again we the curl so that you back or inhibited in any way next up here guys neurological with the neurological causes here a muscle imbalance we strength it pounds on one hand and 45 or 50 pounds on the other and feel it equally tough here guys we have to start looking at what our our muscle activation is what is the motor unit activation how how how well patterned are we between our mind in our muscle because there can totally be differences between your right and left side especially considering that most of us have a dominant side if you are right hand dominant it uncommon to not have that nerve that neurological efficiency from your brain to the muscle in the left side of your body again in the left arm because you don looking at that being say how do we overcome this I think we have to sort of figure out a way to activate the muscle fibers and give them a little bit more alert to what we workouts and there manufacture just discussed it in our NXT program is a touch up set with a touch up set you beyond what you normally work with if you - 10 to 12 rep max of 40 pound curls then give me a 55-pound curl let me see you go above and beyond what you can you only been do three or four reps but that activate an alert the muscles to the loads that you to again not Network out but hopefully down the road and then come back to your working weight you neurologically turns on the muscles activates them to be a little bit more efficient when you go back to your working weight next up circulation problems here guys again are common a common occurrence you fatigue faster alright this is it you this happen when you when you find that one side constantly fatigues a little bit faster than the other most often guys probably due to circulation differences between sides how do you fix that you got to start incorporating some higher rep sets into the work that you constantly fatigues versus the other then start doing some unilateral again dumbbell high rep sets to that side to try to improve the circulation you know studies will show that capillary density which is going to be bringing more blood flow to that area will improve if you train the area through higher reps so more oxygen deprivation get those rep sets up to fifty or so you see that you can improve the calculator density and by doing so help get more blood of time that you can perform those sets finally guys number four here genetics now you know how about once you use genetics as an excuse especially having come from such a skinny past to be able to have added lean muscle into my adulthood guys genetics though will play a part and have your muscles look there that have chests that sort of go inward bony structures that actually go in ways that they not something you can overcome shorter limbs longer limbs longer muscle bellies those are all things that are genetically part of the world of makeup of what you look like but that being said it doesn off as much fat you can buy followed a healthy diet and if you train properly if you don too long again I hammering home that point you treated your workout length for intensity you can maximize what you again to incorporating some of these techniques you can really easily improve these areas so even genetics you can overcome bad genetics guys if you have the right training approach hopefully you curse that you with forever now if you approach in the right way athlete necks is about approaching those things the right way guys so if you haven lean athletic muscle that aesthetically pleasing it looks great so that you can cover that aspect to look great and dominate on the field at the same time guys athlete X again is the program if you haven you come over to athleanx.com and grab our training program I hope you found this little coverage here of the types of muscle imbalances more importantly what you can do about them helpful if you did make sure you leave a comment below in the meantime we back here in just a couple days with another new workout tip for you this time addressing the very biceps will be just covered here as examples in this video until then guys have a great couple days	Success
How to Build Big Shoulders (WITH A SHOULDER INJURY!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDzWHQdLkP8	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com no unfortunately I wasn acting in those clips I actually feel like crap a lot of times when I do my shoulder workouts but I got to tell you this I still build shoulder size despite what going on inside the joint because I actually have an understanding of how to attack it and work my way around it today I want to show you exactly how to do that maybe you labrum tear like I am maybe you have a rotator cuff impingement maybe you have a biceps anion something going on in your shoulder that you don your workout you have to understand how to work around it and more importantly maybe what the bigger cause of your shoulder pain is in the first place so when it comes to the labrum for those that are suffering from labrum tears and I basically the labrum is just a cartilage insert that sits inside the socket and basically it deepens it functionally deepens the socket because the ball sits in the socket the bone itself isn really deep enough to hold the ball in place all that well but when you add the cartilage here it actually acts as a suction and it deepens the socket so the head sits in there tighter so what happens is if you tear your labrum normally the top part of the labrum it called the slap tear you tear it you basically cut the functioning of the suction of the labrum so now you don hold the head on humerus in place all that well anymore you instability so people that have labrum tears every time they try to open it or raise their arm up over their head they feel some pain most of all they probably hear some popping and clicking and snapping because the head is not held in there firmly or securely if you put your arm up here and somewhere to push on the back you some instability almost like it to come out of the socket it feel pretty gross to be honest with you now what are the culprits when you look at shoulder day and you say well there no way I can train my shoulders that not necessarily true you have to understand what things might be bothering it so let something exercises that might be the culprits if we look right here at a standard side lateral raise beside dumbbell lateral raise why might this hurt well think about it if you look at the position you straight down at your side and a dumbbell in your hand look at me right here if this dumbbell is waving me down and I don I my shoulder then I a little bit of a feeling of a dislocation downward and an instability downward because of the weight of my hand that now I have to try to initiate some power and strength from it going to happen it really good so what we can do is we can modify it if we take it away and we do this with a cable or a band it doesn matter if you can do this with a band if you set it up so that the band is in front of you a little bit since your shoulders a little bit more into flexion what it do is give us the natural tendency to want to pull back away from the starting position so now when we pull back we actually also incorporating external rotation which is going to put us into more of the close-packed position of a joint and talked about that before in our mobility videos close packed position is going to give us more stability inside the joint from the capsule so we exercise slightly and we avoiding the internal rotation that you would normally do when we pitchers which is bad advice as I told you many times here before that gives us less pain and more room inside the shoulder joint next thing we do is where we press from if you press from out here out of the side which a lot of people will tell you to do sort of military press style right up here this way you an abnormal position because when you understand that the fact that the ball in a socket the sockets themselves they don they sit like this they kind of an angle forward okay so the angling forward about 45 degrees so we lift our arms up the more natural elevation pattern is here not here so the best way to press especially if you have any type of shoulder issue whether it being rotator cuff or whatever it is is to get your elbows in front of you like this and presses I created a more natural pressing pattern we and we less pain because we increased the space inside the joint again by having a little bit of external rotation something like the benchpress now why does the benchpress cause so much discomfort when maybe a push-up does not because you hand again you got to look at what the problem is in the first place if we and you put yourself down on the bench and you lower your arms down here you can already feel the pain biting inside your shoulder and you really don strength push back again not a surprise because if you think about the fact that the bench is behind your body right here and it weights pushing you this way that way you provocative position that you would that screen because it there is no stability there your own to dislocate so it but if we can change it around I saying you have to do this permanently if you are rehabbing your torn labrum you can actually get them better they don you get yourself into a close-packed position with your hands in contact with the ground closed chain position hands in contact with the ground do a weighted push up because you to put the joint back in place as opposed to having an angle out here freely put it back bring that ball and socket together a little bit more and actually have the compression that going to feel a whole hell of a lot better you can weight it with dumbbells I weighted with a weighted vest like I showing you here something to increase that of course you can slow down the rep to increase the time under tension if need be now let culprit here the thing that people don always realize is actually causing a lot of the discomfort that comes out on shoulder day when you try to use your shoulders again and that that training and I don up your training it that tend to do the most aggravation if you have a problem in your shoulder especially a labrum tear because if you look at the exercises like a pull-up like a one-arm row what do you see here in common even a barbell row what common here is you have waited distraction of the joint that is a recipe for disaster for somebody with instability or a labrum tear or slap tear in their shoulder if you get up on a pull-up bar and the bars your weight is going down and the pull-up is pulling your arm up you lot of traction up on that arm that as soon as you again it may not even hurt the second year up there but as soon as you get off you feel like you have to go jump down and hold your shoulder right or you look at a one-arm row again you get all that weight now extend it out here and your arm all the weight pulling down on that already unstable joint I ability to hold the head of the humerus in place again my net hurts so bad soon as you let go it feels like it wants to retract in a lot of pain right and then the same thing with a barbell row bent over same thing so what you have to do is start making some modifications to your back training - you might want to go underhand into more of a punch in up as opposed to a pull-up because you can get the assistance of the bicep now sometimes because the bicep tendon attaches to the labrum you pull there I don case all that often you can actually train biceps with not a lot of pain the only bicep exercise is going to cause a lot of discomfort is a incline dumbbell curl because you putting that through the long head you pulling right on the part of the label and that position here you don ability to generate much power from there so the idea is you got to look beyond just your shoulders when your shoulders are hurting you have to look to other allies include a lot of rotator cuff training in your work because those are the only muscles that can help to support some of the lacking stability you have in your shoulder because of the torn labrum we actually never overlook the importance of rotator cuff training in any of the athletics programs matter of fact it programs because I realized that even if you don better pay attention to it because of the only muscles that you have they going to help to support the shoulder and you only get two shoulders your whole line unless of course you have to go down the surgical room you plastic ones in there I don see you have to do that unless you protect what you have I want to see you train the right way I you do that if you head over to athleanx.com you can get our training program as a physical therapist I have an eye towards not just getting you bigger stronger and aesthetically more pleasing but also to keep you functionally strong and healthy for the long run all right guys I hope you found this video helpful I know it was sciency it was you know a little bit nerdy I get it but the idea is there people out there suffering from labrum tears are going to find this beneficial even more so people out there I want you to avoid these or whatever other problem you got your shoulders you can still make gains you just got to figure out a way to work around them alright guys I back here again in just a few days	Success
Shoulder Press Solution - STOP Shoulder Pressing Pain NOW!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR38_ZKKUCs	ATHLEAN - X	do you have shoulder pain when you doing overhead pressing watch today video I that you can do that will allow you to keep pressing overhead but this time without the [Music] pain what aex.com today here we about a really important issue because it that guys run into when they get into the gym and it pressing movements and I know coming from pro baseball we had a real uh attention that we paid towards overhead pressing movements because with pitchers you don right you want to make sure that they can throw and perform with their job so overhead pressing movements were always something we had to keep an eye on however in the gym the regular guy is going to go out there and he may get some pain when he and continue to do it because he doesn really know what else he can do that going to replace the ever powerful overhead pressing movement so what I talking about is dumbbell presses now it position out to the side I have a bum shoulder over here so I feel pain it takes me a few reps before I can start to feel like it feels a little bit loose but the problem here is the position of the elbow okay the second I take my elbow from the in pointing in front of me to a position out here we to a kind of a uh an extreme abductive position there when we have laborum problems for an apprehension test this is the position here you know if I were to push back on my arm here especially if I had a little bit instability in my uh in my capsule in here I could get some discomfort some pain some you know that kind of gross feeling that you get inside the shoulder like it feels like it pop right so the solution here is I still want you to be able to press overhead I just don that that position so we can move our dumbbells in or a variation we can do is we can use an Olympic Bar and throw it into a corner I don your walls if you just take a a rug or take a blanket throw it in the corner put your Olympic bar or any bar into the corner with it and then put a plate on the end now one of the greatest things that you can do with this is get up under here okay hands together see where the elbows automatically come they come in front we anymore so we bit of an athletic stance which means butt out legs knees bent and press straight up overhead okay down in here to your chest press straight up overhead down and press now you the side deltoid as as well as the front matter of fact I think you work it more effectively out of this position with your elbows in front of you because you susceptibility of instability in the shoulder and you usually press more and you have the added benefit of loading 45lb plates on here not just one but two or three to overload remember really important for getting muscle and now incorporating a little bit of a push press so we can overload by getting a little bit of help from our legs down and then up and getting a great shoulder exercise at the same time okay so really still working the delts and through here you could do one arm presses up in here press up [Music] just like that okay so now you here but the fact of the matter is it so super simple to set up and we don have to sacrifice what would be a great movement and overhead pressing movement and we can still get the great results that you need to get guys if you haven already head over to aex.com and get the training program that teaches you how to do this it teaches you how to overcome maybe some limitations that you have remember as a physical therapist when I wrote this program I wanted to do it in a way that not only made sense to me but made sense with science but also made it practical for everybody not guys that are in perfect condition with guys that might be a little bit banged up that might need some tweaks to get around certain issues but both most of all get you in the gym consistently so that you can get consistent results guys I you over to aex.com in the meantime thumb this video up if it helped you or if you have shoulder problems and this seems to help alleviate some of those in the meantime guys I days [Music] [Music] la [Music]	Success
Knee Pain with Lunges (HEREÂS YOUR SOLUTION!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q59ZvPhpySM	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com so you doing your leg workout you get ready do your lunges and guess what you get that sharp digging deep pain and you decide what are you gonna quit the workout you can skip the exercise entirely or are you gonna try to bear it through it and feel even worse in the morning well neither one of those is a good choice because the fact of the matter is the longer you continue to do those movements that are causing you pain right now the more long-term damage you away at forward lunges if they causing you pain is not the right answer but what I can tell you is lunges may still be the answer you see I show you here the big difference between reverse lunges and forward lunges as it relates to the knee pain that you might be feeling with doing the exercise and how doing a reverse lunge can actually help to eliminate all the problems that you me demonstrate here you can see as I step out into a regular forward lunge the first thing I want you to notice is what that that front leg is in an open chain position so the stepping leg the one that work is open chain to start the exercise meaning the foot is not in contact with the ground this causes a problem because we force and shock the moment the foot hits the ground and is doing that and already semi compromised position for guys that have knee pain because you can see that as I demonstrate here on the skeleton when the knee is already partially flexed here you on the quadriceps an eccentric load going on the quadriceps that directs the force through the tendon that is attached to the quads are attached to the patellar tendon and then the quadriceps tendon patellar tendon that cross here and put compressive force on the patella itself so we know that with this already in a stretched aseptically loaded position when it when the foot makes contact with the ground you get those horses that get directed right up into this already stinging patellar tendon and it feels like a knife digging right into your knee that situation so why is the reverse lunge is that much better well let you can see when I get ready to do the reverse lunge first of all that front leg starts in stays in a closed chain position so the foot stays contact with the ground and the moment we start the exercise until that we complete our very last rep so number one the stability of the front leg and the stability of the knee is enhanced number two as we step back you can see very subtly that the front hip the one that we into a little bit more flexion than it does we forward lunge this actually helps to relieve some of the pressure going through and directed through the patellar tendon because that one of the four quad muscles is actually in a more relaxed position the rectus femoris we know crosses the hip so the hip is in more flexion here we know that it more of a slack or relaxed position so therefore less accumulated force through the quads across the patellar tendon into the patella itself that can lighten the load and the forces that you feeling through here and mainly the pain that you knee when you take that step and then finally because we that forward step we that anterior force in this direction along this vector right into our anterior patella here or in front of our knee instead we and back so the force goes through the quads a little bit more so for you guys that have had a hard time even a feeling the lunge exercise as much as you should in the quads the reverse lunge is going to be a better option anyway you see guys here at athlean-x we like to put the science back in strength it is for no other reason that it actually helps us to train better it helps us to train more safely in the long run by training more safely we can actually load up our weights a lot more we can train the legs the way they actually start seeing faster results this is what it like an athlete means getting faster results by training your body the way it athlean-x if you complete training program head to athleanx.com and get our athleanx training system in the meantime whatever else it is that you everyday in the gym the aches and the pains as a physical therapist guys I can target some of those with those these videos to directing them towards the problems that you me what about them I some videos in the future here but in the meantime found this video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below and I a couple days you	Success
Elbow Pain When Working Out (WHY & HOW TO FIX IT!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_93yIKub98	ATHLEAN - X	it area right here is enough to take down even the toughest guys in the gym when it gets injured today I to you about why it happens and more importantly what you can do to make sure it doesn athle x.com elbow pain when you lifting it debilitating injuries you can face if you actually one of the most longstanding issues once you have it anybody that trained for any length of time has probably had elbow pain at some point that kept you out for a long time or made you alter the exercises that you there we going to be either on the inside of the elbow here or it outside of the elbow right here okay that elbow and what we call golfer tennis elbow again being on the outside here and golfer inside but guess what guys this isn the problem the elbow has nothing to do with it this elbow problem is a wrist problem or it could be a strength problem somewhere else compensation is what causes the elbow to take the brunt of your weakness or your immobility so what I want to do today is show you what golfer importantly what you can do to fix it and then how you can get back in the gym if you while with it so let this right now guys we our forearm if you want to identify these two points what you have to do is just take your arm here take your fingers kind of like in an L shape here and just put it right over the top right in the crook of your elbow when you reach around and grab where your thumb goes here this is the medial Epicon that flexors attach all these muscles here that flex your forearm if your ones on the outside here with your fingers that going to be your extensors in your forearm that do this those all attach out here we have two things that go wrong whether it be in in medial or lateral the problem is either you are overusing the muscles in in a in a weakened state or you have an inability to control the Ecentric contraction of that muscle so let a look first at the medial elbow all right so let inside elbow and again I think it most common source of pain guys will get the inside elbow pain because they not strong enough when they their pulling exercises this is a pulling exercise flaw if you take this band we try to simulate what with our muscle it basically is going to take you know they from the wrist here they take all the common flexors inside the fingers they all come together and then they attach right here up on the inside of the elbow so when we pull up on here it actually pulls the wrist up now when you an exercise like the chin up as I demonstrating here you can see that as I do what do most people do when they trying to cheat the chin up they curl their forearms they use their forearm flexors cuz they either don their back or their biceps to get them up to the bar so they use the help of the forearms the problem is then on the way down after they forearms in as they come down they let that just kind of flop back into a straighten position so you this Ecentric overload that is way too much for your your uh for flexors to handle you weight of your body being attacked with an Ecentric chin up you know that enough you it adequate strength to handle that unless you or you do what I tell you in a little bit here to fix this say uh same thing on a row if you look here back at the skeleton if I row and I the row you know the the weight in here like a seated row again as I get here how do we feel as if we get that bar a little bit closer how do we get that how do get that handle a little bit closer to our to our belly like we out the movement we do it by just curling the wrist in you know using the forearms to flex in it pulls it without actually having to get our elbow any further past our body it illusion we want to feel as if it getting to our chest but we know we can our rids and back alone so we cheat it and we pull with the forarm and again what happens when we come out we usually straight in the arm and again an Ecentric overload here on the middle of the elbow so two examples there again I usually of the muscles that you training causes you to compensate and use the muscles that probably shouldn be doing the work yeah they assist but they shouldn do all the work and I you again what you should do to fix it matter of fact let now okay so if you want to try to get rid of that medial elbow pain the first thing you start to stretch that out a little bit it inflamed you to take some time away from the gym to let that calm down all right but you going to want to stretch that out by straightening the elbow and then extending the wrist right because it crosses you uh muscle here so you straighten the elbow you uh extend the wrist back stretch it out hold it do that a few times uh each day ice it if you need to when it starts to feel like you capable of getting back in the gym the key thing here guys is neutral wrist position I don drop the waight that you again as I do this chin up instead of letting myself go into the cheap version of this by pulling my down towards me and activating my forearm flexors let keep a neutral grip better yet if I even had a bar that I could do a neutral grip on where I could keep my hands side you know facing each other and again not bending back or not bending forward that would be a great option especially as you drop the weights a little bit reinforce the neutral wrist which is here again Not Bent this way at all and also not bent backwards and keep that for all of your movements that you pulling movements uh for in your workout and you should start to see that this will get better and better and better over time and you overcome that long term you want to start including forearm work to make sure that your forarms are adequately strong to handle these stresses if you encounter them again but you should be getting better at being able to control the wrist flexion all right so let the elbow now we have the exact opposite situation again the muscles cross through the wrist and then they come out to the outside elbow on the top part up in here okay and when you get that pull of the mus muscle you an extension back here of the wrist like that now where I see the problems here is not necessarily it although it does happen with the Ecentric overload here too but where I see the problem is it from this chronic extended ham position that the the um that we were in when we dumbbells as you can see here you can see that the muscles are chronically in this contracted shortened State on the back of our forearms the overuse comes here this is where some people will break down even at a computer desk because they position with their wrist bent backwards and these muscles constantly on the go you your muscles are prepared for that you do that with a lot of high rep extension uh training when you forearm work but if you for that and you go into the gym and you try to do that especially if you trying to prevent um a weight from falling away from you right if you doing some kind of a uh of a high pull right and you your your wrists are bent back that the weight really really want to make sure that it doesn really going to be working hard that could be where the Ecentric portion comes in the overload but more more importantly we see that with tennis players again they wrist position as they get ready to hit and what happens after they hit and they release the wrist just naturally follows through and that eccentric pull on the back of the forearm here is a lot of times enough to cause a micro tear in these muscles that causes the inflammation so the point is even here in the gym if you to grip things you try to grip with a more neutral grip if you pick up those dumbbells try to do it like I neutral uh uh position of the wrist it not that natural because naturally our wrists go into a little bit of extension because it a stronger grip but if you with an inflamed position you either aren you modification to help you come back and get over the issues that you so for the time being you want to try to be uh sure you neutral grip so there you have it guys hopefully Raymond and myself were able to not only help you to identify what might be caused and the source of your elbow pain but help you to make sure that it doesn for all that long you got to remember you got to start stretching it out whether it be the backside or the underside you got to apply some ice to control the inflammation in the early stages but when you into the gym you got to start making these modifications doesn long term but right now it has to be taken care of until you can adequately build up the strength and endurance in your forearm muscles with more direct Forum work in fact we have a complete Forum workout here that I posted quite a while ago but it still uh definitely applies you can check that out on our Channel as well if you guys found this helpful make sure you leave a thumbs up and a comment of what else you see and if you want to put the science back in strength guys and start training without worrying about getting injured without worrying about missing time in the gym because the workout you leaves you beyond the point of even being able to function that thing right then you got to head over to athletex decom as a physical therapist I created a program that I feel not only helps you get bigger stronger faster but keeps you healthy in uh during the process so head over to aex.com right now in the meantime guys I will see you back here in just a couple days	Success
Working out with a Shoulder Injury (YOU CAN IFÂ)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdIgoJ1G0o	ATHLEAN - X	what you pull-ups or when you hanging from a bar doing any kind of ab work we got to do something about it you see because pain in those movements is usually something that away but there are ways that you can tweak the movement itself to make the exercise one that you can do and continue to get gains now coming from a the the the world of professional athletes shutting someone down completely for the season is never the best option It option you have and it option if we can maximize what you can do with the function you have and we can continue to build strength everywhere else that what I here today in this video so if you this hanging position what is going on what possibly could be causing the problems well first of all the position itself is pretty extreme if your arm is way up over your head it at end range end range flexion okay end range flexion could be a problem for anybody especially if you Mobile in the first place but then you add to it the force of gravity pulling your body down and that can cause some issues especially if you have a laum tear now for you guys that don what the laum is I know you heard about it but don know what it is I right here on the skeleton here we have our Raymond x-ray he inside of his shoulder joint what lines this ball and socket capsule right inside of the socket is the lab it basically is a lining around the entire B uh socket portion of the ball and socket now it acts as a suction cup it provides suction so that the head of your humorist sits in that in that socket and actually stays there with some stability what would happen if you got a tear in your laum which I happen to have from taking someone up a a bet years back with the Mets that I could throw a baseball so far yeah I won the BET and I blew out my shoulder like an idiot the uh the lab when it gets torn is no different than a suction cup if you took a suction cup and stuck it to a window it would work but if you then took a little knife and cut just a little sliver into that suction it no longer works because the air can no longer be trapped there differential and pressure between the window and that suction cup well the same exact thing happens here so if you have some sort sort of a laum tear you want to go hang on that arm usually you don go because it rebound pain that you tear mostly again characterized by feeling it after you let go which is what I sort of deal with with my shoulder If instead you get pain just when you get into this position okay and even worse as you start to do more and more reps that could be because you have impingement in your shoulder and any time you put your arm up overhead you going to have more and more problems if you have impingement going on to to figure out the the actual diagnosis and that again that would be more pain during the movement but to figure out the actual diagnosis is always a good idea to see if you can uh get an evaluation by a physical therapist here use in either case first of all what are you doing with your shoulders if this is what you look like at the bottom of any hanging leg raise or pull up then you already have problems why because if you could turn your head and hit your chin into your chest or into your shoulder over here and make contact with that then you properly for stability and again if we have this unstable or this this compromis laum we don as it is we that so we need to have stability some other way we need to have other muscles kick in and help out and we could do that by making this simple tweak if this is you right now the first thing you want to do is try to keep your elbow straight and raise your head up okay once you do that now if I turn left and right I don at all I stability I already get my traps I get my rbid and I even have other muscles inside the joint itself here that are contributing to make this joint a lot more stable okay so now when I do my my exercises whether it be the hanging leg raise or the pull-up I prepared and ready to do that the next thing you can do is if you have that much pain first of all again be evaluated but secondly if you have that much pain you don stick to pull-ups for now you can change to chin-ups and by changing to chin-ups you incorporate the biceps to help you with some stability and when we externally rotate the arm to get into the chin up position we get the rotator cuff to kick in as well so you don hanging leg raises and that solution by the way if you can anything up here for hanging leg raises but you still want to get the benefits of those more difficult exercises then use the Roman Chair where you sit with your forearm supported on pads like I said it you you that 90% of my guys that are watching this video right now have some sort of discomfort when they hit the gym that you have to train like that or skip workouts because of the pain there usually something you can do that allows you to avoid a little bit of discomfort but still continue to work on getting stronger overall and really in the long run it will it will accelerate your progress in your rehab and getting back from these discomforts if you can figure out ways to continue to train but avoid that pain that there and that athletex guys I think it this that separate us from what a lot of other programs out there offer as a physical therapist I feel like I can bring to you guys a little bit more of the science behind what we do so we can start helping you guys train at a whole new level if you haven join team athl and head to aex.com and get our athletex training system and in the meantime if you found this video helpful and you continue to like these sort of PT videos and explaining why and what and what goes on when you training then make sure you leave some comments and a thumbs up below and the other things you address and I a future video I	Success
IT Band Syndrome and Knee Pain (HOW TO FIX IT!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYb9vyj6zQ	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what today I want to talk to you about a pain that a lot of people will get either running or jumping or biking or when they at the bottom of a squat that runs usually on the outside of your thigh could feel really really tight or could burn and be very painful or right here on the outside of your knee you may have been told that what you have is IT band syndrome ilot tibial band syndrome and that sit here and I see it all the time I see people grab a foam roller here get on that side of that leg like this make all kinds of faces cuz it really does hurt and they think they fixing their problem when all they doing is actually making it worse because as you today the IT band is not something that you can change the tension in by directly attacking the IT band this is just a 10in structure that actually has the ability to resist up to 1,000 lbs of force so if you think that putting your own body weight on top of a foam roller or I don the lacrosse balls it ain anything to change what that IT band however if you understand where the IT band is in your body and what it actually does then you can start to figure out that maybe there better way to go after it the IT band is actually going to sort of of mirror this line of my pants here it thick ten t t uh tenis band that goes down again the lateral aspect of my thigh and inserts here on the just past um my uh onto my tibia past my knee joint so the things that happen here though is that we have muscles that feed into it so we have primarily the tfl the tensor fascia that and I cuz we if we want to fix it band syndrome once and for all and we also have a lateral aspect of our quads so our vasis lateralis we have our glute Max that feeds into it from back here we even have posterior hamstring because again if you look at this white line it feeds right into the white line from back behind and again as I said the quads feed into it from up top well all those muscles and primarily the ones from the top here again especially the tfl it uses this IT band as its own tendonous attachment to the aspect of our knee so you the tension in the tendon by going after the tendon but you can change the tension in the tendon by going after the muscle that attaches or feeds that tendon and that all of our time doing so if you getting pain like I said when running or biking or jumping or in that bottom portion of a squat and you don what looking up here at the hip and especially the tfl if you want to start making some changes so here two-step plan for you to really attack back that most of the time I find that the two biggest offenders of this IT band are going to be that lateral aspect of the Quad because a lot of times quads will get very very tight on most people especially those that are doing those activities I just mentioned and also really really big this tfl so the tfl actually this is what it sort of looks like or where it is I little bit here I little bit but the idea is right here is the iliac crest we have the top of our hip B you can actually feel it and if you reach around in front you should be able to feel a bump right here on the side of my you know I got these muscles kind of in the way but you can feel this bump on the front side of your pelvis that kind of grab a hold of there with your thumb and then make a fist in this general area is where our tfl is all right it very very big muscle but it feeds right down as you can see into that white line here which is going to be Our IT band so what we want to do is we want to get into position and put pressure on that we don necessarily but if you have a foam roller that that but what I like is something very low profile this happens to be a fat grips now I they happens to work really well this is very resilient uh material here it doesn really deform very much at all you can use tennis balls put together you can put the lacrosse balls and put them together but whatever Implement you using use it right and this is how we want to use this you find that area right there in the hip you sit right on top of it okay and you push your hip right there on on it okay so I feel it now pushing I feel pressure underneath now what we want to do is we want to kind of floss the muscle through its range of motion that it through when we run when we jump when we squat that means we have to flex our hip if we can we try to keep it in contact with the ground so I little bit so you can see this even more right here you want to keep this in contact with the ground and I basically flexing up and that hurts because I right Contracting the muscle and taking it through this sort of flossing I pushing down in this one spot and then dragging it under and through dragging the muscle under and through kind of rolling out the issues without just rolling back and forth on a roller and I with with that leg up and down this is really like an Active Release Technique an art technique we up and then down we flexion and we can do the same exact thing here by putting it down lower now onto our quads you just turn it uh in a long W Direction here so now you put it just to the outside so you on the quad here we after the IT band that side of our pants here cuz that going to do like I just told you you got to come to the front now we in the front now we try to do is take your other foot block your leg from moving further anymore okay and then try to bend your knee back so we stretch the quad that way now I don very very tight quads so I to feel this as much and if you don feel it move on guys the whole point here Mobility drills is to only do the ones that you need don doing mobility work work that you don need if you go through this motion and you don likely don don have a tight tfl though that might need to be addressed or it does need to be addressed if you want to start changing that overall impact that feeding down into the IT band so again you work here and you just go through that quad contraction the purpose of this leg is a lot of times guys when they bend their knee if they have tight quads will find that the knee will shoot forward because you some of the tension off of that quad that want to let that happen you want to keep it back in a stretch position and then Flex the knee but those are the two moves for me as a PT that I find most often are the ones that you want to address the tight vastus lateralis the outside of the quads and the tight tfl those will feed tension into the IT band making it really really tight without going having to go after and try to compress it with a foam roller on an already compressed structure that doing nothing but pushing down on the things beneath it that makes that pain even worse so guys if you take approach a smart approach to Mobility you got to start thinking through your Mobility a little bit more don somebody showed you do the things that you actually really need and that whole point here guys make sure that no matter what you you do the exercises that your body needs if you point Z you take the 26 letters of the alphabet and you do those things that gets you from from point A to point Z the fastest that here at athletex is give you guys a plan to get you from point A to point Z without any wasted motion without any wasted effort so that you can make sure that the most you out of what the time that you spend training guys if you program that does that head to aex.com and get our athex training system anytime if you continue to find these videos helpful make sure you let me know again it goes a little bit over the realm of just Bro Science to the point where we and helping you understand more what

How to Fix Muscle Imbalance (EQUALIZE YOUR SIZE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgOzIfeyXyY	ATHLEAN - X	[Applause] [Music] what athleanx.com as a physical therapist I get paid to analyze movement I get paid to analyze my athletes performing because I know that if I can watch them perform I could pick up slight things that I may need to then take it to the weight room and help develop even further to overcome imbalances to develop more strength where a weakness might lie well the same thing again exists right here in the weight room if you if you want to eliminate muscle imbalances you better be good at analyzing your own movement and it starts with a simple mirror if you going to train at home I don from Walmart because it could become the most effective tool that you used to start fixing muscular mounts why because I believe that 99% of all muscle imbalances are rooted in one thing and that deform it to the point where they obvious there you can become very good at picking up on them if you start paying attention when you examples of exactly what I about posture performers will come from we I sitting back usually leaning to my right side or if I on the computer I got my right arm up over here I one side what does that do well it only takes a few days of that to start getting some muscle adaptations in that same to reflect that same posture so we higher left shoulder a little bit depressed right shoulder well watch what happens when I take that posture into the weight room without correcting it or paying attention to it when I do without the use of mirrors I go to a back workout I a row I side well why is the pattern in this this elevate this elevates the elbow a little bit up here and I pull back in this elbow is usually down at my side and I get a much more significant contraction here in my lap because my elbow is doing what it duct into my side while here it staying out because the elbow the shoulders are taking it up and away from my body it my last ball it for my bad posture so if I can get a much stronger contraction here we already know from past videos that we not developing the prop of my muscle connection on this other side to ever properly develop that lap or fully develop that laugh it oversight we let same position here what happens I try to go down into my squat well a little bit tilted our bodies have mastered our masters of compensation we to allow it to go straight down like this we know that going to work so what happens is the left knee will have to beg more than the right to bring us back to level well that yeah we might be level with this left side is doing a lot more than work than the right side is so you might develop a stronger left quad and more importantly a weaker right quad or that left quad will take on so much work or the compensation will be so bad that your knee will start to hurt on the left side so has has that really given you a proper recovery from this bad posture no all you it but if you were working out in a mirror you saw this light this slight movement imbalance from left to right you can fix it and when you can fix it you can train that way a lot of guys will try to use a technique where they lift a little bit more weight on the right side I do a few extra reps on that weaker side yeah those are okay techniques guys but I think if you most of these things are rooted in our own postural imbalances then it becomes more of an issue of fixing it at its root costs and the way you get a Fixodent root cause is to identify it first with that mirror last example a lot of us have this rounded shoulder posture right foreign shoulders what does that do for our tricep training if we we tend to be a little bit more rounded and develop internally this side right versus our left we know that the tries step two fully contract needs to be back and extend it behind our body a little bit one of those main functions there one of its functions is to at least extend the arm behind our body so the arm that the triceps like that all right from here out in front of us but when we can actually get the triceps back behind our body here now we have the entire tri-state contracting is fully and strongly as it possibly can and we get a better development overall so the guy that has one arm smaller than the other guess what the problem again might be rooted in the fact that you have these small imperceptible imbalances possibly between your right and left sides that unless you stick yourself in front of a mirror and see that what you pull downs or push downs that this side is more rotated around than this woman the other one is you want to fix it okay so we don the luxury of having a guy like a PT like me to be able to follow you around and tell you when you things so you guys start training yourself to spot these imbalances in your posture so you can get rid of them in your training you can you can you can definitely get rid of you just got to start paying attention to those that exist in training even if it means life of the wait just a little bit so you can develop that mind-muscle connection a little bit more and start taking your movements through in a very balanced way you you might not have a PT at your disposal I can do this for you but it doesn mean that you don same programming and with that guys you can get the athleanx training system in my training system I give you the exercises the step-by-step meals of meal plans day-by-day workouts everything you need to equip yourself to train at the top level just like my pro athletes do to train there but I teach you also the tools you you through those workouts you get the most out of every single one of them alright and that that all about so we making sure that everything that it needs to be inflation your workouts is there and again the entire system and athleanx.com in our athleanx training system I hope you found this video helpful and you can start to see where some of those imbalances that you thought you might have it than the other it has a root cause in some sort of postural imbalance that you could set something that you set up yourself because of the way you stand or position yourself all day long but it can and attention to fixing it alright guys found this helpful like I said leave a comment and a thumbs up below and whatever else is that you like to see make sure you leave those below too and of course I the coming weeks see you guys [Music]	Success
How to Fix Uneven Pecs (2 WAYS!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeTNtWyn-0g	ATHLEAN - X	hi my name is Sarah hill from Laredo Texas and my AHF question is how can I properly form my pecs I following your workouts and I do get results on both muscles I do feel the growth I feel more like my right PEC has better shape and I want to see how I can balance them out and have this one start forming properly so any tips you can give me would really help what question that is a great question it actually very very very very common matter of fact yours truly doesn balanced pecs you see if you look here at mine you see that basically this PEC here my left PEC kind of takes a sharp turn and heads out this way whereas this one kind of comes all the way down to the top here of my abs and it comes over and it makes its turn so what causes it what can you do to fix that if that your issue nothing you see it about how your muscles attach and here as they attach to the sternum for whatever reason this here this area is just not attaching all the way immediately as much as the my PEC on my right the fibers come all the way here and attach right on to the sternum whereas here they just don the way across they attach her to the very outer portion remember your sternum is going to kind of splay out here at the bottom so they the outer portion of the sternum they obviously you still have to connect to bone in order to be anchored but they attaching way further out on my sternum and let coming all the way onto the top right down the midline so if that problem though if there let smaller than the other that problem can be addressed in two different ways number one you want to do a little bit of unilateral work because especially if you first thing I want to do is swap in some dumbbells because we bring the dumbbells into play it forces you to be a little bit more in command of each side individually right you want to try to move them together so it cause you to not be able to rely on one stronger side than the other the second thing you can do actually part of that so that those dumbbells in your hands try to put down the one on your strongest side and do the one on your weaker side by itself I know it sounds crazy it might actually increase the length of your workout but it squeeze and try to gain more muscle control over that muscle likely if it a lot smaller than the other I bet you to contract that muscle and they are independent of each other you can have one that and something more in control of what you do than the other so especially if you so what you squeeze and let the other hand be your guide it should be doing something should just be hanging out here so touch right on the the fibers of the chest here and as you contract try to make them contract hard under your fingers try to make the muscle do the work okay that you can do is to just add a little bit of additional volume to that side so on another day when you movement or pushing muscle group right you can come in with some additional one-arm chest work on that day to increase your overall volume for sort of a work cycle so if you body over the course of a week or five days or eight day whatever your training cycle is you want to get a little additional volume per cycle in you could do that by incorporating a few added sets of that same side and again work your way up as you can and wait you see that just with that additional mind muscle control if you with an issue like I am that you going to start to see those pecs balance out so - I hope this helped you and I hope anybody else out there that dealing with especially a PEC imbalance that this will clarify at least which direction you you really can something you do have an opportunity to guys this is the axe Jeff question remember you can get your question answered here on our axe Jeff videos once a week if you send your question to media relations at athleanx.com remember video question guys send it over to me and I right here on this channel I guys back here soon we got more videos here coming for you four times a week so I got some work to do I here soon	Success
STOP ANKLE SPRAINS (In Just 3 Quick Exercises!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bP24FFkQ54	ATHLEAN - X	are you a chronic ankle spainer it could be that you opposite of what you should be doing when you recurring and I exactly what you should be doing [Music] today what athleanx.com if you are a chronic ankle sprayer right and we know that normally once you do sprain an ankle is something that usually happens over and over and over again and then sometimes one sprained ankle on one side can lead to a sprained ankle on the other side because of compensation so what I wanted to do today was show you in a video why what you might be focusing on is exactly the opposite of what you should be focusing on to prevent that from happening I put up a little chart here now we know that whenever we really our whole body we want to have that perfect balance between mobility and stability right you are an athlete when you are perfectly balanced between mobility and stability matter of fact even when we strength that you could generate we talking about the perfect balance between mobility and stability right we I showed with the rubber band a long time ago so when we look at individual joints though we want to apply the same two criteria what is the mobility what is the stability of the joint and the things that are going to basically provide Mobility or stability or going to be our muscles our joint in our ligaments so let me give you one quick example in the shoulder if we look at the shoulder between mobility and stability well the joints in the shoulder they need to be mobile it very mobile joint and even if you looking at Athletics and requirements whether it throwing a baseball the the mobile the mobility of the shoulder has to be there for it to function properly this the the muscles themselves need to be strong enough and toned enough to give us stability of that joint though so we talking about again the shoulder the rotator cuff so we want stability from our muscles we want Mobility from our joints for our shoulder and of course ligaments almost always provide further stability for that joint when we go to the ankle the ankle is very much the same but the problem is we do things exactly the opposite so if you think about what we do when we work on our ankles we always trying to to stretch our calves we calves out to to make our ankles feel looser right and we trying to a lot of times athletes especially tape our joints right tape our ankles to provide stability what I telling you guys is we want to do the exact opposite we don want mobility of our ankle joints we want stability through our ankle muscles okay so that being said we have to consider maybe a little less calf stretching more stability type exercise and we can cover that in a different video but what I wanted to deal with today is the joint Mobility so let me take you over here and I exactly what I about I days here to Spring training and you guys know that I for many years one of the things you can recognize immediately if you go to any training camp is guys doing leg swings right the drill where they come out and across their body a lot of guys think that the leg swing drill is utilized to stretch this leg okay stretch the groin on this side okay the outside of the hip over here and it is a good active or dynamic stretch for that purpose but that valuable a matter of fact for our chronic ankle sprayers the guys that are watching right now you need to start doing leg swings routinely because we want to start adding some Mobility to your ankle so here you want to do firstly you want to work the three different planes of motion so we sagittal plane our frontal plane which is side to side and most importantly our transverse plane so if you look at it the three things that I want you to start doing are start reaching forward and coming back start reaching forward and coming back reach forward Don Touch come back what you exaggerated dors flexion here and I can actually take my shoe off you exaggerated dors flexion of the ankle so you ankle each time trying to reach out a little bit further with that toe okay just like that and don knee going past the toe guys this is not a loading situation this is a Mobility drill at that ankle okay that first move the second move we want to get into the frontal plane so what we want to do do is actually have our ankle go into pronation and then supination okay so the way we do that is we going to lean our foot out to the side but lean our body to the other side okay so we lean that way and we come across so you can see the ankle caves in okay it travels in the knee flexes it travels in then we want to come across the body you can immediately see how it rolls out okay so we and across and then in and across there lot of Mobility going on down there okay and then finally transverse plane is incredibly important because remember we move in three dimensions and there through whatever we do in every lift we do I don the gym there forces with everything we do so what you want to do is utilize our uh our leg swing across our body the key here is you want to keep this heel down on the ground so basically we to come across point the toe up in the air as high as you can and then come across rotate the leg out and point the toe up in the air so all this winding around is giving us this sort of stress on my left ankle on the ground okay so watch again as I come across up and then to the side just like that heel stays down what you tight you start twisting out to the side just like that every time it turn further and further in that direction you got bad Mobility likely you wind up spraying that ankle and likely once you do that you it over and over again so again plant that foot down and work on your leg swings could even be just 20 each Direction okay not to mention you good Dynamic stretch of the on the right side so guys you might be thinking backwards when it comes to your ankle you want to make sure that you the right things get your mobility in your joints get your stability through the muscles and obviously you want to keep those tendons and ligaments tight those are the things that are going to give that spray ankle when you have the wrong balance going on between stability and Mobility those tendons those uh ligaments specifically in the ankle are the ones that give those are the things that create the uh uh the Sprain and those are things you back from if you found this helpful make sure you leave me a comment below let me know are you one of these chronic ankle sprains right you know who you are uh let me know what do you do to what are you doing to deal with it are you just one of the guys that winds up stretching your calves incessantly thinking that going to work maybe you went might to switch it up leave your comments below and a thumbs up and in the meantime guys if you want to start training like an a athlete yes I get a chance to work with some of the best in the world but I still have the ability to take what we work with and bring it right to you that that athletex training program you can get that at athl next.com guys I say it all the time

Back Pain + Exercises (HERNIATED DISCS & WEIGHT LIFTING!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMFERuFVzkM	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com bulging discs herniated disc rupture discs bad backs blown out backs you but what does it actually mean today I want to show you guys exactly what it means right here on our skeleton and more importantly tell you how you can make sure your own training that you doing the right things or avoiding the wrong things to try to give yourself the best shot of never having this happen to you now right off the bat I think it very important to clarify bulging discs and herniated this can happen to anybody at any time you don gym to have this happen so that means that any exercise can cause one of these situations to happen it can happen quickly but there are a few things that will lead ourselves to this situation much more frequently and those are the things I want to help to fortify you guys against with this video so first of all let look inside to see exactly what on so you can understand that and then we some of the situations that you might want to make sure you of when you are training all right so let exactly what here is the spine okay we have series of vertebrae here that stack on top of each other as you guys probably know and they levels of the spine that we hear so often right cervical spine from here down through the neck and then we have our thoracic spine that comes down through our mid-back and then we have our five lumbar vertebrae that make up our lower back okay now come back around to the front when we talk about the discs you can see these brown structures right here in between provide spacing and padding between our vertebrae when they natural state well what happens is when we have a herniation you can look down here you actually get a leakage of the material that Causton the nucleus for pulsus right as this thing comes out and squishes out it literally is like a jelly doughnut effect this would be a nice intact jelly donut if you were to squeeze it then it would bleed out this inner disc material that then as you can see pushes and hits one of these nerve roots that then travels down to the you know throughout the body right down to our lower extremities we have different dermatomes that these different nerve roots run to so when we train if we were to have some sort of an injury you know and I what some of these activities might be that could cause this a little bit more often than others you once you get the leakage if it root that bulging disc or a herniated disc that may not again be symptomatic because it may not be touching on the nerve root but as soon as this this material right here contacts the nerve root you going to get symptoms down that that dermatome wherever that might go and that people that wind up complaining of hip pain or knee pain or thigh pain or even numbness or tingling down the toes because it depends again on what level and what nerve root this is pushing on all right so back in the real world here what we really care about as guys lifting or we want to know what are the activities that might lead to this situation more often than others and again there can cause this but the issue is you want to make sure that we fortify ourselves as I said as much as we can the first thing guys core strength we need to know that we have the appropriate core strength and it please you guys know that ABS alone are not your core your your abs are just one portion of your core your hips your lateral trunk flexors and stabilizers are going to be incredibly important to contributing to your overall stability so side planks and other exercises that incorporate more than just your crunching activities of your abdominal muscles is going to be key to fortifying that core to make sure you have the stability of your entire trunk but that being said the biggest culprit for creating one of these herniation is in your low back is going to be a combination of flexion and rotation in the spine and the lumbar spine at the same time and more so loaded flexion and extension so exercise would that naturally be that could be a deadlift now deadlifts are probably one of the best exercises you can possibly do especially as a trainer to two athletes we know the value of a death at the functional value of a deadlift is unparalleled well one of the other areas I positioning of the hips so when I take this dowel in front of me if you lifting you have to be very very careful that not just your feet or square on the ground but that your hips are square as well so if your feet are lined up straight ahead here well my hips are open too here you can see that now if I go to do my deadlift out of that position I rotated here to the left so even though it flexion with rotation that would be something you definitely want to be aware of and alert for to make sure that then it want to talk about the squat and yet again another great exercise obviously for building lower body strength and power but it is another one that can leave us susceptible to a lower back issue especially if we already have a predisposing thing going on in our low backs that tendency to get a rapid flexion extension if you have a butt link we covered why we think that might happen other videos but the butt weight is going to be a rapid change in pelvic position from that anterior tilt to the posterior tilt and then back in the anterior and that load of the back squat the weight that you got on your back that anterior position is fine as where you get to that posterior position in getting a rapid flexion of your lumbar spine then again we talked about that components - the rotation that could cause an issue this same thing I discovered with the deadlift if the hips are open and not square you get a rotary effect of the pelvis - so the butt wink with unsquare hips is going to cause even twice the issues that we might have otherwise now what can we do to try to make sure that that doesn we can work on that butt wink and secondly what we can do is we can work on other versions of squats I proponent of single leg squats why because they allow us to continue to load up the weight not have to necessarily sacrifice our overall strain our legs which is one of the things that winds up happening when guys want to drop down the weights on a back squat to be able to execute in perfect form if the butt wink is their limiting factor they might be dropping the weights to the levels that are below that which would challenge your legs and actually help them to continue to overload but if you do a single leg version you might be able to still tap into your strength and max on your strength while at the same time protecting the low back because if not only lasts a single leg I variation so you put your leg up behind you soon as you put your leg behind you you you much more stable lumbar spine so when you go down in the flexion that lumbar spine stays where it needs to be and it stays well supported well again at the same time not sacrificing the overall strength of your legs and croisé while you you anything can cause a low back issue anything can cause a disc to to herniate or or bulge in its earlier stages the thing is you want to make sure that you prevent that from happening by training the right way and athlean-x is a physical therapist I put together a spring conditioning program that does this allows you guys to train and train hard and to train at your max but at the same time have a healthy respect for how we that we do it in a smart way so that we happen to you and injure you and keep you in the gym because the only way everything is strong the only way you going to see progressive results is if you stay in that gym and continue to train then in day out right so that what we do that it program in the meantime if you found this video helpful and you see we breaking up the skeleton and every time we do you guys tend to like these videos just let me know keep making more or whatever other issues are bothering you I it is that that might be happening to make it a little bit more useful for you thanks

Knee Exercises for Pain Free Leg Workouts (NO MORE PAIN!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZsE_TTrQBA	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what athletenext.com today i you how to never skip leg day ever again because your knees are hurting you and now it well myself that bad knees can actually really interfere with your leg training unless you have a game plan unless you have a couple big points of understanding here i get across right now in this video okay first of all what could be going on in your knees and remember it common thing that everybody sort of deals with in some way or another one you could have an acl tear or you could have torn your wrist in the past and had it repaired or maybe never had it repaired that implication on your leg training two you could have arthritis especially the older you get the more likely you gonna get arthritis that sort of comes up especially in the in the knee third thing you could have a meniscus problem maybe you tore your meniscus at some point again it causing problems it problems you finally you could have patellar tendonitis which is one of the things i deal with in a very significant way because my feet are so damn flat there a lot of causes for it but whatever it is if you have it you know what it feels like that knife stabbing feeling in your knees every time you go to try to step underneath the squat bar so what is the big issue that you need to understand to be able to start training around these pains because you can do it you have to just think what is the position of your shin this is my leg bone here is my knee what is the position of your shin during the leg exercises that you what i want to do is show you what happens to the shin during the different leg exercises so you can get a better understanding of which ones might be better for you the second thing you want to consider is what is the depth of flexion how much flexion are you getting if this is my leg straight when i go down to a squat am i stopping at 90 am i going all the way down what is the depth of the exercise that you because that too can have an implication again depending upon what is wrong with your knee so let couple of the exercises first up we have a common exercise that does tend to cause knee pain in people that have it and it you can do there do a lunge but there plane ways that you can do the lunge you can either do them forward as i demonstrating here for you or you could do them backwards as i here for you now the movement is the same in terms of what happens in your quads and your glutes you get a little bit more loading on your glutes when you step forward however if you look at the movement itself what is the position of the shin the shin on a forward lunge is really far forward it forward from vertical than it is here when i show you on a reverse lunge and on the reverse lunge i the stress away from the front of the knee or the kneecap especially if i have that patellar tendonitis or telefemoral syndrome so what is the knee depth the knee depth is actually pretty fixed it fixed especially on the reverse lunge because when my back knee comes really close or touches the floor i the movement so if you has arthritis or somebody that has meniscus problems we know that the depth a lot of flexion of the knees is going to cause a problem especially with meniscus tears you of pain and discomfort when you go to really deep flexion of the knee so this is a great exercise for you because of that but the people that have the issues with the vertical displacement of the tibia like an acl right when we lose our acl the tibia is no longer really controlled on the femur it can go too far forward same thing with patellar femoral syndrome or as i said the patellar tendons inflammation you going to get less of that stretching over the kneecap if that shin stays more vertical than it does when it goes uh past vertical next exercise we a common one the squat now here is another kind of two-pronged issue you can see that in a squat my shin does go pretty far forward right and it creates also a great degree of knee flexion if you go ask the grass which is great if you have the ability to do that if your knees are free of discomfort but if i go to a deadlift which is another great power exercise for the legs look at the difference watch how much more vertical my my shin is during a deadlift and it still allows me to load up and still allows me to lift a lot of weight and train my legs heavy without having to have all that sort of again vertical displacement that forward displacement of the shin that i would get with a squat you do have another option though if you displacement forward and keep that knee feeling a little bit better you could do a box squat as i show you here and what are we doing with the box squat not only are we getting a much more vertical shin at the bottom so taking a lot of that stress off the knee but we controlling the depth so again depth issues are going to be a problem for people that have arthritis or meniscus tears so a box squat be a great way for you to control that and also keep your knee in that more vertical position another alternative altogether and still a version of a squat is my favorite is the dumbbell bulgarian split squat and with a bulgarian split squat again now i can kind of load up the weight i can load up to even 95 pounds or 100 pounds in each hand get my knee farther out the further out that i jump my knee when i go straight down i keep my knee too close to the bench as i exercise can become more problematic for those like the acl tears like the patellar tendon problems when i go down because you can see that that shin is no longer remaining vertical so even how i set up here for this exercise is going to make a big difference but i get good i get good depth at the bottom i do get a control of it because my dumbbells are going to hit the floor before i can get all too low and of course i whole problem fixed as far as how far forward the shin goes so i love this exercise this is actually one of my favorite ways to train legs not to mention the fact that i could do it unilaterally which is more athletic finally another great option for you when you athlete especially we just talked about unilateral it you know laterally you know you know because we other when we or jumping or again being an athlete so i like the step up and the step up is another great exercise that allows us to i mean look at it i again keep that shin pretty damn vertical as opposed to really driving that knee forward and causing some pain and discomfort in the front or or or medial part of your knee and it allows me to even get really explosive if i want because i can be explosive still out of that same safe position of the tibia see i can just explode up off the bench do this plyometric version of it but i doing it out of a good position here of my knee so there when it comes to training legs you never have to skip leg day and athlean x is all about that guys i work with professional athletes who deal with knee problems all the time some nfl players who on their knees they better find a way or they job to help find ways and find solutions and we do that all the time a matter of fact like i said asta grass might be great for you if you can do it and you don knees and again there don grass is the best thing for your knees if you depends on what in the first place okay so one size doesn as a pt to make sure that i get you guys the training exercises that you need to allow you to keep training get yourself in the gym and continue to get light gains i hope you found this video helpful if you training system where i put the pt and the science back in what we do then i invite you to head to

Back Pain With Ab Exercises (WHAT TO DO)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFIaKrlY-tk	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what what am I doing down here on the floor I that when some of you are down here doing your ab exercises that you stand up you going on you something you thought was good for strengthening your core when all you doing is really hurting your back even more well the problem is that our bodies are usually too smart for our own good meaning that we are masters of compensation if we know that during a regular crunch we point A to point B we there we just may not get there the right way because muscles that aren supposed to be doing the job will kick in and do the job and in this case when you one enemy is going to be a hip flexor that is too eager to kick in and try to do the job of those weak ABS you see I you see this big muscle right here this is the soaz m this is the big muscle one of the it 18 in in length it and where it goes is it starts from the very front of your leg your upper leg and attaches through your body all the way to the back to your spine you can see the last thoracic vertebrae all the way down through every single lumbar vertebrae this muscle has attachment to that to each one of those now you can see what would happen if that muscle was too tight or contributing too much or overactive it on those vertebrae so you have your direct link you have your direct cause of back pain but we got to figure out a way to get that muscle to stop acting up when we don that with a properly executed crunch here and it and you can do it with just a resistance band and somewhere to Anchor it right what we to take your resistance band anchor it around something stick one foot through and one foot through what we for here is we want to have something that we can pull our hamstrings down into to activate both our hamstrings and our glutes to reciprocally inhibit the hip flexors see what happens is in order to create movement at a joint our bodies are smart enough again to realize that we need to shut down the muscle on the opposite side of the joint if we want to allow direct uh a motion in the opposite direction so if we bicep we have topically inhibit the triceps to allow us to move into flexion of the elbow well the same thing happens here if we could activate the muscles on the posterior side of our hips so our hamstrings and our glutes we can reciprocally inhibit the muscles on the front side the flexors the hip flexors from doing anything that we don them to do and we this crutch and we do that by just taking our feet anchoring them through this band pulling against the resistance of the band digging our heels into the ground if you don simply dig your heels really hard into the ground and squeeze your glutes up and and then from here we know that any crunch that we execute is going to rely on only the strength we have in our ABS because we flexors to contribute anymore so you really pull down as hard as you possibly can you want to breathe in deep and then ex exhale as you pull yourself up okay now what you to cut your range of motion down significantly but that doesn way up to here if all you hooking your feet under a piece of furniture at home and using the force of your hip flexors to create leverage to allow yourself to come up that helping out matter of fact that the situation worse I much rather see you do only the first 20 to 30 degrees of the motion because really the most important part is getting the shoulder blades off of the ground creating that flexion to get your shoulder blades off the ground you can do that in the first 20 to 30° and you don and you abdominal muscles so you come down here you breathe in you dig your heels as much as you can hard into the ground here try to get about a 20 to 30° Bend at your knees and you come up as high as you can and then lower down same thing dig in and then lower down again if you can get that little extra all the way up to the top up here great if you can worries you like I said that one thing and that developing the strength of the ab the true strength of the abdominal muscles so there you have it guys hopefully this video will help you if you with back pain when you training because it doesn happen right we already know you can allow muscles to do things that they not supposed to do or kick in when they want muscles that prefer to work together to work together the right way and we do that with the a next training system I tell you guys step by step workout by workout how to train like an athlete so you allow those muscles that are synergistic to work together and you try to eliminate those muscles that are contributing when we don it to work the way we want it to get the body to work the way it that again with the athletex

Wrist Pain with Bicep Curls (NOT ANYMORE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl_GlQJPy8Q	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com do you get wrist pain when you do barbell curls not necessarily dumbbells but wrist pain when you do barbell curls if you do I think I can help you especially if you pain on the inside near the pinky right here at the base of the wrist when you what might be happening and then I show you something you might be able to do to help alleviate that when we curl the problem is we with a fixed bar obviously if we using a straight bar and this fixed bar forces our hands into a degree of supination that we may not be either able to achieve or comfortable with because in order to get to a straight bar we have to really get our supination all the way up until it be able to support a bar when we use dumbbells we can kind of cheat that a little bit and have our hands even just a little bit more pronated okay in this direction so that when we curl we don have to feel that extreme range of motion well what happens there is if you take a closer look the extensor carpal nerys is a is a muscle that runs on the back side of our forearm it runs through the wrist and attaches to our fifth metacarpal our little pinky bone here when we pronate our hand our forearm here it has a nice straight path from here straight through it gets to to run with little tension and torque straight up to his destination right here again on the base of that metacarpal if we prone it superate the wrist though as we would with a barbell curl now all of a sudden I have to actually turn because I can see the difference how how difficult it is to get a lot of supination there we now have changed the path of that tendon you can see that now it doesn straight now it kind of angles off at a 30° angle what we torqued tendon you tension to it with the bar and over time if you start curling like that you don have adequate flexibility and mobility in that tendon you problems so what can we do about it you can try to increase your own supination Mobility at your wrist and what you do is you want to start by putting your elbow in at 90° and I one second and you grab the area the medy area of your wrist below your hand you don it hand Without Really Ever influencing the true superation at the forearm so you grab the medi area of the wrist here when you you stretch it for about 20 to 30 seconds you let it go grab for a little bit more range if you have it and you turn again 20 to 30 seconds let it rest and then do it again if you can grab a little bit more available range you can even do a little bit of contract relax where once you pull your hand back against the resistance for about five seconds and then let it go and you might find that you can get even a little bit more motion the next thing you want to do is make sure that you exacerbating this problem by keeping by by consciously trying to evolve your forearms in your curl we talked about that before it can cause a lot of problems even at the inside part of your elbow if when you really trying to use your forearms to help cheat the weight up the best way to do that is to try to allow your wrist to bend back a little bit Bend into a little bit of extension so that when you overusing the forearm because another way to make this problem worse in your wrist here is to combine a little bit of this uh wrist flexion with the torque here at the wrist with the from the superation and also what they call owner deviation getting your hand bent in this direction so you get those that combination of three and the position that we carrying a football they sort of diagnosed this in PT clinics if you carry the football position here which is wrist flexion aler deviation elbow superation forearm superation elbow flexion if you start feeling some discomfort and pain in here it likely that you obviously if you you likely you those two modifications try to get into a little bit of extension on your curls and also like I said try to work a little bit on the mobility of your superation in your forearm it could go a long way now obviously if it and killing you right now you might want to lay off of the straight bar curls and go to something more neutral like a hammer curl for now until that pain starts to subside and then as you get back into it you can start using some of these Mobility drills and then progressively try to get back up to the bar guys we put the science back in strength here at athlean X as a physical therapist it at a workout or look at an exercise without realizing what effect on you as a whole because if you can straight bar I think it exercise I think it ways to build your biceps and probably one of the the biggest ways that I relied on to build my biceps as I developed if you can you is it you got to make sure that we doing things the right way in the athletex training program guys again as a physical therapist I put everything in there and I progress you the way I feel you should to make sure that we addressing everything not just saying hey go do these exercises these are good no sometimes you have to look a little bit deeper than that and that try to do if you found this video helpful make sure you leave a thumbs up and a comment below I got this idea because one of you out there requested what do you do for El for wrist pain during barbell curls so whatever else is that you want to see make sure you leave your comments and it might show up here in a future video meantime I over at aex.com and I just a couple days	Success
Hamstring Injury - Your ASS is to BLAME! (literally)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdFtlHyUSXo	ATHLEAN - X	Are you dealing with a hamstring injury? If so, you blame. Literally. I what I mean [Music] today. What ax.com. Like I said right off the bat, guys, if you injury or have had some in the past, the only one to blame is you and your own ass. And I mean that literally because most often hamstring injuries come not because of the hamstrings. It the hamstrings are trying to do the role of not only themselves but the glutes. Glute inability to activate or inadequate strength is going to almost 99% of the time guys be the cause of why you blow your hamstring. So here we know. The hamstrings, their primary job is to flex the knee and also extend the hip. Not as good at extending the hip as the glutes are. But what happens is when we have weak glutes or inability to activate the glutes, the hamstrings try to kick in and help out. Unfortunately, as I said, they that good at it and they usually wind up paying the price. So, what we need to do today is show you two things. One, how do we activate them? And two, how do we strengthen them properly? So, let right to the first part. and I you right through it. All right, so the first thing we have to be able to do is activate the glutes because I mentioned it a couple videos ago, glute amnesia, meaning our inability to sort of use that mind muscle connection to get the glutes to fire, especially sequentially to get them to fire first so that it takes over and doesn hamstrings to do things that they don need to be doing. Now, one of the ways that people will tell you to isolate the glutes and try to get them to be active is to do really, really small movements. And that not looking for reps. You looking for the activation ability. How good do you get at activating? Unfortunately, here have you do. If I get down to the ground here, they ground, bend one knee up here, and then try to press your foot flat into the ceiling. Okay? Like that. But what you little bit of hip rotation because if I can enough to extend the hip, I cheat it. And the re the way I cheat it is by rotating the hips. I going to get my foot higher to the ceiling, but I rotating the hips. So, the next thing they flat on the ground so that the points of both of your hips up here doesn the ground. Okay? So that help. But what I wind up getting there is I wind up getting more knee flexion. As I try to lift the hip up, the knee is flexing more than it should. So the hamstrings once again are trying to kick in. So we don do this? Right? There developed specifically for this. And all we have to do is preset the hips so that we can take that out of the equation. Two the two faults I just showed you. You step forward with one leg right here. And then what we as you lean forward, try to keep your leg straight and lift up. Leg straight and lift up. Again here, tough to rotate because this other foot is planted into the ground and both my hands are square on the ground. So the rest of me is pretty square. So it So we can take that component out of it. Secondly, if I try to bend my knee, it not gonna pull me off the ground. I can that. Bending the knee is just going to bring my leg forward. So, really, the only choice I have here to lift my leg straight because this other leg is preset forward is to activate the glutes. And I couple and you you can definitely feel a tight activation contraction. And again, you want to get better at doing that. So work on that reps and not necessarily holding it, but the ability to continue to fire that and cause those glutes to activate. Now, we have to show you the second part of how to strengthen it the right way. So, I and show you the next part. All right, so let guys beyond these hamstring injuries once and for all. On the floor, we have a bar here that we set up. Just a regular Olympic bar. Two plates just to get it off the floor. Make sure they the same size weight so that it The concept is this. I talked about sequence. In order to have these glutes and hamstrings work together, what you want to be able to do is have the glutes do their job, have the hip extension occur, get them to stabilize the rest of the pelvis, and then we can work on the hamstrings extending and flexing the leg back and forth. So obviously they they back in, but we want to be able to make sure that as a prerequisite to that, we have the glute activation going. So for you guys having the Athlete X program, you curls. If you don could easily do this wearing socks on a hardwood floor. Okay? So just picture as I show you this, wearing socks on a hardwood floor. But for those guys that don have this thing where we have the ability to roll. Now you get down on your back, put your feet flat up on top of the bar, and first things first, you want to bridge up, extend through the hips. Everything I just showed you over there, it um you know, to do the uh activation first roll out. Then don glutes fall down. And curl in. You can see the hamstring out all the way. Pull in right here. You can see really firing but with stabilization from the glutes first. I don lowering at the same time because if you do that then you glute contribution. So get the glutes active as high as you can and then roll out and pull in without letting the hamstrings drop. Okay? So it Again hamstring injuries extremely common. One of the most common injuries that athletes and non-athletes get, a lot of it comes from our hip flexors being tight. We can address that in another video, but for the the for the purposes here, you got to be able to activate them. You got to be able to strengthen them the right way. So, we kind of cover all this stuff. As I said, the slick floor curl in the athletics program, it athlete. Whether or not you ever intend to step on the field or not, I still think it of things into our standard strength and conditioning that we do every day in Athlete X. And that complete our program don looking a lot better and looking having all the aesthetic appeal, but they also come out a lot stronger functionally. And that for me. So, if you haven guys, join me on team Athleen. Come get the Athletics training program at athletics.com. In the meantime, let me know. Try these things. Let me know how you do on those activation drills and leave your comment. And we here again in just a couple days with yet another video. Thanks. [Music]	Success
Wrist and Forearm Pain with Curls (AX JEFF!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6GYRlK7q2s	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] hi Jeff um this is Sor from India and uh my ask Jeff question is when when I doing my bicep curls I get a very sharp and a nagging pain in the this portion of my wrist and it only happens during the exercise which involves the Bobble girl so the outer parts aches a lot and I not able to twist it in this direction and this is fine this this movement and this movement is having a problem with that so thank you thanks my man for the question it question cuz this is a common problem that guys will have when they are doing the curls especially with the barbell and a lot of it is anatomical and a lot of it also has to do with how we performing the barbell curl so I why it pain in that spot right on the inside part of the wrist maybe even R radiating down into the forearm and more importantly what you can do so you can start doing curls again and not have to suffer that pain if you looked at at the anatomical part of this right we have two bones that make up our form we have the radius here and then we have the on the underside so the radius anatomically is longer than the UL so you can see right as I put my fingers on the corners of those two bones you can do this yourself just hook right on the end of your of your wrist you middle finger here is on top of the radius that than the edge and end of my Ola which is right here okay what happens is our body wants to equalize that difference so there disc that sits right in between the end of the Ola and then into the carpal bones so we kind of we close that gap down of the length difference between the two sides keep that in mind cuz now we go grab a barbell and we go try to do our barbell curls what happens is as you try to curl a barbell think about what you might do you might try to start lifting like getting more of your body English into the move to help you to lift that heavier weight well what happens is your elbows almost come underneath a little bit because what you little bit of help from your pecs as you squeeze them together you doing a little bit of a of a crossover underneath and lifting that way so as you do that you get shoulders involved too as you do that your wrists are actually feeling this type of torque and force even though they the straightness of the bar but as you do this and you weight down you supination here at the wrist well take this turn your wrist upside down okay like this bend it back and pull down and even guys that don wrist are going to find that the inside portion of the wrist right in that area where that disc is you feel some pain because you that and causing a pretty uncomfortable sensation you do that over and over and over again you could actually wear down and cause damage to that cartilage uh disc that in between the Ulta and your carpal bones so again as you curl up and you that that uh supination and downward force and that causes that pinch so the two things you can do to fix it number one are lift a little bit lighter weight because if you and you can keep it nice and strict your RIS will stay nice and neutral like this and you can probably curl it without much pain or even better if you want to start curling the heavier weight and not have the pain use an easy bar because the Easy Bar will give your wrist a chance to be in this position here so now when I curl up I of that uh that torque right there at the disc I hope you found this answer helpful I know it you start going back and focusing on the way you maybe the alternative way to do it with an easy curl bar in the meantime guys if you want to have your question answered here on Ax jef remember this is my way to give back to you guys you supported our Channel now over a million subscribers we do have a million subscriber video coming stay tuned but I want to make sure I answer more of your questions make sure you send them down here to Min relations aex.com and make sure guys their videos because the videos are going to be what I play here to answer your question all right I see you back here again really soon	Success

Hernias from Working Out (COMPLETE GUIDE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfgGwvEYZ1o	ATHLEAN - X	what dcom today we of the most common injuries in men especially guys that are working out and that the hernia than most because I two of them actually one I still have and the other one I hadn you remember a couple years ago now what is the Hern I think it we have to start off by explaining that first and foremost because because some people think that a hernia is a muscle tear it fascia tear now it muscles that are around it I explain that in a second but it in the fascia that allows some of the internal organs in our bodies to actually spill out now they a cavity so it sudden your intestines are going to start dropping out inch by inch but they there and you can actually feel the Bulge you can see the Bulge I would show you my bulge but I all my bulges if I was able to point out on on me exactly what we it the junk and you have an inle hernia most likely you see some kind of a prominent bulge there if it uncomfortable like almost like someone kicked you in the nuts what you could do if you do from time to time I actually got to lie down on my back and push down as gross as that sounds and push it kind of back inside of me now sparing all the Gory details the most important thing is if you haven you kind of have to understand what might lead you to suffer one because it is a very common injury and what you might be able to do about it so you can prevent it from even happening and I think what you have to look at is beyond the genetic component yes there genetic weakness of the faster some people others and I think that problems but the other thing is if you have a good amount of strength in your abs or a good amount of strength in your groin you can actually get some issues here you can get you can become more predisposed to having a hernia it necessarily an AB weakness that causes a hernia I think it strength but it lack of control of the other end that leads to most of the problems so having strong abs and having a weak groin can become an issue take out this piece of paper for an example if you look at this piece of paper and I pull an opposite directions on it I this thing is not tearing okay well what happens is if you take this same paper and you apply forces in an asymmetrical way so even though I with the same strength if I pull from the top and I pull from here right there all all of a sudden a quick and easy tear right one I was pulling up the other I was pulling here you can try this yourself with your own piece of paper same force that I was applying here so that ABS and the or the rectus abdominus and the groin muscles here have equal and adequate strength but if you in an oblique man manner you can have some issues which leads me to the actual exercise that gave me my two hernas now am I saying this a bad exercise absolutely not I love this exercise however there are things that we can do wrong in this exercise that would definitely predispose us to having it cause a hernia it row now watch me do this exercise here you put their leg out to the side what you pre-stretching and putting tension on the the groin right from the start okay so you you go up to the top here your core should be really activated and stable through any exercise that you do now the problem comes in when I go and I actually cheat the weight up like I showed you before and I rotate I that added stretch so we have a torque and tension and this asymmetrical situation like I showed you back here with the ABS are pulling in One Direction and the uh the groin is pulling with tension from an oblique Direction now we actually was the the same exercise twice that I felt an immediate zipper like burn I one rep pulled up tried to cheat the weight up a little bit stupid ass I W up feeling The Burning uh Sensation that was actually the tear that was occurring and then of course in the days that followed I started to gradually get a worsening of that bulge that would come out so are you supposed to abandon the exercise no not at all what you supposed to do is you try to do this exercise the right way if you to have tension in both places which you should that tension From Below tension from above you want to make sure that you keeping yourself in good alignment not just in this exercise but every other exercise that we do so preventing hernas the most you can really do is try to maintain proper alignment and maintain proper tension from above remember if you have just tension in one place and no tension in the other it to pull it in the direction of the tension right there down here and I pull up you not going to get tears there but that going to lead to a whole host of other issues having a completely weak groin that applies no tension while you have this dominant AB tension is going to set yourself up for a lot of other issues including back pain and hip issues and all that so that solution is to be balanced but to also provide your tension as best you can in equal and opposite directions so the take-home message here guys you can anything about this once you get it once you get this you have surgery how long you go before you need it it could be a very very very long time if you need the surgery recovery is definitely part of the game plan if you can get a laparoscopic surgery like I had you can accelerate that process there are certain things you won able to do for a long period of time hanging from a bar was one of the hardest things I had to do after hernia surgery because the tension that your abdominal muscles just by holding on to a bar and supporting your body weight is immeasurable right and going back to doing that after you these muscles cut through in order to repair the hernia can make it a little bit challenging however once you and add it again I just try you to be lifting heavy weights again you going to be able to do everything you were doing before you have to start trying to stay very conscientious about your form I have never been more conscientious than after the second time that I happen to me I try to be in good solid tension throughout my entire core stable From Below stable from top but I try to maintain my alignment and just like we talked about before with back issues you don under tension twisting bending over at the waist and then twisting is one of the quickest ways that you can blow out a disc when you provide that flexion with torsion it always want to try to be in alignment align yourself up align your body up with your hips align your hips up with your shoulders try to stay Square that what an athletic position is anyway trying to be very square with your body so guys if you are dealing with a hernia then there that you can do if you hernia try to focus on the things I showing you here this is just one example in this exercise and if you looking for a program that helps you to strengthen your and helps you to strengthen your lower body so you do get this good balance between the two so you can optimize your strength throughout your body then head to aex.com right now and get our athletex training system training like an athlete allows you to create a muscularly balanced physique from top to bottom in the meantime if you found this video helpful make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below wherever else it is that you want to see guys I cover it here again sometimes once a week here we break out the skeleton we try to make it more Anatomy based I hope you guys find these helpful too all right I just a few

Joint Mobility IS NOT Good for Everything (MOBILIZATION OVERDOSE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lnCP4z_dGk	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what athleanx.com so I of my horrendous drawing here the idea though is this drawing by the end of this video will become incredibly helpful for you not only in understanding more about how your body works but more importantly how you need to fix it or start thinking about how to fix it if it ever breaks down and if you you leading to more breakdowns than it might be to building you actually up and that sort of the trend that we training these days and breakdown is happening all over the place so what I want you to see is I of joints on the board here and I basically started at the foot and I work my way up the major joints and there going to be a pattern that you to see that the relationship of one joint to the next I second but the first thing you should really kind of find cool is that when we originally in the body before we become developed adults and before we become babies we upon itself when that cell start to split and open up it up a mirror image top and bottom right lower body upper body of itself so that you see joints that function very much the same your ankle is really kind of a reflection of your wrist it the lower body version of your wrist and therefore your calves are kind of like your forearms they kind of do the same thing and then down here you quads and your in your legs right your legs are just like your arms so the quads will extend the legs extend the knee the triceps will extend the elbow here so there going on uh top to bottom which makes it really uh easy to understand this next point that we have mobile and stable joints okay a joint is usually except for two big cases that are already outlined here I out usually has a role of either being mobile or stable when I mean by mobile is it give you motion you really want those joints to provide as much motion as they can to help you to move properly the stable joints aren necessarily bind down and prevent motion Al together their main role is to be able to control Mobility or to control the motion at that joint in the face of of Mobility from other joints around it so here look down here and you start the toes you ask yourself whether it or a stable joint and the main thing is that the toes need to be mobile those things need to be able to move and when they don here how it actually winds up compromising a lot of other uh areas and creating injury but that the the midfoot is the area right sort of it yeah um can the midfoot is that area sort of right in through here that reflection of the hand right right that needs to be more stable that area of the foot is a stable area because it needs to be able to as I defined it just a second ago kind of control the the emotion at that joint when you when you it needs to provide some stability your ankle though that needs to be mobile so your mobile ankle needs to provide you with enough motion if it doesn break down especially things when you squat people who lack ankle Mobility wind up having problems the knee is a pretty stable joint there the knee it not a lot of motion there it should be a pretty stable joint the hip on the other hand yes it and socket joint but it joint remember I said in the very beginning here how I point out the two areas that sort of need to be mobile and stable they kind of have a dual rle well it it ball and socket and the shoulder ball and socket but for the most part it mobile joint then you get back into the lumbar spine you want stability lumbar spine if you don that breakdown and I these in a second just get the idea here of we have stability here sorry mobile stable thoracic spine mobile got to be able to move here most people can in their thoracic spine that causes a lot of problems scapula thoracic joint they be able to ability to keep your scapula in place on your rib cage As you move your arm up that needs to be mobile I we know that stable joint here are really hard to find because people have all kinds of things going on with their scapula they got winging scapula they have tilted scapula they have all kinds of problems there back up to the up here again we want mobile because we got that ball on socket joint again but we also want to be stable for reasons I into the elbow like the knee we want that to be stable then we wrist we want the wrist like the ankle to be mobile and then you got the mid carple you want that to be stable and then you want your fingers to be mobile right you can figure this out pretty much yourself but look what happens when you look at the pattern here obviously mobile stable mobile stable mobile and stable stable mobile stable mobile and stable stable mobile stable mobile it an alternating pattern of all these and there order to have a stable joint it have that motion the mobility around it and the same thing in order to control the motion from those Mobility the the joints that are supposed to be mobile you need to have a stable joint somewhere to be able to reain it all together well when we look at what goes wrong we can talk about like I said in the beginning even at the toes if you lack mobility in your toes you might get a compromised midfoot an injury to the midfoot a lot of football players that I train will undergo uh will suffer an injury called the list fron brain and that midfoot and it midfoot was trying to be stable and when the midfoot had to contribute or sacrifice some of its stability to the toes that were supposed to be mobile but aren joint becomes less stable and it breaks down and it causes injury right if that toes aren really actually a serious problem your toes especially your big toe better be damn mobile and the problem with a lot of football players is they get really arthritic in their toes and they lack motion there well if it doesn motion from there guess what it to find it somewhere else and it to grab it from the next joint up and when it does and it reaches for that mobility and a joint that be stable that and maybe you can because you never sprained your midfoot before and you don that of you watching have had a knee injury that be a stable joint okay but it can be influenced as I said by those mubble joints above and below it what if you don you don when you you can mobility in your ankle guess what happens the knee says well I give it to you if I can I you I put all that pressure on the front of your kneecap and the patellar tendon you get a lot of problems in your knee but guess what it the first place it ankle didn the dorsal flexion to be able to allow you to go down and allow that knee to stay where what where it be instead it starts to travel forward more so you your knee is not to blame what blame is the fact that you have no mobility in a mob in in a joint that supposed to be mobile and the same thing can be said here for the hip and the same thing here when you have a lumbar spine breakdown a problem with lumbar spine normally it the hell out if it says hey well the hip isn out so you get all this motion going on through the lumbar spine all this this motion that the lumbar spine is not supposed to move that much but because it knows that it needs to get to where you need to do where it needs to be to be able to perform whatever lower body move you doing it its own stability becoming mobile that a problem it starts to break down when really what you should have done was make sure that you had the mobility in the hip to begin with so the answer is not to run out and mobilize everything that hear mobilization Mobility drills it kind of these buzzword they think it the greatest thing in the world it the greatest thing in the world sometimes you got to work on stability and not Mobility the direct opposite of what people will tell you to do I I did point out the last thing here is that some joints these two in particular your shoulder and your hip need to be able to benefit from both mobility and stability okay I talked about a few of the instances already where Mobility a lack of Mobility will cause those other areas that were supposed to be stable to give in some of their stability to help out but it also needs to be stable too I seen so many people athletes especially but really just Gym Rats who lack stability in their shoulders yeah they lack Mobility too we know that people can internal external rotation the way they should but then even when they get the mobility there you go and you start doing a bench press you can your shoulder blades you can your shoulder itself and what happens is it starts moving all around as you trying to bench and you are asking for a problem the other day I did a video on dips and how it stability in through your shoulders as you do that exercise not just to protect your chest but to actually get more out of it if you haven got to watch it right here I I I a link to it this is the video about how to actually do dips by maximizing stability of your shoulders and I telling you way more effort being done by the pecs and therefore growth in in value out of the exercise by doing it so this is a whole big ass mess of my bad drawing but the idea is simple is that you have to start thinking understand how your body actually set up and how it works understand that not everything is meant to be mobilized understand that when something does go wrong you don to look necessarily right at the source of that problem but you want to start looking above and below and figuring out where it is that you because once you know that then there a lot of things you can do to try to fix that long term as a physical therapist that least got to get you to start feeling like you can diagnose your own injuries and and issues so you at least have a better idea of how to start honing in on what found this helpful if you did leave your comments uh about it and your thumbs up Below in the meantime if you for a training program that like that puts the science back in strength I know this could be a little bit overwhelming but it to just give you the idea that we know what we sort of pride myself on not being the average YouTube guy okay I could I don need to be a YouTube guy I want to be here to be an educator and be a a resource for you guys that want to take training seriously we got our training program over at athletex decom that puts training puts the science back in strength and takes training seriously you can get your hands on that by going to athl next.com in the meantime again like I said if there want me to talk about and sort of add the PT angle to it let me know and I glad to do that here for you guys uh to the best of my ability all right I talk to you guys again real [Music] soon	Success
The HEALTHY HAMSTRINGS Workout | Prevent Hamstring Injuries!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=136r3U-Pewk	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] h [Music] H hey everybody Jeff Cavalier from mlx.com going to bring to you now we had talked about the quads before and what are some dangerous exercises straight out dangerous exercises for your knees and one of the other things that sort of gets my uh my um uh sort of blood boiling a little bit is people that are telling you hamstring workouts to lay on some kind of a hamstring curl machine um terrible stuff especially if you athlete and you healthy hamstring so we have this week the healthy hamstring workout I to show you how to do a hamstring workout without ever doing uh a lying hamstring curl on any kind of machine uh the deceleration leg swings three times 10 each leg a three-way hamstring RDL I that physio ball Circle curls and then my assisted glute ham raise is really cool we again to do what we have to do so let me start right here with these um deceleration uh you know leg swings basically you these assisted bands again put your foot in let it come out here now stabilization you got to stabilize through this down glute so got to keep yourself uh stable here leg goes down slip bring it down right at the ankle bring it straight down to here decelerate on the way up straight down decelerate so you about a 45° angle through here here because you still want to make sure that your uh your hips are active in stabilization then it comes up nice and slow and slow on the way down if I came here I just let it pop up that I deceleration so you want to be controlling it on the way up and you see you higher and higher and you actually get a little bit of the hamstring stretch at the same time so 10 on each side then we come on over here to the three-way hamstring RDL now you can either grab two low pulley or one I now load it up and get on the whatever hand I have it in going to get on the opposite side so I let it bring me down and now I to accelerate out of that using my glute pushing through all right I pulling here at all so we straight on and drive out of it we come across our body to the outside of the foot and drive out of it then I come to the inside of the body and you that this has to counter me and then drive out of it so that and we go here around four rounds of three here in and then drive out so you got four rounds of that straight ahead in and out next thing we do right here physic ball circles get down on the ground you we want to AC if you want to protect your hamstrings you have to get the glutes to contribute because what is that most hamstring strains come from the hamstrings working when the glutes quit if your glutes were involved in doing the job that they do your hamstrings would only be doing the job that they instead of trying to do the job of both muscles so we want to be able to fire the glutes at all times when we working the hamstring so here we these curls before but what I want you to do is is really make sure that your glutes are active getting yourself elevated and from here you do curls with a circle in and out reason being here want to work all different sides of the hamstrings inner hamstring outer hamstring you toes actually turning and rotating as we go little turn to the left pull in turn out to the right each one activating different areas of the hamstring again keeping that glute you know firing to keep you in that bridge the whole time so we go about six clockwise six counterclockwise and bring ourselves through one set you know three total sets you can do it in a circuit or you can do it at straight sets last one back to the band again one of the greatest exercises you could possibly do a glute ham raise you could do it on your own just like this so you got your band up up on top anchor your your feet under something okay now you on to the band come here and you body fall and then when you come up you hamstring so this is what the work I to come back up and firing from the from the glutes down resist pull back up by squeezing the hamstrings come down get to the bottom pull back up hard on the hamstrings deceleration exceleration deceleration and then up acceleration so we take that through about you know 12 reps or so but you working on that slowly controlling that hamstrings now real quick too just to kind of finally uh drill this point home think about it if you hamstring curl you you knee let me show you something real quick if you know playing sports what bends my knee it flexing you to get down here from your hamstrings gravity is just kind of bending you if you just let let gravity take you down it knees so if you hamstring curls to do all your hamstring training you yourself up for an injury because that is not the way the hamstrings work when we in the gym it feels like that they actually making them contract that way but it playing a game or playing a sport if you want to do it the way that they it when you to work on its ability to control deceleration this is the exact way you want to do it so guys you know athl X right now you know by now um as a physical therapist you want to make I want to make a program that that is not only going to give you the results you want to build muscle to make the muscles fire the way they but now to keep you healthy because if if it wasn healthy you wouldn to go back in the gym and get results anyway it would knock you out You hurt you wouldn shape so very important to find a program that keeps you healthy gives you results helps you build muscle and at the same time because of the meal plan helps you lose weight you know that kind of the perfect combination right there so if you haven the uh the SWAT team that now just started using athl X these guys uh entrust their lives and the lives of others to athl X I couldn about it you know joining those guys head over to aex.com right now get the system put it to use for you stay healthy stay in the gym and we back here again with some more workouts [Music] thanks [Music] h h h	Success
Ankle Sprain Fix and Prevention (IMPROVES SQUAT TOO!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzy289wmsKQ	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] What athlete.com. Today we about the ankle and how it could be preventing you from having normal biomechanics through big exercises, things like the squat and the deadlift because you know, you try to get down into a squat or a deadlift and all of a sudden your heels pop off the ground or you feel pinching in the front of your ankle or you just feel tightness that doesn Those can cause problems. And we know that since this is a kinetic chain, the problems move up into the knee or up into the hip, and we don This is particularly useful if you are a chronic ankle sprainer, somebody that sprained their ankle before, or maybe you just had an ankle sprain recently. What I going to help you to actually get more movement. So, what we do is we look here at the ankle and we have to understand what we place. I felt on the back side here in your calf region. when you try to go down into a squat because if that related, we can work on that through stretching. What I that pinching feel or that tightness feel or that jamming feel that you feel in the front of your ankle. You can kind of identify it because it that moves on the fixed bones here. And it between the two bumps on the side of your ankle that you can feel. Those two big bumps are the fibula and the tibia. They call them the maloli, right? So, we know that this thing moves right in the middle of those and it has to be able to move backwards, right? It goes it kind of hides inside and behind the tibia as it moves up. And that into dorsif flexion. As we lower down, you need to be able to get dorsif flexion and keep your heel on the ground. If you sprainer, what happens is two things. Number one, you either lose the ability to have this move here in this joint. It doesn fix that in two ways like I show you. Or what happens is the fibular head because of all the sprains actually gets moved forward too much. It gets in the way. So you can see that this bone right here gets jammed forward a little bit too much. Then this is going to get in the way of this moving freely. So it could do this two different ways. Firstly, you can try to bring the tibia forward on a fixed lower joint. Okay? So, if you do what I you place the band around the back of your tibia, clearly higher up above this area here, above the ankle, 2, 3, 4 in above the ankle, and you anchor it behind, and you step away. Now, with it stepping away, the force is that it wants to pull your tibia forward. And we know that if we bring the tibia forward, that relation to it go backwards, which is exactly where we want it to go, back. So, you get into this position. The band is pulling you forward. And now you just lunge yourself down. And all you focusing on doing is driving your knee forward here like this. Driving forward to get more into dorsif flexion. And you just keep working on that. And you feel that it loosens up. Maybe do it about eight to 10 times. You step out, you get out of the band. You right away you should have more freedom of motion here to be able to go lower and still keep your heel on the ground. The other way to attack this is to go after the subtailor joint itself. So you can see now I turn around and I go the other direction. And I really want to make sure that the band is low enough on my foot. So see as I place this band, I going right here on the skeleton down here. And then I step away and I use my other foot to anchor the band kind of at this downward sloping angle. And you can see that the pull force is now going to be this way down like this. Now, when we go and we angle out and we go into our our drive our knee forward and down, you can see that we again down into a posterior glide. So, we pulling it down this way, which is again the direction we know it has to go in in order to increase that motion. Now, if all that doesn you can do is you can work on that fibrillar head. And again, as a chronic ankle sprinter, I will tell you almost 95% of the time, I find that the fibular head gets displaced a little bit too far forward. So, you do what I here. You put your ankle up onto a bench. You grab the band, you wrap it around itself, and you place it around the back of your ankle. Now, you can see here, I sure I overlap that fibular head, the bony area. And I take the band. I going to show you here first with my hands outside and then I again as I as I demonstrate it actually going. I wrapped it around. I the band really tight right here because I want to grab onto that that little bone, that little malleia on the outside. I want to grab it and then pull really hard with my right hand as I wrap around. Put them both into this left hand and then glide back. So now what I glide. I put my foot up on the bench and I lean my knee in to try to get a lot more dorsif flexion. So, see as I do it, I just told you. I I hand in this case. And I to do that like f focus all my force on the posterior glide of that fibular head. And I can guarantee you that if you do that a few times and then step out and get down onto the floor, you notice you have much more motion in that ankle joint. And especially if you have somebody that again chronic ankle sprinter who has a lot of cracking and popping in your ankle, you notice that you really get rid of a lot of that if not all of it. It temporary. You have to do it frequently throughout the week, maybe two to three times, but over time when you reposition and then strengthen in that new position, you chance of keeping it like that forever. So guys, I know this is a little technical, but I think it help you out a lot in terms of gaining more mobility so that you don your rest of your body here when you go to do those big lifts like squats and deadlifts that require you to go down low. All right, so make sure that you work on these and I guarantee you going to find more mobility, less pain, and hopefully an end to your chronic ankle spraining.

Hamstring Muscle Cramps (WEAK GLUTES!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54yBZLiQNT4	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] hey Jeff this is Chris from Arkansas I 34 and I for the last 8 to 10 months my ask Jeff question is when I try to do things like barbell hip thrusts I get Charlie Horse cramps in my hamstrings now keep in mind I do an 8 to 12 minute Dynamic one up prior to working out as well as a static stretch routine nightly thanks for all your information and keep up the great work hey Chris thanks for your question it question because cramping most often is not the result of what we think it might be you see a lot of people think that cramping comes from either being dehydrated or low in sodium or low in potassium and while those things might occur they really only occur at such severe levels of depletion that you probably going to have other things to worry about than getting to the gym and doing your workout you see when you cramp especially during a barbell hip thrust most often the result of that or what another muscle group trying to do the job of the muscle group that in the first place so think about a barbell hip uh thrust you should be getting the strength of your from your glutes to drive you into hip extension it are bent so you think that you got to push up through your hamstrings but the hamstrings are probably trying to do the job of the weak glutes and in doing so they asking for help when the help really there so the the ill equipped help or muscles here hamstrings for hip extension are not going to do a really good job doing it so they work and do their best but become quickly seized up and cramped because you overloaded so in this case you looking at Ser probably a case of weak loose so what you have to do is really start to switch your mindset when you do your glute barbell thrust or your glute exercises is really focus on trying to initiate the movement with the glutes squeeze as hard as you possibly can squeeze like you got your last dime between your cheeks it might work something whatever you can think about to try to drive that movement from the glutes first and then allow the hamstrings to help the same thing happens even when you squat you hamstrings actually help you with knee extension not curling your knee up it why I don curled machines because they functional see in function your hamstrings will actually work to extend your knee watch as I demonstrate here with the skeleton see as I take a step we know that the hamstring wants to kind of bend my knee back now remember the descent into a squat or even as we walk as our knee bends that hamstring flexion that because we allowing the knee to bend as I take that step what happens though is in order to straighten ourselves out if I would didn pull my leg back openly here you can see that the bone would move the knee would flex and that do is what we think that hamstring curl machines but if I don allow my foot to come off the ground which is what walk or run or squat then that force is getting blocked and here when I put my hand behind it what happens if I keep moving my body forward like I what happens it actually straightens the knee out you could do this yourself again try to pull back on your hamstring but don ground you straighten your knee so the role of the hamstring is is probably misunderstood and that different hamstring injuries and it really driven by the fact that the glute initiates the movement even in the bottom of the squat and even with every step we take let the glute become the PowerHouse and let the hamstring then kick in help you less cramping and again maybe you want to address your hydration needs too but I don weakness in the prim muscle is is is asking for help from other muscles that are ill equipped to help out in the first place and that of cramps I hope you guys found this helpful and if you have make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up and if you want your question answered here on my next ask jef segment send your questions right here in media relations at aex.com and I include yours there and if you looking for a complete training program to start putting the science back in strength in training you like an athlete then head to athlet x.com right now and grab one of our athletex training systems guys I again in just a couple days	Success
Elbow Pain with Pullups (QUICK FIX!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_1ylJ-9twY	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what athleanx.com does your elbow hurt right on the inside here every single time you step up to a bar to do a pull-up I think I might know what of fact I can help you determine not only how to get through a session so you can get back to doing pull-ups the right way without pain but also to maybe have a little bit more awareness of might be causing it in the first place and we can actually try to fix that now once and for all elbow pain is one of the most common sources of discomfort when we lift the problem is that the elbow I talked about before is what we call a consequential joint so it the mercy of what happens above and below so what happens at our shoulder what happens here at our wrist the elbows kind of just goes along for the ride unfortunately not having much of a saying what we do we of what what want to try to protect the elbow when we do pull-ups it that happens with any exercise we do we want to get the damn thing done so what we do is we cheat our way through reps even if we have to and you do it all the time they start getting up the first thing they they this way they up anything they can to get themselves to appear as if they body up closer to the bar and yes doing this will help us to get a little bit higher because we strength of our forearm flexors to add to the contribution of the lats so we can get there and even more than that we our pronators do you ever see guys kind of look like they up into the bar this way so they kind of like this and they trying to pull their hands down even though they twisting and pulling to see if they can get themselves up a little bit more the problem with all three of those moves the flexion of the flexion of the fingers the pronation of the wrist into the bar the flexion of the wrist itself for the forearm flexors is all these muscles attached right here to this little tiny bump on your inside of your elbow this little bony bump on the inside of your elbow that tension and force that gets generated in passed on to this little tiny bump that has to absorb all that and guess what it can when you if you first get an awareness of I can cheat I have to let myself use my shoulders first let the shoulders initiate the move pack those shoulder blades down and in remember I talked about the shoulder contributing once those are down and in now you to let yourself pull the rest of the way but don reps forward by allowing all these muscles to contribute cuz over time time it are built for the lats sure they can handle the job your little tiny forearms they can got huge forearms they still can maintain and withstand all that tension now if you already have this problem what you need to do is try this little fix that I here let you pain what you do is you come up to a bar this is one of our athl extreme bands you wrap it around the bar you put one end through itself this way so now the bar it take the two two parts of the band you overlap them so we thickness we thickness on top of the bar that important because one of those muscles I talked about that had a role in actually flexing the fingers all the way from the very end and then crossing the wrist and doing this too which is going to be one of the primary offenders when we trying to cheat our way through a rep and probably causes of aggravation to that medial elbow is something called the fdp a flexor digitorum profundus it fingers that goes all all the way deep attaches to that inside of that elbow right there and can cause some problems if we put this band and then rest our three last three fingers here so our ring our little finger ring finger middle finger on top of here and just sort of rest them and get them out of the way then we grip the bar with the the last two fingers here our forefinger and thumb the forefinger also is controlled by that same muscle but it has a separate muscle belly so it tends to sort of avoid some of the aggravation that gets uh that happens from the the last three so you get those last three out of the equation you put the uh just those other two fingers on the bar and then you do your pull-up what happens is these other ones are now going for the ride they contributing to all that force that gets directed into the inside of your elbow so now when I when I come up if I have elbow pain I find that I have far less because I all contributing with those three fingers they ride resting on top of that little lip that we created these two fingers are doing most of the work almost as a hook so give this one a try if you of that inside elbow pain and I telling you you difference and guys the thing about joint pain is you don with it you see if you train smart you can get around some of the issues that might be causing you to feel as if it something you with all the time joint pain is something that debilitates every recreational lifter at some point in their lives whether it be shoulder whether it be their knees whether it be their elbows a a matter of fact it very very common obviously in my Realm with professional athletes we created athlean RX mechanics which is our joint recovery formula for that one very reason right now it of the best teams in Major League Baseball the New York Yankees the St Louis Cardinals both first place teams guys it sure they can stay on the field and do the things they need to to cause a winning season well you guys may not be C trying to shoot for a winning season but you can set new records in the gym feel healthy get bigger be stronger you can do that if pain is getting in the way no pain equals more gains guys if you can keep yourself pain free you of the game athlet RX mechanics we have that at athl x.com in the meantime if you like these joint mechanic videos and and ways around common joint injuries just let me know as a physical therapist guys this is my job I these videos up here and help you to work around some of the things you might be dealing with let me know in the comments Below in the meantime I back here again in just a couple days with another new video see you	Success
ACL Tears (REHAB TIPS AND BEST EXERCISE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaACJok0T48	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com today we all about ACL injuries in a continuing effort to bring you guys a little bit inside of my life and what best friend here Charlie he had an ACL tear he I knee why this happens what you can do about it and most importantly what you might be able to do soon after it happens to you to help speed up your recovery like we with Charlie all right guys so my best workout lately has been carrying this guy around all 80 lbs of him because he tore his ACL I know how debilitating this injury can be especially if you there but don company CU it got this going on it popular injuries that you can possibly get orthopedic Al so learning how to deal with it especially if you watching this having dealt with this injury in the past is going to be helpful all right so Charlie going put you down for one second big boy he already falling asleep in my hands the most important thing about our knee is it single step we take if you you got a lot more than just steps you cuts and you have to be agile you have to be able to push and change direction well a lot of times the ligaments that run inside of our knee are are the only support we have against those forces that are caused by the change of Direction and unfortunately sometimes the forces are greater than the strength of our ligaments and we have issues so first of all I want to show you guys what the ACL does so you can get a better understanding of it because the thing that always amazed me was there are no mistakes when it comes to our anatomy everything is placed exactly where it should be for an exact reason because it serves a very specific function so if you want to look at your your knee and as you will with this rubber band here this is going to be the top part of your uh of your knee joint your femur and this is going to be the bottom part of your knee the tibia if you were to put a rubber band over your thumb okay and then make a fist and then from here wrap it around your index finger of your tibia when I then put them together we runs from the back side of the T of the femur okay behind our knee in the upper part of our leg and it runs and attaches across to the inside front of the tibia so what happens is we know first of all if I try to pull the uh tibia forward on the upper bone in our thigh the femur it doesn resistance there the ACL is trying to prevent that from happening it also will prevent this is one of the things that people don rotation of the knee so if the foot is planted and the leg turns out to the side right you want to change direction plant your foot and then turn to the right to push off that way you internal rotation down the knee and you can see that there band if I were to try to externally rotate my leg right there tension on the ACL so understanding the placement of the ACL in the knee will tell us everything about its function and what we need to worry about so what happens when this ligament that runs again from Back to Front tears well we don some of you guys out there can imagine we also get damage to the medoc collateral ligament that usually winds up getting torn to in a very severe ACL injury and we get damage to the meniscus that sit on top of the tibia here because once we lose that control of internal rotation we get a grinding of the two bones together that to basically grind and tear the surface and my friend Charlie he actually had a miniscus tear as well that had to be repaired so the most important thing that you can do when you have an ACL injury is to control the inflammation right now with Charlie we anything but trying to keep him limited on his walks make sure that what he does is just enough to be outside and get some weight bearing cuz we know that early weight bearing is definitely going to be useful and more uh able to accelerate your recovery than some of the older approaches that casted you and didn restricted your motion we want to get some weight bearing but you definitely going to want to make sure that you inflammation because the worst thing about inflammation is it shuts down the whole operation as soon as your body senses out uh inflammation even in the knee in cases of uh just interarticular uh fluid right we can get that from time to time water on the knee you function of the muscles around it most importantly the quadriceps once the quadricep stops to function you don really have the a good ability to straighten your knee and when you lose that you can actually start to develop scar tissue and have your knee shortened in a contractive position and if you don whole other issue in and of itself but first and foremost you got to control the inflammation so once we do that and we start to progress ourselves to work on the range of motion we able ble to get full knee extension first then start worrying about the flexion in our knee second all right Remember full knee extension first then start worrying about that you can work on full knee extension by literally pushing down on your leg trying to get it to straighten out but really what you guys watch our channel for is strength and conditioning and what are we really doing strengthwise to help with this ACL to hope hopefully make it come back stronger and faster well we want to make sure that we exercises versus open chain exercise you guys have heard me talk badly about the knee uh knee extension a lot and I feel for good reason in a case here for for the ACL there on that that the sharing Force placed on the tibia in a knee extension that we just don plus I always feel like you want to strengthen yourself in the a position that you likely got hurt in and that was likely with your feet on the ground okay 70% of the as injuries come from a non-con injury it cutting and your feet on the ground we want to be able to strengthen that knee with the foot back in the condition it was when it got hurt to try to hopefully prevent that from recurring so well I going to have you doing squats and I think the best version of a squat that you can do is going to be a front squat because if we can put that center of gravity a little bit in front of our body by bringing that weight in front of us and having a more upright stance as opposed to a back squat where we going to be sitting our hips backwards more you perceived stress by the ACL in that position which will allow you to load up quicker strengthen your quads and return to action faster with a stronger more functional leg than you might if you focusing on back squat so if you haven T your ACL I hope you never do we actually have a video on testing your intrinsic knee strength to see how well you might be fortified against a possible knee injury or ACL tear you going to want to watch that video I post it here as well so there you have it guys the ACL what it is how it functions what you have to do if you hurt yours and that you most of all it so you want to make sure you don in the first place guys if you want to look like an athlete you got to train like an athlete doing that in my book means training safely and P pushing yourself to the limits but do it in a way that allowing your body to become a bigger stronger version of yourself while also fortifying it against these types of injuries if you haven head to athletex docomo faster more Rift but at the same time let me as a physical therapist guide you so that you can become a more functionally strong version of yourself as well all right guys give TR a little bit of love he real soon in the meantime I one hell of a bicep workout holding this guy up and carrying him wherever he needs to be but he I here in just a couple days whatever you guys like to see leave it down in the comments below and I you see you guys	Success
Training With Joint & Muscle Soreness and Injuries (GOOD OR BAD IDEA?)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULh_CHEQvxk	ATHLEAN - X	no pain no gain it depends on what kind of pain you training at all with pain and injury this is one video you don [Music] miss what athleanx.com today we about the number one question we get here on this channel we see it over and over again and that if I got this hurting me or that me should I continue to train or should I step away from the gym here question that because as a physical therapist and a professional strength coach I actually get to address this and see this from both sides of the spectrum I get to see it in the acute stage when somebody actually rehabing and then see them as they attack their workouts once again and try to make sure that these pains and issues don so I feel like I can I qualified here to help you with this and it starts right here guys with what I call the cycle of pain if you to figure out whether or not you should go back into the gym or continue working out around an injury it to come down to this cycle of pain and that means when you get pain or discomfort in a lift and it could be your knees on a squat or it could be your shoulder on a bench press or it could be even your shoulder on a on a on a side lateral raise when you feel that pain the first thing that happen is you joint mechanic uh pattern so if if it that Squat and I feel pain in my knees the first thing I instinctively try to find a way to avoid the pain so the same thing on a shoulder side lateral raise I feel pain when I in this range from here to here so I instinctively try to find a way that I don my shoulder so I kind of lift lean maybe you know pull uh pull up a little bit with my trap what times these alter joint mechanics are not even perceptible in the mirror cuz they can know that they altered joint mechanics the next thing we to the squat example if I can feel too much pain when I when I squat with my knees and I try to lean a little bit more to take the the the the um descent out of the knees and put it more into the hips guess what happens the quads don taking our alter joint mechanics the quads are now doing half of the work work they for that leads to quad weakness so you an inability to reach the muscle size that you should when you start to avoid your pain alter your joint mechanics and then cause weakness and or a decrease in muscle size what goes along with the alter mechanics is also a compensation the body what it has to do it point B from point A the problem is it shifts the load often times to joints that are ill equipped to handle those loads again with the example of the squat as I try to lean more forward to take the the knees out of the equation I I put more of it onto the hips but more so I put more of it onto my low uh to my low back so the low back is ill equipped to handle the loads of a back squat as you lean forward it now you wind up with pain again and now unfortunately it that initially bothered you in your knees now it got two problems to deal with as you can see here guys this is a a deadly cycle here it say the least I get brought in a lot and you know now there CrossFit is a pro popular way to train now I have my differences in how they train but it doesn don lot of times to do seminars with Crossfit athletes about what can they do to break this cycle of pain and it doesn that way or whether you your own program if you you yourself whether or not it for you to be training if you have the opportunity to work with someone like myself who could fine tune and look and oversee your program as you and make those uh corrections as needed to allow you to continue to train through and not allow an acute injury to become a chronic injury that thing that with the with the New York Mets was my job was to help these guys those guys are constantly training with issues but we have to be able to get them to continue to get out on the field and play and get around those issues but not everybody has access to somebody like that that can actually oversee every aspect of their training I trying to put a lot more of our corrective and Mobility stuff on our Channel as well because you guys have been asking for it and we do that and you can try to start incorporating some of that stuff into your training as well and if that doesn there of the big things that I just invested a large amount of my time in was the development of our athl mechanics joint supplement guys joint recovery is just as important as Muscle Recovery in the recovery picture you guys know how big I feel recovery is when it comes to seeing gains in the gym as a natural drug-free trainer guys you have to make sure that recovery is on your top of your priority list and if you joint recovery then you yourself into big problems eventually again you and laugh at the whole topic thinking that I not at all guys I had uh early early knee issues that if I was doing something to address them back in my early 20s I probably feel a lot better these days than I did if I hadn know just abused them the way I did so it if you training with pain guys if you if you need to take it to that next level NSAIDs are not the answer long long recurrent use of NSAIDs has its own host of issues that you can look up online if you need to see them so you kind of got to look more of a natural way again if you haven definitely encourage you check out athl mechanics we coming up with a natural way to help to break this cycle of pain because if we can interrupt this pain then we can normalize your mechanics we to alter them we normalize joint mechanics now in that same squat we get down we do the squat effectively the way it putting the focus back on the quads now your quads start to grow a lot more they start to get a lot stronger so we looking at weakness we strength there is no compensation compensation was actually directed to the joints that were supposed to do the job in the first place there to throw the forces other places that can you can start to get rid of the pain and work in a natural way and we can actually start to execute the exercises the way they that guys get get the point there are things you can try to do if you those things are not working for you then it other ways if you supplemental way I would totally guys point you in the direction of athlete mechanics I really think this is going to be a game Cher for a lot of people who find themselves in discomfort at all when they train whether it be through CrossFit whether it be whatever Training Method you to

Muscle Cramps Working Out (WHAT REALLY CAUSES THEM!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da3SvJ5elOE	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] hey Jeff this is Chris from Arkansas I 34 and I for the last 8 to 10 months my ex Jeff question is what between a cramp and a contraction During certain moves like Cable Crossovers I get a bad cramp here under my armpit when I do things like bicep curls I get a big cramp right here at the front of my arm and when I try to do things like barbell hip thrusts I get Charlie Horse cramps in my hamstrings now keep in mind I do an 8 to 12 minute Dynamic warm-up prior to working out as well as a static stretch routine nightly thanks for all your information and keep up the great work thanks Chris it good question you see when people tighten up or cramp up during an exercise the first thing they think is going on is that they they out so if you you even the way I showed you a couple weeks ago they they problem a lot of times is that the cramping is really a substitution for stability where you so if you think about it this way if you get cramping in your bicep it might be that your actual your bicep isn to handle the load that you subjecting it to so it cramps to provide stability to the Joint to the Elbow so that you can actually get through the movement without damaging it but a cramp isn because a cramp will hurt as you well know so what we want to do is we want to try to strengthen the muscles that are cramping more and we do this not in a contracted position so if you to strengthen the bicep you would not do it in an exercise that places Peak Contra you know Peak tension at Peak contraction so like with a a spider curl where I peak contraction and Peak tension at the same point that to a lot of cramping the same thing happens with a bridge as you describe bridging up in in at Peak contraction of the glutes and maybe into the hamstrings you for the bicep you try to get an exercise that places Peak contraction or Peak tension in the middle of the the strength curve so for a barbell curl we get it somewhere around here but as I get to the very top where I contracted I actually don tension there so you try to increase your strength and all the exercises that don in the peak contraction State once you do that you build up your strength in those exercises you go back to doing the exercises that were causing the problem and you should have no problems anymore at least you should find it to be dramatically reduced of course make sure you because a muscle can easily cramp at a lot higher rate and frequency when when it dehydrated State okay so I hope you found this uh helpful and remember guys if you want your ask jef question answered here all you got to do is make sure you send me one record a video of you asking the question that on your mind and I will do my best to answer it here in a future a jef segment in the meantime guys if you found this video helpful make sure you leave a comment and a thumbs up below and uh I see you	Success
ACL Tear - Testing Your Knee BEFORE it Happens!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImJrixk2DCU	ATHLEAN - X	ACL injuries are on the rise in the NFL but today I maybe checking your depth and how well you are holding it can be the key to preventing a lot of these [Music] injuries what aex.com I said it in the open here ACL injuries on the rise now even if you aren reason why you need to know about this because I you can determine whether you are susceptible to getting an ACL injury so we can not only prevent it but even if you how you can translate what I show you here to the gym to expose any weaknesses and most of all as we always try to do here at affle next correct them so that you can become a much bigger stronger better version of you so I right now with ACL injuries on the rise this year particularly we need to have ways that we can take an athlete or non-athlete and screen to see if there are any deficiencies that might be causing this what do I like to do this little wall test seated wall test why because it very very easy and simple to administer and it only takes seconds we all know of a seated wall squat okay come down here up against the wall parallel to the ground head up shoulders back hands off your thighs if you can because you don want to be pushing into here you that makes it much EAS easier and you go you try to maintain your position here you fatigue of the hamstrings and you want to see how long it takes you to fatigue now what is the point when you have that seated squat position in order to resist my knees flexing too much and coming down and just giving in I need to extend the knee and we know that the quad can extend the knee so if I I sure that it and also we order to prevent this hip flexion from going on this deep hip flexion what we want is hip extension okay back that way in essence you that because we wall but that hip extension is going to impact the glutes and hamstrings so when we here we co-contraction of the quads hamstrings and glut all at the same time what does that mean co- contraction around the joint will stabilize a joint so if we have trouble here stabilizing the knee joint and you start to see them do this or kind of Veer out or whatever right if you get this adduction of the hip or valgus at the knee then you don contraction abilities around that joint and you could see that play out on the field especially as you start to do something a little bit um spur the moment right not predictable like you would in a weight room so what are the numbers you situation when you feet like I just demonstrated the average for college football players is 75 or 79 seconds at 60 seconds or less if you can to put yourself at a much more increased risk of injury the next thing you could do is a crossover where you come down cross one foot over the other and sit here like that again hands off head back for this version you 60-second average time and a 45 second um fatigue where if you couldn for that long you second guess whether or not you stable enough in your knee and and again with the focus on usually the HCL being the thing that goes when you last one very cool that you want to try not all that sexy in the way it looks but very revealing is going to be a one-legged version we down so this was one-legged before but we had stability through the other leg resting on top now it up in the air one leg down the test here 30 seconds if you could hold it for 30 seconds you want to test both legs obviously you at least in one area your co- contraction ability is pretty good okay so be just right down here and leg up I can tell you right away this is real way harder I can feel my glute I can feel my hamstring I can feel my quads I going on here which is good but you might see this start happening when you do it okay now I can do this I before on both sides and it is one of the first things I test with my athletes to make sure that they have that ability but go ahead and try it and see what is your stability and remember even if you intend to step on a field of competition having the ability to have your muscles around a joint work the way they supposed to fire together the way they injury free but it also allows you to lift heavier lift more be more efficient in the weight room and see overall better results guys that is all about training you like an athlete if you haven to see what it everything working together the way it should then head over to athletex decom and start training like an athlete today get the athletex training system guys I days with another workout in the meantime start telling me some of your numbers of what you test out on here be very interested to know and if you are a football player or just any kind of an athlete tell me what kind of an athlete you are as well as your time we can start to see what some of your scores are all right guys I just a few [Music] [Music] days	Success
Working Out after Hernia Surgery (AX JEFF!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNdctm7js0M	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] Hey Jeff, how are you? Hey again, thanks for everything you do for us. A question for you. Um, just went in for X-ray yesterday. Potential inguinal hernia. I in and uh have surgery. wonder if you or any of your subscribers have had uh experience with it and uh what I am going to be looking forward to over the next four to six weeks. Everything I read looks like it uncomfortable. So, uh I forward to it, but it is the only way to um repair these things. So, uh any help on that would be great. My name is Doug Goldstein out here in El Dorado Hills, California, and this is my axe Jeff question. Thanks. Hey Doug, thanks for your ask Jeff question. So, when it comes to hernas, I expert here on staff of Athletics X because I unfortunately I And yes, you should get them repaired. A lot of people will wait a long period of time. I know people have waited years to get theirs done. My first one, I waited about 3 or 4 years. But progressively the pain gets more and more and you run the risk of causing more and more complications, serious complications that will not only become a lot more life-threatening, believe it or not, but they going to take you to recover from your your hernia surgery. So, if you go in there electively, as it seems like you are now, that what you it some pain. you getting an abdominal surgery. So, you going to have some pain and discomfort in that area, but because of the way they do this, if you mesh surgery that they do laparoscopically, all they basically placing a mesh on the inside of your abdominal cavity that pushes out and covers the hole. If you were to bear down or try to do some sort of even an ab exercise itself, all you pushing the mesh further in place with the interabdominal pressure that you generating. So, you running the risk of damaging the repair. So, it the only thing I is pain or discomfort. The old way they used to do is they used to put it on the outside so that if you did push any further, the sutures that were holding the mesh in place did run the risk of actually breaking and you damaging the repair. So, what did I do 2 to 3 days after I was done with my uh surgery? I was down on the ground doing very, very basic limited core movements. I knew that if I can get my core active just trying to re-engage and get things woken up down there that I chance of speeding up my recovery. And I firmly believe that I did. I will say though, anything hanging like a pull-up or forget any type of hanging ab exercises that took me the longest because we know that as soon as you hold the bar, you better have really good core strength to be able to hold yourself steady. That was just misery for me. So, it took me probably about four to five weeks before I can even somewhat hang on a bar and before I can start cranking out pull-ups again. probably about 6 to 7 weeks, but there no stopping you if you can get in there, do this thing electively, and start doing some of these more conservative ab exercises after you thanks for the question, guys. Remember, this is now a new feature that we have here on this channel. Ask me your question, and I your answer if it right, I few days.	Success
How To Fix Muscle Asymmetry - Quick Dumbbell Tip	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAUCnqzLBt8	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] hey guys jeff cavaliere from athleanx.com this week what we to do is actually have a little bit of a departure and go to a tip you guys run it a lot of times and say how do I equalize left and right side muscle imbalances you know whether it be of strength and balance whether it be of size and balance because that is common I mean if you are dominantly right-handed or left-handed it is common to have you know bigger muscles on that side from your finger you know from your wrist and forearm all the way up to your shoulders but not so not just in the development but also in the strength and the best tip I could probably give you is to actually work out with dumbbells that are unequal in weight now what I got here is as some of you guys joke all these things toasters well they actually aren blocks but basically we have 20 pounds in my right arm I got 30 pounds my left arm now let arm is the one that basically as I lift up with these I gonna do a regular curl this one the tendency to want to accelerate cuz it be a little bit harder because it probably more of my actual strength level the thing is is that in order to move these things so note that the tip is to actually move these things at equal speed so we together which forces me to kind of concentrate over here more and slow this thing you know slow it down the tendency guests don up a little too fast this won behind we same speed so I here and then I so combining that with another major principle of athlean-x is the time under tension actually slowing down your repetitions if you just be a rescue swimmer and you just drop some you not really working so much the tension on the muscle more so you momentum and that that and get lean so combine really two principles in athlean-x you are now going to have to use unweighted weights and then move them at the same speed now I can easily use that for another exercise as well we could do shoulder presses so again 20 over here this one want to fly up this one probably cause a little bit more trouble for me to get it up but we move them together so that my muscle link between moving this week and actually getting the muscle to fire in this case the shoulder is trying to get the shoulder to fire we are now forcing our body and our minds to kind of concentrate on what we and that in and of itself is going to equalize development you start to activate muscles so that you don right now by forcing yourself to concentrate and slow it down now obviously don side you can have to switch it up go to the other side reading the thirty pounds okay and the 20 on the other side and the same thing now guys this is not about sitting I have a weak arm and I got to use 20 or 30 pounds or make it different it weights that forces your mind to concentrate so if you haven guys if you want some unique training if you want exercises that force your muscles to grow in unique ways then start the athlean-x program we built in to the program lots of unique stuff like this trying to educate you guys on how to actually build muscle and not just you know rolling the dice and hoping it works you know you might as well get the most out of the time that you spend in the gym that to athleanx.com right now grab the athlean-x training system working all these kind of principles right into the program already and guys in the next 90 days get the best results that you possibly can I I promised a band video I really really really unique use of the Bands coming up next week I you soon [Music]	Success
Triceps Size ÂSecretÂ (GET BIGGER ARMS!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg3YobPozhU	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com with a little help of a muscle marker and just a little bit of math we real secret to size of the triceps so let if the triceps are being said to be two-thirds on the sides of the arm I will tell you this the long head of the triceps is about two-thirds the size of the triceps so even Jessi has approved this math I think it two-thirds is 4/9 almost half are the size of your arm is going to be responsible to the development of the long head of the triceps so we break out the muscle marker to help you to understand where that actually is you can see it damn expansive here it covers a large portion of the triceps so we to thicken up the arms you need to be focused on that long head but you need to know how to do it right and here the unique part about the long head of the triceps unlike the other two portions of the triceps the lateral head in the medial head it has an attachment that goes beyond just the arm itself so the lateral medial head start and finished right here on the upper arm and across the elbow joint to allow it to extend the arm but the long head also goes back in the other direction in crosses the shoulder joint and wraps around up on to the scapula so what does that mean it enables you the opportunity to hit it in two different ways the first is getting a better strength of contraction by stretching it through a series of exercises and the other is by yes dropping the load a little bit more to lighter weights but still experiencing a complete tricep contraction by getting extension of the arm behind the body as the long head of the triceps allow so let two ends of the spectrum first of all the exercises that will put you into a greater stretch the first one we looking at here is the rope push away now this exercise is again allowing our arm to start the exercise up in this elongated position we know that we stretching that long head of the triceps because if you look here quickly on me that long had the triceps if it starts over here on the scapula and it ends down here past the elbow if I can take these two points further away from each other like this like this like this like this I long head so now you can see that as exactly the position I start this exercise in so from here as I work that I to get a stronger contraction out of that long head of the triceps of course extending the elbow at the same time but now favoring that as well and we could take that even further because we can go to another exercise here the plate extension now I trying to do this exercise with dumbbells or with a single dumbbell because what happens is you have to really really internally rotate your arms in order to hold that dumbbell way back behind your head but you can do it with a plate like I as you can see instantly the difference in elbow position is I allowed to have my elbows drift a little bit more in front of my body still not compromising the stretched position because we still have that arm elevated up overhead so we head stretch without necessarily compromising your shoulder that we here with a dumbbell lying tricep extension probably my favorite way to really target the long head and we can do that by allowing our arms to get drift back behind our body obviously they standing doesn elevated in relation to my torso they are but we allow ourselves to keep the tension on the triceps by not coming straight up to vertical and that something I cover before an entire video you want to make sure the arm stays back as you go back down into each and every rep finishing into a point where you still under tension and then finally we wrap up with a bodyweight exercise which is the bodyweight tricep extension and the key here is once again just look at the position of the arm in relation to my torso even though I reclined prone position here I getting that stretch on the tricep I getting that overhead position here which is going to preferentially allow that long head of the triceps to do some extra work okay now here a lot of people get it wrong they stop their attack on the long head there but you function of the long head and that is because of the attachment as we talked about before it ability to actually pull the arm into extension because it scapula because it elbow joint it pulls back and it keeps the arm back into extension so if you are not exploring exercises that allow you to get into this position in the full contracted position of the exercise that you function of the triceps now here caveat in this position you are not going to be able to lift a lot of weights because of a concept called active insufficiency meaning when the joint is it is fully shortened range across all joints so the shoulder and the elbow now I be able to generate a lot of tension but that does not mean that I cannot fully reach a complete contraction and that where you want to focus your efforts you have to hit both sides of the spectrum so the first group of exercises gets the heavier loads you lift a little heavier weights there to make sure that you can taking advantage of the stretch reflex and the more powerful contraction but here you want to focus on getting a complete traffic contraction so we look really right away to the tricep kickback again a much overlooked exercise but one that truly truly hits the long head and it well and you can see here as I bring it up the arm is back behind the body every single time I want to let the arm drift down back in front of my body now if I really hit the long head and I can carry that over now into a bench dip and on the bench dip here your first thing is you do not grip with your hands forward here facing forward you want to rotate them out because I told you how gripping them with the hands forward fingers forward position will only internally rotate your shoulders and turn this into a shoulders shredder it doesn see I get an open chest and rotate my shoulders out and now I benefit of having the upper arm back behind my body to allow for that complete contraction of the triceps next up is another bodyweight exercise this is the Cobra push-up and look at the similarity Here I am allowing myself to get that arm into as close to an extended position as I can back behind my body I can even rock my body a little bit forward or slide forward as I do each rep to assist in getting that arm back behind the body on every single contraction all these things from the beginning exercises to these involve a straightened out elbow that is the main function of the triceps that is why the medial and the lateral head are always going to be working here you turning them off in any of these exercises they we we some extra work to that long head because the anatomy is allowing us to do that and then finally we have an exercise here that I love it the rowing tricep pushdown so with the wrong tricep pushdown I allow myself to get into that extended position as much as I can by rowing the elbows back first and then driving back down into extension and this is a tough exercise because essentially we challenged your arms are gonna want to be pulled forward because all the momentum of the row and the weight stack is pulling you that way you have to resist that drive your arms back and down extend the elbows while maintaining that extended position and you can see just how much work is being done here and for those that ever doubt the synergy of muscles that all like to work together the back is working here as well as you can see to make sure all this goes down the right way so guys if you want to start getting more size in your triceps you have that opportunity you have to stop overlooking that one third of the triceps and realize that it of the size of that triceps and overall again as Jesse said 4/9 I that math by the way that is going to be responsible for the size of your arm increasing so guys putting the science back in strength here to help you out if you that make sure you subscribe to this channel if you want a complete program that does it for

The Triceps Workout ÂMaster TipÂ (EVERY EXERCISE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PsCMjseTZA	ATHLEAN - X	Jeff it it muscle markers then make it really really easy to understand I this I just from filming the videos okay so now the obliques they come they run all the way down no no no no cut cut cut no bad you have the Linea Alba that runs down here and then it divides it into all these quadrants right now the lower abs would be right here okay the upper abs would be up in this area and sometimes you can get a hernia right in the middle right so so now the ocularis muscle that runs right here I don no no no not necessary but their muscles too man so now the supraspinatus is a really important muscle Jesse I can just draw that in that really is important now for the health of your shoulder now the thing is well it may not be a big muscle it really is important to keeping the stability here you can see the stability of that muscle so you want to make sure what jeff cavaliere athleanx.com I got some artwork on my back today and it actually a muscle but don back it Jesse you the end of this video but today I actually want to share with you something even better and it master tip this time we to the triceps if you follow along with any of our master tip series you understand that I that applies to every single tricep exercise you do it does not require any extra equipment and it can do instantly and feel the difference when we difference look at the difference here on just this dip now it is very subtle but I promise you subtle things can actually have huge differences in terms of not just how it feels to you but it more importantly to the results you see from doing the exercise and here we talking about a matter of at about an inch can you see the difference between these two dips here guys when you do your tricep exercises we need to start exploring full extension at the elbow and you might think that you elbow because your arm is getting relatively straight but I about full extension providing they have any kind blockage or chips in your elbow that prevent that so it starts though with a little bit of anatomy because obviously broke out the muscle marker we have to look at what long head of the tricep okay the long head of the tricep attaches unlike the other two heads of the triceps attaches actually to our scapula to our back and you can see that over here that it attaching way up here and because of that in order to fully contract that muscle your arm has to get back behind your body well if we full extension of the elbow that makes it even more difficult and challenging to get actually behind your body now I realize that not every arm exercise and tricep exercise requires that your arm gets back there but more on that in a second the second thing is you probably been told something really important that is don your joints cuz locking out is a bad thing guys that not true what you want to do is our bodies were built to lock out this elbow joint to go to full extension is meant to be in full extension it dangerous thing to be in full extension the problem is when we add velocity to that so you don to that because that starts to get this pounding into extension but guess what you don to your hinge joints and the hinge joints being here in your elbow and down at your knee you want to have a control of contraction but because we that you don usually kind of cut that short and that it and it get more from all these exercises if we take a tricep pushdown right here what we making sure that we don full extension but because we have the opportunity to get the arms a little bit back behind our body we can get an Enhanced contraction of the long head of the tricep for the reasons I just told you so you want to do that if you doing a dip like we covered here before you have the opportunity by the placement of your upper body to shift it forward a little bit get more upright so you do take advantage of the fact that the arm can get back behind the body but once again it extend through that final one-inch that final one-inch matters it will make a difference when you accumulate rep after rep after rep of every single tricep exercise you do I promise you you can go here to a tricep extension and the same thing when is a great tricep exercise it stretches the long head and then we go when we reach full extension again full extension those extra couple inches in this case matter a lot and then even if you have an exercise like the close grip bench press that doesn to get your arm behind your body at full extension you still want those extra few inches of full extension so don here consciously push forward now here one other thing you can do to make sure that you get to full extension or where you think it back off just a little bit I you here on the tricep pushdown again back off just one inch and then re-establish the contraction again you further than you even did the last time if you did short the extension if you were able to get full extension the first time then you re-established in that again and your time under tension in this position will be elongated but the fact of the matter is this guys you want to make sure that you are not short changing your reps especially when it comes here and the same thing is going to apply when it comes to your other hinge joint down at your legs but we could talk about that in another video and the meantime guys have found this video helpful make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below if you programs that put the science back in strength that them the muscle marker is a key component of what we do here right you want to head over to athleanx.com and do that in the meantime I video over to Jesse because he earned his right to be on this camera after what he did with his artwork on my shoulder I got to see you again soon go ahead Jesse yeah punishment for drawing the dick not a good idea go check out the

Weightlifting Belts | Weak Abs (UH-OH!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBgv30fkD7c	ATHLEAN - X	what it talking weight belts and I about how this weight belt might be making your weight belt weaker you see you actually have a weight belt that never cost you a penny and you carry it around with you all the time it transverse abdominus but by relying on this far too often you to weaken that and have it cost you at the moment that it matters the most on your big lifts when you would actually reach for this one you see the transverse abdominus is a muscle that lays right here under the rib cage and it wraps all the way around our body and through the magic of the muscle marker we can actually see what it looks like it actually comes right here all the way around and as you can see the orientation of the fibers is such that it lays just like a w belt would and it actually functions the same way it doesn what it does is it actually takes our body and it cinches it in so it does this it does the same thing that a weight belt would do as you pull it tighter it our abdomen in tighter which will provide this circular stability of the spine and core so if we train that muscle you want to learn how to actually contract it so that it actually flattens the belly down okay so what it does is it takes this belly from being out here and it learns to flatten it down provide stability that again wraps all the way around I teach you how to do this through a lot of our lower ab exercises and M matter of fact most of our ab exercises in this video that I covered over here you to watch that and see how we do that specifically but the importance of this video is to get you understanding the fact that the more of this that you use the more you completely counteracting what you actually trying to accomplish in the first place and that is stability if you wear a weight belt the first thing that happens is if you wear it appropriately you bit of extra room in here you never want to pull it all the way tight like this cuz you actually don room to push out against this with this intraabdominal pressure so you have it a little bit bit loose so that now you can push into it and then have that pressure against the pad which is pushing back in the opposite directions giving you that extra torque in spinal stability if you do that think about what you doing you with a distended belly you yourself this way to push out as you stabilize when in actuality the healthier more protected spine has the ability to Bear down and still have that intraabdominal pressure but with a flatter belly because you have the contraction the transverse abdominus so that to rely on the weight belt but the second one is overuse of this is just going to make inactivity of the transverse abdominis and it result in a weaker transverse abdominis so you couldn it so I weight belt here would say it with a history of back pain whether you had surgeries lumbar Fusion disectomy uh significant back injuries that have laid you up for a significant period of time then I would say it as you get yourself back into training from that injury but only if you agree that you directly and increase the strength of your transverse abdominus like I showed you in that video that I linked over there with the focus of building that up over time so you can wean yourself off of this use this as a as a crutch to get you back in the game again on the other end of spectrum if you powerlifter there that we again covered on the Instagram profile that will allow you to generate even just a little bit more force in your lift that will increase your lift total by even a small amount that could mean the difference between first place and third place or setting a new PR in those cases you can train there but not a lot of the guys that are watching this channel are competitively powerlifting at that degree a lot of them are watching to to just get either bigger stronger faster more athletic and again athletic you these out with you on the on the playing field or at least not comfortably so we don reliant on this I want to train you like an athlete to rely on the one that you have with you all the time so guys I hope you found this video helpful hopefully for those that are over reliant on their weight belts it wakeup call in the meantime if you looking for a program that will train you like an athlete and make you rely on the muscles that you have so you become more functionally strong and capable of performing at a moment you have everything that you have with you all the time and you use it that athletex training system if you want to see anything else covered here in a washboard Wednesday you make sure you leave it in the comments below I my best to bring those to you in the weeks ahead all right guys I again real soon	Success
Best Back Workout Video Ever (HIT EVERY MUSCLE!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXvQe9payHw	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what today we back training workout video for you and this is why cuz I damn markers for you guys a matter of fact it to make sure the Jeff muscle markers that you get what we when it comes to back training look first and foremost people don back the respect it deserves because they can train it those that are training a little bit more seriously of course you see by the time this video is done there than just the lats as a matter of fact you can see I got a whole damn road map going on back here and a lot of ink was used to make sure that we get you to understand that so I down muscle by muscle and tell you why you need to do certain things and what of the best exercises to Target those areas so you have a better understanding the next time you attack your back workout okay let that least training right so what we want to do is look at the anatomy of the lats and we they feed into the X in our back not just me I X implanted in my back it something we all should strive for and what that is is the lat as it feeds down and in you goes like this in your back it thco lumbar fascia that the lats will feed into we in in a second it feeds into it there and then they fan up and around so how would you train these well you want to make sure that you down into your sides and we do that with exercises like pull-ups or as I but why is it that you might feel it more or at least more of a stretch when you as I anatomy again if I have my arms in front of my body like this instantly you see that I of a lengthening here of the lat as it reaches all the way around the back and up around here at the top whereas if I put my arm to the side here I taken away all that extra stretch so you might feel it more by doing an underhand version of this both of them are going to ultimately end down and at your side a peak contraction of the lats but you understanding now why one might feel better than the other the next muscle group we takes a huge portion it covers a large area of your back are your traps and we look at them they they this space they literally start at the base of your head on the bump here at the back of your head they come all the way down your spine they fan out out here they come back in and they actually have different purposes and different functions depending upon the area of that muscle we might have heard people talk about the upper traps and you have people talking about the lower traps well again look at the direction of the fibers the fibers of the upper trap are coming down this way so I always talk about one of the big flaws people make when they train their traps is to strictly just lift straight up and down that training the lats the way that they actually have to be trained if you taking into resp expect the orientation of the fibers going down this way then you want to actually be pulling up and at an angle so I the exercise here that I showed you in a previous trap video that actually does just that now you don band to do this you could use a lower cable weighted heavy and you can pull at an angle up against that slope and then twist and turn because we get some of that retraction of the scapula as well so we the major functions of the upper trap the next thing we look at the lower trap and these uh fibers are going to run up in this direction so what they do is they actually stabilize down and back and hold your sh shoulder blades in place down and back so we can actually attack them with an exercise like the inverted y you take a light set of dumbbells and again if you these muscles you get used to it because you need to train all of them in order to get your back to show the way it to get your arms up and over your head keeping your shoulder blades down and back especially as you raise the weight up it gets more challenging your shoulder blades want to Fly Away keep them packed down and back and you both the upper and out of the lower traps next we have another one of those muscles that you probably don think about that much but if you want to have a complete back and a total back development you better start it Terry and proximity here to the lats and guess why because it has a lot of the same function as the lats but there differentiator that you can do to Target this a little bit more effectively it going to be the width of the grip on a laat pull down so you saw me do the lap pull down before I you again here you can see my grip here and the width of it is sort of neutral about shoulder width apart if you want to start targeting and favoring a little bit more of the terra you about as far as the bar will go perform the exercise the same way but you can see that you you can actually see that muscle Contracting right here underneath that drawing I had obviously it moves underneath the pen but the idea is you can see that area now Contracting a lot more that for you to start building this area and filling in maybe that divot that you have in the back from ignoring it for so long next we three muscles at once and people don even know that they muscles a lot of times it cuff and we about the supanan the infraspinous and the teres minor again muscles that you never even think about training when it comes to back when you lats lats lats but again they important because they actually fill in again this space up here on your upper back above and below the spine of your scapula that supraspinatus and the infraspinatus above and below now obviously the Rotator cff is a very vulnerable group of muscles that become injured often and people that don of us but we can tell that we if we give it some attention it actually can respond really well and also complete that upperback development here do it you got to externally rotate your arm if you are not externally rotating your arm in some exercise then guess what you are not training these muscles there they do for the most part is externally rotate so they take your arm and they move it outwards in the socket so what we can do is we can take an exercise like a w raise and all these exercises are ones that we actually program in athlean X because I know how important they are and how you need to make sure that you is one of them you bend over like you going to do a re a rear delt raise but from here we the arms backwards I to as you see me here move my thumbs back behind my body I this I rotating here at the shoulder so that I boid activation which we talk about next and also the external rotation some hitting all three of those muscles at once so I mentioned the romboid let again if I look at this side of my body here you because they traps so the traps are going to cover it all but if you look at this side of my body over here you can see that the rhomboids are right up in here now the idea is they run up a at a little bit of an angle so when you void exercises like a te right all we trying to do is pull our shoulder blades closer together they attach on the shoulder blade to the spine so when they shorten all they the shoulder blade from around the body back closer to the spine but because of the angle that they run when we do our te an angle you hit them even better again these are exercises that you have to do rowing will actually work these muscles too but the idea is you have to at least attack them a little bit more directly sometimes with lighter weights to get more activation and better overall development and finally we low back and again we about some of the top muscles and some of the ones that are underneath but the ones we all talk about are is the Christmas tree action right we looking at all the fibers that run this direction here and we want to know how we do that well really the most important thing especially for the safety of your low back are the muscles that run up and down they acting like guide wires that are actually strengthening and stabilizing your spine well we can do that with something as simple as a hyperextension right if the if the fibers are going straight up and down you could do what I to go from a flex position to an extended position or to a neutral position and strengthen the muscles that way but there could do even a little bit better I talked about before how the thoracal lumbar fascia has the lats that feed into it so if they feeding right into it as you can see down at the bottom there then obviously they can get the lats to be activated as well so we can do that we can combine the two if you get into this band as I show you now you band wants to pull me in this direction now if I have to resist backwards and pull against the band I spinal Erectors great but at the same time I can pull my hands out inside the band and also now Engage The lats it going to give you the opportunity to start getting that low back not just stronger but to stand out and look a lot better all right now you might be asking Jeff is there one exercise you usually good at coming up with exercises one that I can do that every every muscle in my back well unfortunately not every single one CU there there as you see but there is one move here that will combine a lot of these things together and that is you get yourself on a hyperextension again and you allow your body to fold over in the starting position so you perpendicular to the ground if I holding a pair of heavy dumbbells down here at the ground and I lift them straight up I the frontal plane as I would be with a lat pull down but I inverted lat pull down I lats I getting those muscles to to fire up but I is I then return the weights back down I come up into a normal hyperextension I working now all those muscles of the low back that we talked about all those deeper muscles I now at this point hold at the top and then I do a row and I pull the dumbbells up you know close to my sides and I try to retract those shoulder blades together so now we working on some of those midscapular muscles I all that great a job at getting the lower traps I all that greater job of getting the upper traps we are trying to retract and hold but we can do things maybe a little bit better for that but you get the idea a lot of things are working at once here so if you only have a very short amount of time this might be the one quick option that you want to try to do so there you have it guys breaking out the muscle markers to help you to understand not just how important it is to train your back but really how many ways you have to train your back if you want to get the most out of it if you guys are looking to put the science back in strength I hope these things make it a lot easier for you to visualize but I do do this every single time we do a workout in our athletex training system I try to break down the science and put it back in strength so that you understand not just what to do but why you guarantee the results come a lot faster you can find our athletex program over at aex.com in the meantime if you found this video helpful if you want more muscle markers of course I might even break out six or two packs next time depending upon what we cover make sure you leave your comments below and I will do my best in the meantime I will see you back here in just a couple days to cover more of what you want

Lower Pec Punishing Exercise (NO MORE SAGGY CHEST!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opctf0dkpVw	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what the marker is coming out today so I can show you how to understand better the anatomy of the chest so you can start getting better results in specific areas of the chest or at least trying to influence different areas of your chest because there are different areas of your chest right we know that the pec muscle is divided into different heads there comes to the lower pecs people a lot of times either ignore or don realize that there is a head really down low it the of the the PEC major and there is a way to influence its P so that you can get a little bit more favorable activation there the PEC is going to contract all our nnb we know that but we can get different activation based on the angle of pull so now when we look at the PEC if I just pull out the uh the cable here in front of me you can see right away that there is a line see if I can get this human anatomy chart working here there divide the basic you sternal portion of the PEC right all these fibers are coming from my arm and attaching right here into my sternum I this so we have the line that comes up here and that pretty much makes all the sternal fibers come this way and then above that line if I start to bring my arm up you can see that here on my clavicle all these fibers that are coming down off of that feed into the PEC this way down kind of coming an angle swooping down into my upper arm okay so you can see that now when I come all the way out here right there you see that little line dividing right to here below that is the abdominal head so this little band that comes from here up and around to here okay it band and it inserts right here here into the top of the abdominal muscles and around here to the side of the obliques into this uh area here that they call it in aerosis so right into this area here so understanding that you can actually determine how to get more uh of an activation upper or mid or even in this case lower so we know that if we want to go upper we do something called I call it a ucv raise but you want to actually be doing your crossovers or your your uh your pushing up and across from down below and across cuz we lifting up here if the angle goes from here to here in order to contract this you would pull at that angle you would do this okay that think about if you want to sort of Target the upper pecs so that angle of pull that for lower chest from the middle of the chest we across okay that direction again trying to put the fibers in line here from the lower portion to get a more favorable contraction from the bottom you can doing what people try to normally do which is these these lower cable crosses that have to go the other way you got to go up tall here so that now when I grab Mo myself a little bit more weight when I grab here we from this direction from here right they here so we want to get our humorous from here to here okay we want to follow that so we now here to get a better stretch you should try to externally rotate your shoulders so that you set your shoulder back okay if you already bringing this attachment across so you what you want to do is externally rotate your shoulder by getting your hand underhand this way now don anything else worry about your elbow because your elbow is obviously going to be attached here to your humor your humorus which is where the pecs attach so if I can kind of focus on where my elbow on what to hit this area I come underand this way and as I come down I from here to here trying to get it to touch the bottom here of my or right to the upper abs so up here High down here to low here high you can see the muscles working here down low here down low that to start targeting or at least influencing a little bit the lower portion of the abdominal head of the PEC major all right so again underhand this way up tall EXT rotate your shoulder by having your arm up underneath this way and then here and of pull here to here elbow from up top down below across your body trying to finish down at that area so guys as I said sometimes if I have to break out the marker to make you understand I absolutely will the key is to get you to understand and the key is to get you better results athletex is about putting the science back in strength to allow you guys to get better results from all your workouts if you looking for a complete program to get the maximum out of what you have to maximize your capabilities and the capacity you have to build a bigger stronger body quickly then head to athlet next.com and get our athletex training system in the meantime if you found this video helpful make sure you let me know below and uh if you want me to keep breaking out the markers I that as long as I can reach wherever the hell it is that I have to reach all right guys I	Success
How to Stretch Your Pecs (AND HOW NOT TO!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV7l1sfEmO0	ATHLEAN - X	PEC major PEC minor most serious problems if you let these things get tight i stretch each one the best way what guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com today we the PEC major neither of which are unimportant especially if you want to maintain healthy shoulders in the gym you see these two muscles are going to wreak havoc on your upper body in your shoulders particularly if you don stretch them enough or more importantly you don I make sure that you do by the end of this video we draw all over my damn body and I to show you the stretches and exactly how you have to do them to get the most out of this okay so let Raymond here and look at the function of the PEC major right we know that there two portions on the PEC major there the sternal portion which is right here off of the sternum and if they come out here and they fan out to a place up here on our upper arm bone the humerus right about mid sternum so right here is where they a clavicular portion that comes down and attaches to the same thing so you can see that if these muscles were to pull they chest so now like I said I over my damn body don want guys I I hope these things do come out though if we take our muscles here and we look at them they they I told you about and from the clavicle they the point I told you about so when I contract you can see the muscles underlying this that doing they body well now we got to go across remember the functions of these muscles now you can see that if this were to get tight and addition to being able to pull this across it will also rotate this arm bone in right if it and it gets tight shortens it pull this in that way so that we get tight we have internally rotated shoulders like this internal rotation of our shoulders brings the whole shoulder forward now we move on to the PEC minor the PEC minor is actually much more important because we never address this muscle and this has I think far more deep reaching implications to our shoulder when we don looking where the PEC minor goes it goes from the third fourth and fifth rib right here to the coracoid process right here now the most important part of that is the attachment because the coracoid process of I Spit this guy around you can see it it blades it blade so what happens when this muscles pipe and they go from here to here and they so now we get an anterior tilt of the scapula so it down and in we rotation of the shoulder blade which is down this way okay down that way and then we so the shoulder blades going to come around our body this way and we won able to retract it so again look here now I got my PEC minor so I coming down from inside here coracoid process down here when it pulls in is pulling my shoulder in protraction forward is pulling it and tilting it down this way so now we get this real tilt forward of the shoulder it just an internal rotation that the PEC is giving us the PEC major but it actually giving this up pulling on our entire shoulder blade now go try to raise your arm up and guess how much you lack and your ability to actually do that a lot because you can major is tight you entire shoulder nice alright starting to say it so bluntly guys this is the truth your shoulders gonna take a beating if you don what I wanted to do is now show you how to stretch these knowing what these functions do because all you have to do when you stretch something is reverse the motion that the muscle is responsible for let me take you to show you how to do exactly that so you want to upwardly rotate your scapula that way okay here go up you don you want to retract your scapula you don to make sure that your posterior tilting your scapula and not anteriorly tilting it so we can do that the way we do that is we put our shoulder up here against something sturdy so inside of a wall will be perfect inside of a door jamb or a squat rack even as I a Smith machine doesn do it on but you should stabilize your the front of your glenohumeral joint here pushing it backwards so I nice position here ok so it stable up against then again I wall here ideally if I it them on the rack now I want to retract my scapula together behind me so if I do that you can see just here all I is pinching my shoulder blades back together we protraction if I do that now if I allow this to slide up then I get the upward rotation of the scapula - which is what we look what happens to the lines on my chest when I do this here I I rotation look at the distance now of the lines they because I can feel a nice good stretch right in there and again you hold it and you do you think 30 to 45 seconds ok now we going to go into the PEC major and the thing here is that it we want to stretch it but there things that you have to make sure you take note of because if you do this the wrong way you could actually wind up hurting yourself even more if you look at the PEC remember all we have to do to stretch the muscle is know where it starts and where it ends and we know it starts here and it ends here and it starts here and it ends here so if we can bring those two points further apart then we can get an effective stretch on the PEC so for the PEC major you want to position yourself again here in this doorway or whatever you able to stabilize the front of your shoulder on because we don this and this too much a lot of guys will find that when they do this all they do is shoot the head of the humerus to the front of the shoulder here and really start stretching out the anterior shoulder capsule that especially if you somebody that your shoulder joint so what you can do is make sure that that doesn forward this way by staying back set in the shoulder joint so we can do that by pushing up against here in the shoulder you know up against the doorframe or squat rack whatever you going to do then you raise your arm up to 90 degrees so now I lean forward into that stretch so I lean through the doorway this is keeping this set nice and back in the shoulder joint and I lean forward you can see the stretch if you want to intensify that all you have to do is look away and down so by peeking away and down I further stretch out in the chest from here to here it doesn the world whether I extend my elbow out here or I don if you do that is probably cause more likelihood that you that head of the humerus forward into the shoulder capsule and cause a problem so what you want to do is keep it in here it that you stretch by doing the fly and having your arms spread out far because it going to help with that stretch with the chest muscle with the PEC major you already reached the limits of its flexibility when you got to this point because this and this are as far apart as they do anything else for the distance between here and here so you stretch this out you do your chest PEC major stretch and you hold it for about 30 to 45 seconds and you continue to work on this guy said these muscles here they have a distinct command on the structure and the function and the posture of your whole entire shoulder girdle and if you do this and you allow yourself to get tight and you go back and do a lot of other upper body training you to wind up screwing up your shoulder so I don guys found this video helpful make sure you leave a comment and a thumbs up below I know it are the kind of videos that help you guys really understand what the hell is going on in your shoulder after all so that you can be more educated when you attack the gym and guys we take the educated approach here at athlean-x all of our workouts all of our programs every video we put up on this channel dedicated to helping to show you guys exactly how to do it so you know better the next time in all of our programs are dedicated to that too if you want to file and put the science back in strength head to athleanx.com and get her out the next training program Scott I quickest results in the safest way possible all right guys I here in just a couple days I hope you like this one I this shoot off of me now see	Success
Build Huge Shoulders - All 3 Heads!! (FRONT, MIDDLE, REAR)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRVFXFpIHDE	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what it going to break down the anatomy the front the side and the rear delt to help you to decode and understand any exercise that you the shoulder that you targeting and guess what we do to make that a lot easier that right we Cavaliers marker not the YouTube account thank you for that by the way but we actually going to break out Jeff cavaliere how this works okay so we what we because you guys have been finding it helpful to understand how the muscle anatomy works so when you look at the shoulder you can see if I put my arm here behind my back that what you can see pop out is this front delt so the front delt has an attachment to the outer third here of our clavicle okay so you can see the bone right in here so it starts here and it comes down it follows this line right here and it follows this line right here and then it all attaches down into the tuberosity here on our arm so you can see how the delt all kind of pops into this one spot so it kind of feeds down into that area so there your front delt so right away when we look at that you know that by the direction of these fibers if we want to make something contract you really want to try to bring these two points close to each other so we know that if we actually have some for of sort of extra exercise that brings this towards this this towards this then we can do that so check out some of the things I you here obviously a dumbbell front raise is going to do exactly that it going to bring the dumbbell towards the front one thing you may not realize though is sort of this this maybe better version of the front raise where I actually bring it up and across because as you can see if I have my arm here down at my side it need to kind of get it in at this angle so instead of just bringing a front raise up that way we up and across our body and I could do that here as you see with a cable or even with a dumbbell I sort of adduction component going on at the same time we also can do just a standard bench press because you can see right here as I do the bench press how this action is still happening here we front of our body and it a little bit too see as I demonstrate here you got this motion going on and that the front delt lastly if you your shoulder presses correctly your shoulder press should be done more out of the scapular plane meaning your elbow should be a little bit in front of your body so again now when we press up you active involvement of the front Del okay now we to the side and again the direction of the muscle the anatomy of the muscle is going to tell the whole story on how to activate it and we to the side delt so at the side it a little bit of a different orientation here we break out another Jeff cavaliere marker here to make this a little easier to see the acromium process which is the bump here on your shoulder you should probably be able to feel right towards the outside of your shoulder a bump that uh the side delt here is going to originate and again it of feed in and down just to the inside here down the arm again same spot down through here and the same thing is going to come around you can see where the rear Dell actually has its we to get to that one in a second down and in through here so now when we fill that muscle in you can see that the angle here is a little bit more favoring this outside or side uh Direction the the raising of the arm more out to the side as opposed to as I showed you here the front delt towards the front so what well obviously a side lateral raise you can see me doing that here but you can actually do a body weight version of this that I our athleen zero program where relatively the motion is the same we bringing our arm out to the side we abducting our arm to the side except I moving my body away from my arm here more than I am my arm away from my body same thing delt is actually getting a lot of the work you can also activate this with our dumbbell High pull now be careful when you over this a lot of times too when you elevate your arm you having some external rotation in your arm while you do that so you have your arm a little bit with your elbow down below your hand but you you can see that yes we by having that external rotation but you can see that the motion here is the same right it humoris as we come up so as we that yes the arm is in this position here but the upper arm is doing the same thing you can kind of break it down very simply it the upper arm is it coming forward is it going to the side or lastly as I to show you here is it going behind you back in that direction and so in a record Jeff Cavalier marker appearance we now have our third and this is the green this one into the realm of ink poisoning but that what we have is our rear delt and the rear delt actually starts here on the spine of our scapula okay the outer spine of our scapula or at least the outer third it Ridge as you can feel here through your scapula it can actually see it right here and it be a little harder for me to draw but then I come in and around and down and the same thing around the back down and it feeds in to the same spot and through here so we got this action not as good as my other drawings but it harder to reach so now what we bring our arm behind our body as we raise it so we can do a lot of things here to do that we can start off with a very easy reverse plate raise okay we going to see that by changing the orientation of our body it the very same move it it raise except by changing the orientation of our body now Against Gravity this muscle working a lot more the posterior Del is working a lot more so we use that exercise another exercise that people don delt a lot is a seated row when you get to the seated row position you taking the arm here as I showed you and you you can see as I do it even here you bringing it back behind the body it extension but it the upper arm in this direction because these fibers are going to go and pull like that as they contract they going to pull back so you can do that as well and then finally another great way to do this is with a face pull so you can see as I it again back behind the body taking the orientation of the fibers and working with them so as I pull here look you can see the action of the rear delt posterior delt I activating to pull me back so there lot of options and the more you understand the anatomy of the shoulder the easier it is for you to understand what the hell it is you the first place and if you have to draw on yourself to figure it out then draw on yourself to figure it out but the concept is this I me to I more simplified for you to understand how your body is working because when you know how your body so much more out of what the hell you doing I promise you you will if you looking for a training program that allows you to understand puts the science back in strength and helps you to understand how your body is training in the first place you get a better appreciation for that and then therefore can make much faster gains and results then head to aex.com

Bench Press for Upper Chest - (2 BIG MISTAKES!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUrfhmHszU8	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what athleanx.com we marker today to help you to get more out of the incline bench press no doubt one of the best upper chest exercises you can do if you can figure out a way to minimize the front delt from dominating the movement you see we know that these two muscles the front delt and the upper chest fibers they each other which means they can really start dominating one or the other if we don want to carry over and show you the two biggest problems with the exercise that most people are making and I can tell you it was backed up with a recent trip to the gym where our International chess day Friday now a lot of guys getting their swell on for the weekend there were so many guys doing incline bench incorrectly at the gym that I feel I felt like it warranted a video to recover this important topic so first of all what is the angle that you want to use on the bench in order to hit the upper chest the most now I that you want to totally exclude the front delt but the fact of the matter is our front delts get a lot of attention from a lot of the other exercises we not only doing the gym but just everyday activities that we do in front of our our body so if I were to do a shoulder press you guys know that we would do a upright shoulder press is going to maximize the attention that the shoulders get the front delts get why because it you can see this muscle is working and shortening up against the force of gravity okay right through here well if I were to back off the angle of the bench 30° to say 60° which is one of the most common places that people will do an incline bench press from then you going to yes shift the focus down a little bit but you can see this muscle is a pretty large muscle and it enough it down through the midbelly of the upper chest so 60 is not enough you might want to go a little bit lower and you can see me make that adjustment here on the bench down to 45° well 45° is again better anytime you start going lower and lower and lower you Focus down but remember flat bench press completely flat 0° that would represent one that middle chest so at 45° you even really there you bit more room to play and as a matter of fact research shows that 30° is the best angle for targeting the upper chest now that leads to the second point and as you see me bang out a couple reps of the 30° notice the position of my shoulder now the position my shoulder is key and this is why the 30° angle works better because when you look at these two muscles again I talked about the dominance of the front delt when the front delt becomes dominant our shoulders tend to round forward and I know a lot of people watching this are probably sitting here right now like this watching the video that unfortunately but what happens is the front delt is actually put in more of a position of power in relation to the chest it proud standing out actually willing and able to push more quickly and sort of spring to the to the task more quickly than your upper chest the way we can sort of Silence that is by getting it back where it belongs allowing the chest now to be in a better position to contract and the way we have to do that is through positioning our shoulders in the right the right direction so we want to be make sure that whenever we press the shoulder blades have to be back and down okay back and down what that does immediately you can see here is it puts the front delt again back in its place and allows the upper chest to be in a better position of pushing power because we flatter flatter on a 30° versus a 60 we place more naturally so you have to not only rely on the fact that the bench is helping you get there but you have to consciously be sure that you Contracting those shoulder blades to ensure that it stays there cuz a lot of us will continue to press and over time even as we fatigue more and more we trying to recruit a little bit of help from the front delt and that exercise falls apart so guys I hope you found this kind of detailed breakdown of the incline bench to be helpful remember this is about putting the science back in strength I don you oh do incline bench cuz it all know it that allows you to get better results faster when you follow our training and guys if you training program step by step put the science back in your strength you can head to aex.com right now and get our athletex training system if you found this video helpful if you like Jeff marker make sure you let me know in the comments below and I break it out again and do more of these detailed breakdowns all right guys I be back here again real soon	Success
Six Pack Workout | Obliques (26 REPS ONLY!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEBiX0yrcT0	ATHLEAN - X	what today I you should ever train your abs if you want to get results as a matter of fact we little bit put the science back in strength and oh yes we the markers this is four markers today guys you know what they say about guys with four markers so uh anyway so what we on the muscles here to show you what I talking about when you look at the ABS there of muscles that come into play we call this area the abdominal region obviously but there into play first and foremost you have your six-pack muscles which are the rectus abdominis that run this way okay so the direction of the fibers will tell you the contraction pattern of that muscle it likes to contract down up and down okay but that those aren have in our core we then have our external obliques that you can see right here the external obliques are coming in in this Direction so you can see by the orientation of those muscles that they like to rotate and create this sort of oblique Direction movement that they internal obliques they the opposite direction I of my colors here they go up this way so you can see they actually form like a cross-hatch pattern with the external obliques so now we know that they can come down that way so there you go now you got your final color here which is your transverse abdominis that runs like a weight belt straight across this way okay so it actually its function here is to cinch down the waist and and provide stability from within but it part of the overall abdominal area so if you only have two choices the first thing is you pick individual exercises that take your entire core through all those motions you got to have rotation you got to have top- down rotation right from here down you got to have bottom up rotation so this stays fixed and this rotates on the bottom you got to have the ability to do this traditional forward up and down crunching you have to have the ability to stop rotation right we want to be able to provide that stability using the transverse abdominus in preventing rotation and controlling rotation so you got all these things that you can do and I that down for you and all of our athenex training systems I give you are six-pack promise that actually breaks down all these exercises and and we group them into small workouts that allow you to hit all these these movements in one little AB training workout six seven minutes but you could also do what I have here and that is if you time I it you can do because it incorporate all these various motions at one time it come here to a hanging bar and what you doing straight up knee raises okay you of the knee raise which means you going to try to spell out every letter and you can see that right here as I start moving my legs around I kinds of rotation and stabilization I don Direction because I got to get back in the other direction we have that anti-rotation everything is being addressed at one time so what I want you to do is see if you can get up on the bar and then complete an entire alphabet so I go knee raise up and here and then across that and here then I go c big loop that way to the left D big loop back the other way e one of my favorite here then lower just a little bit and here lower just a little bit in here then come back up for an F right and then back up for G don forget the little tail right there H come halfway over back up and down you can see that you hit your entire core with all these sort of unpredictable movement patterns and that want guys I try to tell you all the time you can either train long or you can train hard but you can get a good ab workout in here it really difficult to make it through the entire alphabet and if you enough to do that there stopping you from trying to do it again if you that as I said includes all of our AB training and puts the science back in AB training along the way then head to aex.com and get our athex training system in the meantime if you like this one if you your comments and thumbs up below how far in the alphabet did you get before you had to cave in all right I back here again in just a couple days with another video I soon	Success

run into we our triceps that discomfort in our shoulders or to do the stretch wrong in the first place here the one you probably see all the time right pat yourself on the back grab your shoulder and pull back right pull on your elbow grab it pull it across sometimes you can see people doing this and that few things wrong with this yeah I broke out the pen to help you visualize what going on you see a lot of times we pull when we getting this pulling of the skin that you feel and you interpret as a tricep stretch it grab your shoulder like this and just pull your skin as hard as you can grab here and pull you stretching your muscles out but all you the skin here that sensation so that you here and do that a lot of times that what you you heads of the triceps they all start here on the other side of the elbow okay on the ulna right here the electrode on underneath here crossing the elbow joint and then they die into the actual upper arm okay somewhere on the upper arm here here but they the shoulder so in order to stretch those out all you have to do is bend your elbow as soon as you bend your elbow fully you muscles because that do they only cross the elbow joint the one you really feel when you stretching out the triceps is the long head of the triceps that one starts in the same spot wraps all the way around and it actually crosses the shoulder joint too because it attaches right here just underneath the ball and socket joint okay just right here on the scapula on your back okay so we have to figure out if we if we go up here when we get into this position our scapula and this point are certain distance apart okay okay where it starts where it attaches to there certain distance apart if I just bend here and do this right like gravity I knew this these two points are moving together they is no extra stretch going on here because these two points are no further apart than they were when we started if we want to get them to move apart further what we have to do is we got to keep that that scapula down and depressed here as we move our elbow further away from that point so we can do that by positioning ourselves over here up against the wall or a piece of equipment where you grab hold of your shoulder blade you can do it you just reach around wrap for the meat and then pull down on your shoulder blade okay you try to set it in place once you do that now you bend your elbow all the way so we get the stretches of tricep going already we lean into a trend to a wall here and then we and then lean our body in okay my neck can be free here the point is that my elbows bent all I can and now by keeping this shoulder blade down and then leaning in and allowing the machine or the wall to push my elbow further away now I head of the triceps now I can feel it and I pulling on my skin now one complication that a lot of people will feel me included with my bad out bout my bad shoulder is that this is a hard position to get into in the first place so people that use that stretch and feel like there example another way to do it so we can do it here on the floor I have a foam roller setup that allows us to do exactly this so I come down onto the floor on a foam roller and the key is that if you can if you get shoulder pain when you doing the tricep stretch a lot of times is because you don mobility and what happens is is if you can shoulder to get it up you getting a little bit of an opinion feeling up there we try to stretch your triceps out another reason why that version of the stretch the first version the wrong version isn do that though with a foam roller because we can work on two things you probably lacking one is external rotation your shoulders just by getting onto a foam roller and letting your arms sink back over your your the foam roller here in a 90 degree position gives me some extra gravity assisted external rotation the second thing is you lacking thoracic extension right when your thoracic spine rounds you can elevate your arm I guy a lot of times you can physically elevate your arm because of the blocking that happens so if we get out of foam roller we got thoracic extension through the foam roller we got this passive sort of assisted gravity extra rotation now we can come back here and reach and then pull over okay and we again grab back and pull over from here I forearm at that point and I pinch my shoulder blades down and back it try to keep my scapula down as I try to pull back this way but it for me a little bit more comfortable because I have a better position through the thoracic extension here because of the foam roller so guys you got to start if you stretch out your triceps you want to learn how to do them right if you going to invest the time to train you better learn how to start training right we train like athletes here at athleanx.com and the whole point of this is want to make sure you right so I put all these videos together and put all the programs we have

How to Stretch Your Biceps (FEEL IT INSTANTLY!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e1hQUxTAHc	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what today I stretching your biceps the right way and let it biceps get ignored when it comes to stretching our muscles because we just don in terms of a muscle that we would stretch but they are one of the postural muscles that tend to be shortened a lot of times during the day if we at at a computer and we biceps are in a flexed position pretty much all the time if we our biceps are in a flexed position all the time we don stretched out so far to give our biceps an adequate stretch and therefore it it makes it even more important that we pay some attention to it how you stretch the biceps though is really important a lot of times guys will do this you them doing this and they their elbows straight and they pushing down they out the biceps there majorly wrong with this number one when you hold your hand on top here our bodies tend to do what comes naturally and that is we kind of fight the isometric Force we give back as much as we it mechanism for our joints so what we doing here is almost creating an own battle between our hand pushing down and our arm pushing up which means that the bicep is never really going to relax so that doesn this is our hand is supinated or our wrist is supinated here well we know that the bicep functions to superate the arm so if we want to stretch it we going to want to pronate it the third component is one that people Overlook all the time when it comes to biceps and that is the function of the fact that they do actually Flex the shoulder they bring the shoulder up in front of us so if we really want to stretch the biceps out especially the long head you want to get extension of the shoulder so to combine all these together this is what you behind you there something that you can grab on behind you first you pronate your hand down right because you want to take the bicep again I drew them myself to show you this you can see that just by suating here suating actually you know obviously activates the bicep itself okay so you can see it moving right there so if we pronate the hand in other words turn the forearm down we can put it on stretch the second thing we do is we get ourselves again with a straight elbow because we know that it flexes here the arm so we go down to a straight elbow straighten out as far as we can then with it pronated we go and we reach back behind our body here so that we have our arm now in extension and then the last thing we do is we step a little bit away so right now I kind of have it in line with the side of my body okay the last two things we do is we ex we tighten and contract the tricep by doing that now we reciprocal inhibition we of shutting off the bicep to allow for a bigger stretch so they contract the tricep and at the same time I step a little bit away this way so that now I that angle away from my body not just straight behind the reason why we do that is by taking that last little step away here now with the arm positioned out we uh to to be turned a little bit further away from us right now the groove kind of lines up right down in here and it pretty close to the front of our shoulder okay as we as the upper arm how the bicep the biceps Groove lines up when we turn turn it a little bit away you can see that these are the two points when I do that now I bit further away from each other Okay so we the triceps here then step away just a little bit and now I and man I can feel it my hands pronated down and I can feel that stretch on the bicep so there you go guys if you want to start stretching your biceps out this is the way to do it and if you never realize you should this is your cue to start doing it because as I said everything we do in a day is going to be done with our arms flexed even me here talking to you yes I have the tendency to keep my arms in this position it little bit more comfortable speaking position than doing this and standing here like a tin soldier but it will not help you in terms of getting your arms and your biceps stretched out which you want to let those muscles start developing fully the way they should I hope you guys found this video helpful if you like these stretching videos you want more of them then make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below and if you with me at the helm to kind of take you through as a physical therapist and not just tell you what to do but teach you why you more long lasting effects then make sure you head to aex.com and get our 90-day training system athletex I here guys in just a few days again four times a week I let me know you want to see and I will try to bring them to you uh each and every week see you soon	Success
Pull Up Problems (SOLVED!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U4XgPQnLdc	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what coming to you from the Gateway to the West St Louis Missouri I question as you can see my wide grip pull-ups when I start to fatigue I lose my form I to 8 to 10 reps I nothing seems to work when I get fatigued my shoulders will not let me stay under the bar do I continue pull-ups or do I stop and get ready for the next set once I start to lose my farm I signed up with your program 5 years ago when I retired so I could get in shape and enjoy my great grandkids I don would not let anybody take them but I never expected to look like this at 70 before after I love you man hey loell thank you for your question it actually a very good question it common problem not just with pull-ups but anytime you have to hang from a bar a lot of it has to do with strength and stability and maybe not necessarily in the areas that you thinking your shoulders but really it more in your back and your shoulder blades and specifically what is the stability and the strength in your lower traps or possibly even your seratus to be able to keep your shoulder blades attached and in contact with your rib cage as you go up and down what happens is the fatigue starts to set in and you lose the ability to keep your shoulder blades together and they start to drift out that allows you or causes you to start drifting away from the bar because your shoulders just can pinned back position as you go up and down we want to be able to rotate our scapula up and down as we raise up but stay in contact with our rib cage so there start doing number one first of all two let times people can under a bar because their core is not strong enough I would say check that first and make sure that you have adequate core strength if you find that when you you can immediately uh uh find yourself much more steady then you might want to work on building up your core strength by doing some hanging uh uh ab strengthening exercises but if we go back to the extra work that I was going to prescribe for you here you go to a bench and you do what we call sort of a stable why the stable why is it forces you to First stabilize and engage the lower traps by really pinching your shoulder blades down and back together and then performing a dumbbell y up and overhead you don unless you first set and established the stability and the contraction there between your shoulder blades before you do the move you would do this in a few extra sets a few extra times per week to try to start developing some additional strength then before you even go back to the pull-up bar you go and you do this modified version of a pull-up we sort of focus on that upper half of the pull-up the part that trouble you do that by setting the bar here at about shoulder height and then positioning yourself underneath and what you going straight up and down focus on driving straight up your chin towards the bar without any of the swaying but we do this by setting the shoulder blades back and down and maintaining that throughout again it range of motion so it here for us and you don about as much sway because you right here again knees touching the ground at every single rep now try to work on this and try to incorporate a little bit more strength here and you increase the top end strength of your pull-ups But to answer your question about whether you need to ditch pull-ups Al together while you not at all you 9 10 from what I can see here in this video in great form so we talking about what happens as you fatigue keep pushing through those there it allow you to build a little bit more pull-up strength and not just drop off the bar the second it gets difficult for you but it more shoulder stability as you continue here down the road so you do more correct pull-ups without the cheat down the road I hope that makes a lot of sense here for you so all this together is what you really want to do and guys there our body uses to get ourselves around what we do if you to start training your body the way it meant to be trained and start becoming a lot more strong from your toes all the way to your fingertips then got to start training like an athlete that do here at athleten X in the mean time if you want your question answer just like loell I tell you all the time send your question video question to medor relations aex.com I address right down here and we through them and do our best to get to your question here in one of the four videos a week that we do on our Channel all right guys we be back here again with another video uh very very soon see you	Success
Muscle Cramps Working Out (WHAT REALLY CAUSES THEM!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da3SvJ5elOE	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] hey Jeff this is Chris from Arkansas I 34 and I for the last 8 to 10 months my ex Jeff question is what between a cramp and a contraction During certain moves like Cable Crossovers I get a bad cramp here under my armpit when I do things like bicep curls I get a big cramp right here at the front of my arm and when I try to do things like barbell hip thrusts I get Charlie Horse cramps in my hamstrings now keep in mind I do an 8 to 12 minute Dynamic warm-up prior to working out as well as a static stretch routine nightly thanks for all your information and keep up the great work thanks Chris it good question you see when people tighten up or cramp up during an exercise the first thing they think is going on is that they they out so if you you even the way I showed you a couple weeks ago they they problem a lot of times is that the cramping is really a substitution for stability where you so if you think about it this way if you get cramping in your bicep it might be that your actual your bicep isn to handle the load that you subjecting it to so it cramps to provide stability to the Joint to the Elbow so that you can actually get through the movement without damaging it but a cramp isn because a cramp will hurt as you well know so what we want to do is we want to try to strengthen the muscles that are cramping more and we do this not in a contracted position so if you to strengthen the bicep you would not do it in an exercise that places Peak Contra you know Peak tension at Peak contraction so like with a a spider curl where I peak contraction and Peak tension at the same point that to a lot of cramping the same thing happens with a bridge as you describe bridging up in in at Peak contraction of the glutes and maybe into the hamstrings you for the bicep you try to get an exercise that places Peak contraction or Peak tension in the middle of the the strength curve so for a barbell curl we get it somewhere around here but as I get to the very top where I contracted I actually don tension there so you try to increase your strength and all the exercises that don in the peak contraction State once you do that you build up your strength in those exercises you go back to doing the exercises that were causing the problem and you should have no problems anymore at least you should find it to be dramatically reduced of course make sure you because a muscle can easily cramp at a lot higher rate and frequency when when it dehydrated State okay so I hope you found this uh helpful and remember guys if you want your ask jef question answered here all you got to do is make sure you send me one record a video of you asking the question that on your mind and I will do my best to answer it here in a future a jef segment in the meantime guys if you found this video helpful make sure you leave a comment and a thumbs up below and uh I see you	Success
Wrist and Forearm Pain with Curls (AX JEFF!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6GYRlK7q2s	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] hi Jeff um this is Sor from India and uh my ask Jeff question is when when I doing my bicep curls I get a very sharp and a nagging pain in the this portion of my wrist and it only happens during the exercise which involves the Bobble girl so the outer parts aches a lot and I not able to twist it in this direction and this is fine this this movement and this movement is having a problem with that so thank you thanks my man for the question it question cuz this is a common problem that guys will have when they are doing the curls especially with the barbell and a lot of it is anatomical and a lot of it also has to do with how we performing the barbell curl so I why it pain in that spot right on the inside part of the wrist maybe even R radiating down into the forearm and more importantly what you can do so you can start doing curls again and not have to suffer that pain if you looked at at the anatomical part of this right we have two bones that make up our form we have the radius here and then we have the on the underside so the radius anatomically is longer than the UL so you can see right as I put my fingers on the corners of those two bones you can do this yourself just hook right on the end of your of your wrist you middle finger here is on top of the radius that than the edge and end of my Ola which is right here okay what happens is our body wants to equalize that difference so there disc that sits right in between the end of the Ola and then into the carpal bones so we kind of we close that gap down of the length difference between the two sides keep that in mind cuz now we go grab a barbell and we go try to do our barbell curls what happens is as you try to curl a barbell think about what you might do you might try to start lifting like getting more of your body English into the move to help you to lift that heavier weight well what happens is your elbows almost come underneath a little bit because what you little bit of help from your pecs as you squeeze them together you doing a little bit of a of a crossover underneath and lifting that way so as you do that you get shoulders involved too as you do that your wrists are actually feeling this type of torque and force even though they the straightness of the bar but as you do this and you weight down you supination here at the wrist well take this turn your wrist upside down okay like this bend it back and pull down and even guys that don wrist are going to find that the inside portion of the wrist right in that area where that disc is you feel some pain because you that and causing a pretty uncomfortable sensation you do that over and over and over again you could actually wear down and cause damage to that cartilage uh disc that in between the Ulta and your carpal bones so again as you curl up and you that that uh supination and downward force and that causes that pinch so the two things you can do to fix it number one are lift a little bit lighter weight because if you and you can keep it nice and strict your RIS will stay nice and neutral like this and you can probably curl it without much pain or even better if you want to start curling the heavier weight and not have the pain use an easy bar because the Easy Bar will give your wrist a chance to be in this position here so now when I curl up I of that uh that torque right there at the disc I hope you found this answer helpful I know it you start going back and focusing on the way you maybe the alternative way to do it with an easy curl bar in the meantime guys if you want to have your question answered here on Ax jef remember this is my way to give back to you guys you supported our Channel now over a million subscribers we do have a million subscriber video coming stay tuned but I want to make sure I answer more of your questions make sure you send them down here to Min relations aex.com and make sure guys their videos because the videos are going to be what I play here to answer your question all right I see you back here again really soon	Success
Back Rows - Cables, Barbell or Dumbbells (2 BEST TIPS!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnnZr62A94s	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] Hey Jeff, my name is Mike and I currently living in Omaha, Nebraska. And my question for Athleen X is how to avoid bicep substitution in any kind of back row exercise. One of the biggest frustrations I have and and why I unmotivated to work my work on my back is because every single time I try to do a a back exercise, whether it be a um dumbbell row or or a machine row, I find that I biceps than I am for my back. Um so, is there anything that I can do to uh fix this? Because, you know, I definitely want to see some improvement in my back. Um thank thanks for your question, Mike. It here and it relates to weaknesses that we have in our back muscles to begin with that force other muscles to do their job for them. That something that because we are masters of compensation. We Even if it supposed to do it. That body is all about. But if we want to start building your back better, we better make sure your biceps are quieting themselves down to allow the back to do that job. So here things you that actually will work. The very next time you do a row, you should be able to instantly feel them. Firstly, you want to try to minimize not just the bicep, but your forearm contribution. Anytime that you row, your your body is in a natural pulling movement. So, it to do anything it can to utilize other pulling muscles. And the two big ones distally closest to your dumbbell or the bars if you your wrist flexors for your forearm and your bicep uh which will be your elbow flexor. So, as you start to do this, any type of movement like this is going to cause a lot of the muscles on the back side to not have to do their job. So, the simple fix is bend your wrist back. Right off the bat, you not allowing the forearms to kickstart the curling movement or that pulling movement. Now, you lead a lot more with the muscles on your back and lead with your elbows as you pull back. Instantly, you should feel the lats do much more of the work than you ever have if you actually allow your wrist to curl forward. even trying to keep them in a neutral position which would be right here even with the camera. So get them bent back before you even do the exercise and even when you Take a grip on the bar with a slightly extended position and pull back that way. You should instantly be able to feel the difference. The second thing relates to again that weakness in a particular muscle here and that is the rhomboids between your shoulder blades. If you want your lats to be able to work and work as strongly as they possibly can, you want to try to provide a stable platform and surface for them to work off of. Give them something. It trying to jump off of a of a balloon. You would if you solid surface. So, you can generate more force when you have a stable platform. So, before you do any type of rowing movement outside of what I already told you here for your hands, try to set your scapula. Pull your shoulder blades back and together. Don all. Just pull your shoulder blades back and towards each other. Then from there, you initiate the move. You just setting your scapula, you to pass on a lot more force production to your lats to do a better job at pulling, therefore feel them more during the workout, therefore get them to grow each and every time you start doing your rows from here on out. I hope you found this question and answer helpful, Mike. And guys out there, this is Team Athleen.

Working Out after Hernia Surgery (AX JEFF!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNdctm7js0M	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] Hey Jeff, how are you? Hey again, thanks for everything you do for us. A question for you. Um, just went in for X-ray yesterday. Potential inguinal hernia. I in and uh have surgery. wonder if you or any of your subscribers have had uh experience with it and uh what I am going to be looking forward to over the next four to six weeks. Everything I read looks like it uncomfortable. So, uh I forward to it, but it is the only way to um repair these things. So, uh any help on that would be great. My name is Doug Goldstein out here in El Dorado Hills, California, and this is my axe Jeff question. Thanks. Hey Doug, thanks for your ask Jeff question. So, when it comes to hernas, I expert here on staff of Athletics X because I unfortunately I And yes, you should get them repaired. A lot of people will wait a long period of time. I know people have waited years to get theirs done. My first one, I waited about 3 or 4 years. But progressively the pain gets more and more and you run the risk of causing more and more complications, serious complications that will not only become a lot more life-threatening, believe it or not, but they going to take you to recover from your your hernia surgery. So, if you go in there electively, as it seems like you are now, that what you it some pain. you getting an abdominal surgery. So, you going to have some pain and discomfort in that area, but because of the way they do this, if you mesh surgery that they do laparoscopically, all they basically placing a mesh on the inside of your abdominal cavity that pushes out and covers the hole. If you were to bear down or try to do some sort of even an ab exercise itself, all you pushing the mesh further in place with the interabdominal pressure that you generating. So, you running the risk of damaging the repair. So, it the only thing I is pain or discomfort. The old way they used to do is they used to put it on the outside so that if you did push any further, the sutures that were holding the mesh in place did run the risk of actually breaking and you damaging the repair. So, what did I do 2 to 3 days after I was done with my uh surgery? I was down on the ground doing very, very basic limited core movements. I knew that if I can get my core active just trying to re-engage and get things woken up down there that I chance of speeding up my recovery. And I firmly believe that I did. I will say though, anything hanging like a pull-up or forget any type of hanging ab exercises that took me the longest because we know that as soon as you hold the bar, you better have really good core strength to be able to hold yourself steady. That was just misery for me. So, it took me probably about four to five weeks before I can even somewhat hang on a bar and before I can start cranking out pull-ups again. probably about 6 to 7 weeks, but there no stopping you if you can get in there, do this thing electively, and start doing some of these more conservative ab exercises after you thanks for the question, guys. Remember, this is now a new feature that we have here on this channel. Ask me your question, and I your answer if it right, I few days.	Success
How to Fix Uneven Pecs (2 WAYS!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeTNtWyn-0g	ATHLEAN - X	hi my name is Sarah hill from Laredo Texas and my AHF question is how can I properly form my pecs I following your workouts and I do get results on both muscles I do feel the growth I feel more like my right PEC has better shape and I want to see how I can balance them out and have this one start forming properly so any tips you can give me would really help what question that is a great question it actually very very very very common matter of fact yours truly doesn balanced pecs you see if you look here at mine you see that basically this PEC here my left PEC kind of takes a sharp turn and heads out this way whereas this one kind of comes all the way down to the top here of my abs and it comes over and it makes its turn so what causes it what can you do to fix that if that your issue nothing you see it about how your muscles attach and here as they attach to the sternum for whatever reason this here this area is just not attaching all the way immediately as much as the my PEC on my right the fibers come all the way here and attach right on to the sternum whereas here they just don the way across they attach her to the very outer portion remember your sternum is going to kind of splay out here at the bottom so they the outer portion of the sternum they obviously you still have to connect to bone in order to be anchored but they attaching way further out on my sternum and let coming all the way onto the top right down the midline so if that problem though if there let smaller than the other that problem can be addressed in two different ways number one you want to do a little bit of unilateral work because especially if you first thing I want to do is swap in some dumbbells because we bring the dumbbells into play it forces you to be a little bit more in command of each side individually right you want to try to move them together so it cause you to not be able to rely on one stronger side than the other the second thing you can do actually part of that so that those dumbbells in your hands try to put down the one on your strongest side and do the one on your weaker side by itself I know it sounds crazy it might actually increase the length of your workout but it squeeze and try to gain more muscle control over that muscle likely if it a lot smaller than the other I bet you to contract that muscle and they are independent of each other you can have one that and something more in control of what you do than the other so especially if you so what you squeeze and let the other hand be your guide it should be doing something should just be hanging out here so touch right on the the fibers of the chest here and as you contract try to make them contract hard under your fingers try to make the muscle do the work okay that you can do is to just add a little bit of additional volume to that side so on another day when you movement or pushing muscle group right you can come in with some additional one-arm chest work on that day to increase your overall volume for sort of a work cycle so if you body over the course of a week or five days or eight day whatever your training cycle is you want to get a little additional volume per cycle in you could do that by incorporating a few added sets of that same side and again work your way up as you can and wait you see that just with that additional mind muscle control if you with an issue like I am that you going to start to see those pecs balance out so - I hope this helped you and I hope anybody else out there that dealing with especially a PEC imbalance that this will clarify at least which direction you you really can something you do have an opportunity to guys this is the axe Jeff question remember you can get your question answered here on our axe Jeff videos once a week if you send your question to media relations at athleanx.com remember video question guys send it over to me and I right here on this channel I guys back here soon we got more videos here coming for you four times a week so I got some work to do I here soon	Success
Intense Ab Workout | 7 Minutes (FOLLOW ALONG!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHD1-2P94DI	ATHLEAN - X	what athletenext.com now if you want to get a six pack you gotta give me seven minutes not once repeatedly but here seven minutes makes it very very doable it makes it something that you can actually stick to and i will tell you this the biggest secret for me for allowing me to get abs from the time that i had none until now was consistency and if it wasn could do quickly that i didn do it i know you can do this this is exactly what i did and here going to prove i through this workout with you today all right i want to prove to you that i not going to ask you to do something that i wouldn going to go through this and i this to you before i actually did a seven minute workout for you before if you haven the end of the video as well but if you choose the right exercise you can get the job done quickly it its toll but fast we have our six-pack shuffle here it actually comes with all of our programs all we have to do is just hit the shuffle button here and what option for us to choose the different types of equipment we want to use now for this workout i want to make it something that we all could do no excuses so we weight only and then we could choose again the difficulty level all right i going to choose sort of a moderate level here not beginner but not really really hard sort of a moderate level here again it so we of course now we kick up the workout here you can see what i a seven minute workout like i said that starts off with the lower ab movement here called the seated ab circle so you can see i direction here for the entire 60 seconds we then we the other side too right so for the next 60 seconds we the opposite direction and then we going to get a little bit of bottom up rotation because that functions of the abs and the drunken mountain climber allows us to do that not just driving our knees straight in but actually allowing for rotation as we do them we finally get this little much needed 30 second rest period and then we come right out of that and we go on to our marching plank again i don standard planks i don stay there i have to do something in our planks and this is a one thing that we can do here is we can march throughout the entire 60 seconds we then move on to a scissor and with the scissor we getting some rotation at the bottom of our of our torso here that put some extra stress on the obliques but if that wasn to throw in my starfish crunch because you guys hate that i mean you love that it brutal exercise we we only have to do it though for 30 seconds you do get your 30 second rest period but you of that and finish with our russian v-tuck twist just for 30 seconds to wrap this all up seven minutes all right so now i through the workout take us through it but you got me too all right we going through this together so we ab circle seated circles for lift the legs up and make big circles up into the left now the key here two things whenever you do your ab training you want to try to put yourself a little bit into a zone because it and you want to think about it you don want to feel it every single second you put yourself in that little place a little quiet place where your abs just keep cranking out reps and you is burning but i makes you feel any better mine already are so you oh shut up jesse he going ten seconds left all the way around up into the left three seconds change direction we get about a little five seconds now i gotta head the opposite way one up into the right now here if you much they that you may find that you can complete this what you want to do is squeeze with the abs let the abs do the work okay can i tell them jesse how you screwed up we actually did this workout a few minutes ago with the camera and i had to actually do this now twice could i tell them that no you look bad so it because i minutes but 14 right here just you know to remind you [Music] we we despite jesse trying to sabotage me ten seconds left up it to the right again use the abs not the hip flexors [Music] for 60 seconds 50 seconds two one here so your regular mountain climber is right here we driving in with the abs don guys because it a lot harder it actually might come with a little bit of a surprise at the end you want to puke all over the place 30 seconds i heard her say i swear [Music] i believe i too ten seconds left i heard that 10 seconds 30 seconds we need it guys good job so far good job you see i told you i do this every day every day it doesn but the thing is when it you know you can stick to it right anybody can stick to you know and gut through some discomfort we can see the other side of the finish line all right that rest is over too fast [Music] nice control tighten your glutes here most of all tighten your abs a little happy place instead this is exactly where you want to be right now oh yeah 30 seconds left dancing little carrot cakes in my head [Music] to a rhythm before you know it she say 10 60 seconds left just like that scissors for 60 seconds begin in 5 60 seconds all right here i could do these for an hour maybe not [Music] [Music] nope like i right now 30 seconds left oh that i thought that was a sunburn i lost my abs that are killing me about 15 seconds use those abs 10 seconds left starfish crunch 30 seconds one two arms out out and touch your toe towards your toe everybody everybody yeah [Music] ten seconds left just in time 30 second rest all you need after that people are saying right now they saying if this is this hard for jeff how am i gonna do it guys do as much as you can even if you have to bail halfway through the 30 seconds there so what 10 seconds go for 20 and then rest the extra 10 seconds and then keep working up to it last one russian v-tuck twist i feel freshers and daisy [Music] drive one knee in touch to the opposite side ah legs off the ground ten seconds left last 10 seconds guys good job good job all seriousness like i said six pack abs are built just seven minutes at a time six minutes five minutes six minutes eight minutes in that range the idea is you don to devote a half hour every day to train your abs the key is short intense workouts that get the job done and stay consistent with it if it could do with no equipment at all and that for you to do if you step-by-step programs guys i walk you through everything there i never let you you know do it on your own as a coach i to walk you through everything you do those are all available at athletics.com if you haven

Get a Â6 PackÂ in 22 Days! (HOME AB WORKOUT)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6PhNnlb-14	ATHLEAN - X	what athletenext.com so 22 days for a six-pack well okay let like this right now then 22 days is not going to deliver your six-pack but hold on i got some encouraging news for you too the idea is that i showed you before in previous video that you can actually get a six-pack to show at much higher body fat levels than maybe you thought like even in the mid teens you could actually see not necessarily a real sharp six-pack but you can see them so that part the second thing though is we we know that if you follow a good nutrition plan that you can carve away your abs more and more because you lose some of the overlying body fat so the guy that was up in that range he does have hope if he can kind of get that nutrition part but does tend to be a little difficult i get it but what we need to do is we need to change habits and right now we find ourselves in a situation where changing our habits is something we world around us is forcing us to change our habits so what we have to do is take advantage of that and we know that 22 days is a period that allows us to actually implement changes to habits if we could do something for 22 days we can actually see changes so even if you starting out at kind of a higher level than expected here up in the 30 range if you do what i going to start to adopt a new way of eating hopefully paired up with your ability to stick to this for 22 days which will get you on the right track and change your life so what are we doing we can all do everybody can do it because it six exercises it here on the floor with nothing else and i and the way we do that is with a technique we use in a previous video called extinction training and what extinction training does is it takes a nap exercise let you raise for our lower abs the rep goal here is just five if you could do five rest 10 seconds you do it again you rest 10 seconds you do it again you rest 10 seconds you do it again ultimately even the most advanced is not going to be able to recover in those 10 seconds and you to get all five so at that point you become extinct you move on to the next exercise so every exercise has either a rep or a time that you have to perform it for and when you can move on so we can see that even the beginners might just kind of get knocked out in the very first round or second round but that room for improvement so that being said let workout and you can see the w raise here is kind of three parts we letting our legs start from low towards the ground down just halfway back up to the top try to clear your hips off the ground come back down go back to the outer leg of the w again and then you come all the way back down again and then you come back up and reverse the w so you can see with my arms here i going all the way up with the legs down just halfway back up lift the pelvis down up here and then all the way down to the ground and repeat until you can all five as soon as you can to the next exercise the next one here is the black widow knee slides and this is something we talk about working bottom up rotation and you can see as i cross my knee over and drive it into that opposite elbow i rotation and of course i have to lift that knee and slide it up the forearm which creates more of that posterior pelvic tilt more of the ab engagement this is done for 45 seconds so if you get through all 45 seconds you then rest 10 seconds and you can go again you can see it the most advanced to do a whole hell of a lot of sets here at 45 seconds a piece with just a 10 second rest so you are going to get caught up at some point even if you training we move on to the next exercise it arms actually provide you with a little bit of momentum to help to get you off the ground but at the same time we kind of open up a little bit extra benefit from the backside muscles of our upper back can never go wrong with that but the fact is we do this for 10 butterfly setups to get to our extinction number when we can on the next exercise is the seated corkscrew because now we want to take it we want to work not just the rectus abdominus but the obliques and we talk all the time about how the obliques work to sort of taper in and visually taper in the midsection so we can do that with the seated corkscrew you simply put your hands back behind your body you drive your knees in and across really trying to contract the obliques this is another one of those timed exercises where we see if we can last for the entire 45 seconds and if we can we earn that 10 second rest and we repeat as many times as we can possibly do that again beginners might find that they can even get through the first 45 seconds but that place to start and to improve upon and you this workout can grow with you for as long as you want it to but again 22 days here on to the last two exercises the first of which is the levitation crunch and i love this one for what we call top down movements where we move the upper torso without moving the lower torso we know that that to do because the weight of the legs is not one of those factors that we have to really accommodate for and what we do is we off of the ground you simply lift yourself up and try to clear them off the ground and what you do is you try to hold and pause at the top that the levitation part comes in for like a one or two count we really try to make the upper abs work and hold that contraction 10 good quality contractions and then finally the workout wraps up with the sit-up elbow thrust this is our top-down rotation move here we to just do five to each side you can see it i come and i sit up and i drive across my body and i come back to center and i lower myself down come up and drive across the body center and down five repetitions to each side again the goal being get all five rest ten seconds and try to get five and five again rest ten seconds try to get five and five again again at this point this exercise might not have been so difficult in the beginning but because you going to catch up to you and you may not be able to do all that many rounds of five and five and five and five this exercise here again caps off this workout but guys remember it consistency of doing this workout just make the commitment do it with me you know it you can start low and finish high you just got to make sure you days is all i you you develop that habit that will set you up for a lifetime and hopefully a whole new lifestyle and maybe this whole situation that we right now is an opportunity here that we can embrace and gets us on the right track so if you guys where we actually take advantage of those habits that you ingrained and take it to the whole other level that over at athleanx.com you can find them there in the meantime if you found the video helpful if you pass around to somebody else take the challenge together you can leave your comments and thumbs up below

The Â22 DayÂ Ab Workout (NO REST!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VsDP584zyQ	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com so what are you doing for the next 22 days I hope what I show you here today I put together a 22-day ab workout and guess what we simplified everything because I to remove some of the excuses we going to use any equipment and we going to have to worry about all these different exercise variations what we going to do is give you a workout though that adap to your ability level and I going to pick 22 days as my day and my Target because we know that it takes about 22 days to develop a habit if you can stick with this workout it going to take you long if you can stick with this workout for 22 days in a row who knows you might be on your way to a whole new dedication to your body and fitness because you this here going to make it adaptable to your current ability level we do that with an Extinction style training so with Extinction you Target rep or a set time that you going to focus on and try to last for each exercise six exercises here following our normal progression for ab training if you can make it that time you earn yourself another round 10 seconds and another round of that same exercise Advanced people can be at this and can do this and can finally you know get a challenge no matter how advanced they think they are if you intermediate you off somewhere in between if you the beginning stages of your ab training you can still try this if you need an ab workout as an alternative I in the bottom in the description below for that but if you want to try this go for it if you reach Extinction in every single exercise in your first time through so what you good ab training in so guys I lay out all the exercises for you I going to describe what each one working remember we different Extinction goal for each one let heels to the heavens we have a lower ab exercise why because we bottom half and we fixed top half so with the heels to the heavens you see me doing here if you a beginner again you want to try this you have two things you can do you want to aim for pushing up straight up through the ceiling get your hips off the ground just don say somebody that advanced do this for 45 seconds this is your extinction level again if you don make it all the way through that you exercise right away if you do make it for the 45 seconds you get a 10-second rest and you have to repeat this exercise again you keep doing that resting 10 seconds after each completed round until you cannot make the 45 seconds and then you move on to the next level you see this is how we accommodate people of all levels of ability nobody is getting away with an easy workout here okay moving on now we go bottom up rotation so again lower half moving and rotating this time on a fixed top half and we do that with our step through plank so look at here we going to take our body we keeping our top cell our top of our body fixed here by keeping our forearms in contact with the ground and the shoulders facing the ground but we going to rotate the hips as I step through alternating from one side to the next the idea here is you again a 45 second Extinction time if you can last the whole 45 seconds you doing it again until you cannot next we move on to our mid-range movement here we want to hit both the top and the bottom moving together and we can do that with what we call our X-Man crunch for the first time Extinction is not a time goal it understand what that means by now the rep goal here is 12 you this exercise here it you complete vit position here you just want to bring your legs and your hands all together towards the top and then come back down into this x position leg spread out arms spread out and continue to repeat 12 reps here is your Extinction goal moving on we got to hit the obliques too because they obviously count I tell you all the time they taper in that Med section so what we do is an alternating thread the needle the alternating thread the needle is going to take the thread the needle exercise that I you left and right so you take it here you reach up to the sky from here you got to thread the needle and reach all the way under don we come back out of it come down settle and then repeat to the opposite side go all the way up come down reach through come back out of it settle in the middle and go back Extinction here is reps once again it can make it all the way through if you can great job you just earned yourself 10 10 more to each side if you didn we anyway okay we got two left here the top down movement comes first when don talking about if the bottom up was a fixed top and a movable Bottom now it kind of trying to keep the bottom as stationary as possible and we the top down on top of that okay now the jack knife is going to allow us to do this there the legs but it so we get here in this position you have your hands out and arms out straight and you crunch from the top let the leg move up just a little bit higher than the other one settle back down and go to the other side you keep going back and forth here this is back to time again we to go for 45 seconds on this alternating jack knife let as you can when you reach Extinction you got one exercise left all right finally we got to go top down again but this time rotation and we do it with what we call a stationary bike see people do bicycles all the time and they basically go so fast that they even cont in or working their muscles in with any real Focus or attention but with the stationary bike we so I get down on the ground here knees come up to 90° hands go behind my head not clasping or pulling on my neck and what I a little bit of contraction here get that top already contracted pulled off the floor shoulder blades off the floor and I one elbow towards the opposite knee the other elbow towards the opposite knee don stationary that basically we want to make sure that we 30 seconds this is not that easy it lot harder than whipping away at reps on one of those classic bicycles you going to get a lot more out of this 30 second Extinction when you make it all the way through this and really when you fail to make it all the way through this your workout has ended all right so there you have it again simple we going to eliminate all the excuses the equipment the exercise variation but not easy all right and I don going supposed to be easy nothing worth having should come easy give this one a try no matter what ability level you are and if you can work your way up over the course of the 22 days then take advantage of that and go for it guys if you the science back in strength trains you the way you should allows muscles to work the way that they want to work head to athletes.com and get our athletex training program that train you like an athlete this is just one glimpse of that in the meantime if you found the video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up

7 Minute Ab Workout (6 PACK PROMISE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jyhJ6TiUPA	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what one thing that drives me nuts is when I ask somebody how long they spend doing their abs and the response is anything more than say 10 minutes because if you your abs you if you trade in some of that excess repetition for more intensity you only get a better ab workout but you be done quicker I want to show to you today exactly how we can do that by actually getting down the floor and doing the workout with you real time and this one ain all it be difficult I want to see if you can hang with me while we do this what are we doing we six-pack promise which we include with all of our athex training systems and it gives you the ability to shuffle an ab workout just like that and produce a workout that single day that follows our progression of how we like to train ABS we like to start with the bottom up movements we like to include bottom up rotation we go mid-range we go top down rotation so we the a including the obliques as well but we do it and follow it right here on our phone too so that being said what does the workout look like come look over my shoulder while I show you the first thing that we have here is our figure eight the figure eight is a is a workout that again is starting with that bottom uh that bottom rot that bottom up movement and rotation as well we move to a leg straight windshield wiper for 60 seconds okay no rest in between these exercises that again now more bottom up rotation then we go to twisting Pistons okay now we we top stabilizing we got a mid-range Movement we finally get a 30 second rest period thank God and we come out of that with our starfish crunch for 30 seconds now again we rotation okay we go we do that we move into our tuck plank on the same side for 60 seconds that looks like this we movement here our upper Circle crunch 60 seconds clockwise 60 seconds counterclockwise why cuz when we have the least amount of energy these are going to be the easiest movements to per uh perform but at this point in the game it let running welcome to six we got an audio coach here she motivate [Music] us [Music] we start the figure eight point our toes to the left when we go that way point our toes to the right here which you can see this is a bottom up movement working kind of the lower abs in the best angle to pull from this uh position and of course we rotation going as well a little extra actually we getting a little bottom up rotation at the same time that we the bottom up movement now we seconds she gives us the que for 30 seconds left that means don quit remember just 7 [Music] Minutes last 10 seconds [Music] leg straight windshield wipers two and one drop them down leg straight pull them up down pull them back to the center so what we is we hips and casually let our legs fall left and right like this we want to do is let them drop down and then pull them back to the center by tightening your core you actually do anything but tighten which brings them back to Center [Music] again 30 seconds left it this movement actually teaches us how the core can stabilize peripheral movement right if the legs are moving and I tighten the core they centralize everything which is going to make us more stable and balanced that happens when we perform regular lifts the core is essential to all that I think she said 10 seconds or at least I hope she [Music] did 60 seconds of twisting Pistons right here hop in [Music] come on baby oh there we are waiting for that 30 second count so now tell me how you this for 30 minutes for those that train the ABS 30 minutes at a [Music] time my favorite EXC exercise 30 seconds rest it tells us what starfish crunch oh man this one was tough top down rotation and obliques too because of the rotation that we have rest it up it quick arms out legs out 30 [Music] seconds up rotate and down up [Music] [Applause] rotate 10 seconds tuck plank stay [Music] side tuck this side tuck this side so you too you guys that know that I hate regular static planks there a lot more challenging therefore you get more out of [Music] them 30 [Music] seconds closing in on the 5 minute Mark too [Music] 10 seconds here crunches up and circle all the way down shoulder blades off up both shoulder blades off down this shoulder blade off and around so if you focus on what your shoulder blades are [Music] [Music] doing [Music] [Music] these get [Music] hard all right if that wasn I got to lead this [Music] way that hang again there come [Music] on if it wasn burned so don you feel just focus on finishing this thing out 30 [Music] [Music] seconds 10 seconds oh man oh boy I got a congratulations and everything guys look I of me is falling apart the key Point here is you do not need to spend a long time treading your abs but consistent AB training is key and pairing it up with the right eating is going to help you to see these things 365 days a year the athl next program is about simplifying the process not getting distracted by spending a lot of time doing lot of things that you you don want to make sure you get the results you need to get but quickly and following a scientific approach as always if you workouts you want to follow them yourself day by day they our athletex training systems over at aex.com in the meantime meal plans as well everything if you were able to hang with me for this seven minutes of torture I to hear it and of course even if you didn and curses down below all right guys I [Music] later	Success
Brutal Six Pack Abs Workout (6 MINUTES OF PAIN!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB8Iom51fdA	ATHLEAN - X	what I here but lately I behind the scenes so I figured let keep it rolling here on a washboard Wednesday I want to take you through a real time follow along ab workout that I do every single day or at least it like what I do every single day because you see we have our Shuffle our AB Shuffle feature built into all of our programs when you purchase one of our athletex programs and you go online into your portal we have the ab shuffler here available for you and what it does is it allows you to dictate the level that you could be a rank beginner where you just train a few times per month I train a couple days a week I train four to five days a week or I athleen in this case we guys that we call it max level four to five days a week that you hit that and basically I could choose the equipment that I have available to me at the moment so basically if I look at the equipment I have well let go with a home workout we completely equipment free so here I select no equipment I hit start now brings up a shuffled workout we have a 6 minute and 30 second ab workout here one down two up so we want to look at what they look like before we do them great click on the exercise one down two legs go up one comes down two legs go up it like a heels to the heaven with a little bit more uh difficulty because you have the extra weight of one leg we to do those for 60 seconds twisting Pistons down here on the floor again rotary uh AB movement there reason why these exercises in these categories are in this order because I talk I talk about this sixpack progression that but the idea is there there that you should train your abs in I believe you should start at your lower abs make sure you hit your obliques have bottom up rotation and top down rotation movements mid-range movements well they our shuffled workouts follows that order a hands-free knee tuck okay here more of a mid-range movement just a back and uh and crunch in next starfish crunch arms out legs out right here up and rotate okay so that we got kind of a uh a top down rotation then we have our 9090 crunch just a regular 9090 crunch keep those legs up sometimes you can put a medicine ball up for an extra challenge right up on the end of your uh feet but there no equipment workout here so you don need to and you have one last little 30 second rest period and you come back with the starfish crunch probably one of the hardest ones in this workout for 60 seconds so all you do is you hit start I position over here all these again equipment free I should be able to do them right in that spot right over there so you don start mcing what we get it going but you along with me today require the following pieces of equipment one down two ups for 60 seconds begin in 5 4 3 2 1 so we one down up and one down much different than a regular heels to the [Music] heavens two up and one down [Music] 30 seconds left oh man 30 seconds I hope you these with me cuz we don that [Music] often 10 seconds left 10 seconds remember bottom up movement low R twisting pistons for 60 seconds tting P begin 4 3 2 1 rotational AB movement a little bit explosive [Music] [Music] 30 seconds left halfway [Music] 10 seconds [Music] left 30 seconds rest 30 seconds rest I can use those right about now the rest periods are all determined with an algorithm believe it or not that I spent days and days and days can in to make sure that after a certain combo a certain length of time of exercises that I would give you guys 10 seconds left a designated rest period it that you pick it if you start off a beginner handsfree tucks for 60 seconds hands free tuck 60 seconds 4 3 2 1 my mic just fell off [Music] 30 seconds left [Music] you can see the countdown right there on the screen it just tells you how much you got left 10 seconds [Music] left 4 3 2 starfish crunch for 30 seconds begin at five like out three arms out two one up and rotate up [Music] rotate 10 seconds left [Music] 9090 crunch for 60 seconds begin in five 990 top down movement [Music] 30 seconds [Music] left I am not looking forward to those

NEVER DO PULL-UPS LIKE THIS! | 10 Most Common Mistakes	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K81-SLUFo9c	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com today we pull-ups and my one and only goal for you by the time this video is over is to make sure you right but you I don that you right now or if you do one if you avoid the ten things I showing you here and adopt the alternatives I promise you you more pull-ups starting right away so let your hand placement alright so the first thing you want to make sure you messing up is your grip and I about the width don don people screw this up you want to be right here at about shoulder-width apart if you go in as you see my hands starting to creep in here you dramatically shift the load from the back and the lats to right here the brachioradialis and the forearms which are ill-equipped to handle your bodyweight repetition after repetition in a pull-up when I get my arms in front of my body I a reverse barbell curl except this time instead of curling a barbell up I curling my body up to a bar it doesn matter the muscles recruited are the same and if you get those hands a little bit wider just outside of shoulder width you to do the pull-up and recruit the muscles best equipped to do this job now that being said the brachioradialis is a muscle that is going to participate in the pull-up we just don the primary focus of the pull-up so what I want you to do is stop ignoring the value of this muscle when it comes to performing the overall move right it still needs to be strong we just don want to be the driver of the movement so are you doing enough to strengthen this muscle are you doing enough of these reverse hammer curls really kind of in this pronated position to really recruit those muscles are you doing enough of these to get a stronger form if you not I guarantee you just by incorporating a few sets a week into your normal plan right now you to get stronger brachioradialis and stronger forearms that are going to contribute mightily when you go back to this exercise the key here is not overlooking any of the muscles that participate in the overall performance of the move now this was an interesting one when your hands are up on the bar besides caring about how wide apart they are you also should be caring about how you us will grip and pull straight down what I want you to do is think differently think about how you can pull your hands closer together squeeze them together activate and feel the muscles are your chest engaging because the more activity you can get in your upper body for the pull-up the better you them the more tight you can make your body which is going to happen by squeezing your hands together the better you theme that later in this video but try this take your hands and as you see here try to direct the force inward don it and promise you dramatic increase in how quickly you able to pull yourself up to the bar it gonna feel as if you on air and that because it happens just like that instead of pulling out pull your hands in together and don down in and down is going to be the key our speaking of that total body tightness how tight are you yourself when you do the pull-up I mean are you rigid when you exercise or are your feet looking like this when you of crossing them up letting them dangle down below all of this is no good it counterproductive to your ability to do pull-ups and again these are the things you can fix just like this and how do you fix them you do this you focus on these key points when you position here everything changes you plug what we call the energy leaks and unless you you may not have been doing this and if you have congratulations because I guarantee you pull-ups but it do here is get rid of that looseness because as you direct your force through that bar you that and disperse it out that problem we want to make sure that we not so we create rigidity there so whatever force I direct down can go through the kinetic chain and back up and allow me to move my body very efficiently so I point my feet downward by engaging my calves I straightened out my knees by engaging my quads I squeeze the glutes I have my abs engaged much more than just passively hanging there all of these things allow me to stay tight and as soon as I add tightness to the equation here the body starts to fly up and down a lot easier the process has become more fish and my body moves in space with a lot more power and strength if you do this right now again I promise you you gonna do more pull-ups regardless of how many you effort to protect the integrity of this exercise you probably are I hope are doing full range of motion you allowing yourself to go all the way down so that your elbows actually straighten at the bottom but are you doing this are you unpacking your shoulders are you getting so loose that you can almost touch your biceps to your ears at the bottom because if you are that problem for the long-term health of your shoulder you stability in a very vulnerable position so what I want you to do is fix that make sure that even though you go to full extension that you don unpacked position you allow yourself to create some space by simply pulling your biceps a little bit away from your ears and that will put your shoulders down and back allow for that space between your ears and your shoulder tips and then from here perform every single repetition so go to full extension but don destabilize the shoulder in the process the next thing you might be doing maybe even inverting lee is positioning your elbows in the wrong plane as it relates to your body this way do you have your elbows straight out to the sides because people tell you that if you want to dig your elbows down into your sides to engage your lats or are you doing this instead getting your elbows out in front of your body hopefully it you got to put your elbows out in front of your body it actually is biomechanically more favorable to your ability to do the exercise because you and atomically we know that if we can get the elbow out in front of the body we more stretch than the last and have better recruitment when we need it the most at the bottom of the rep additionally we know that this is something called a scapular plane and in the scapular plane our shoulders just move more naturally instead of fighting that and trying to place your arms back behind your body get them back in the plane that they prefer to be in right here angle slightly forward and your shoulders will feel even better when you do the movement so get those elbows out in front don side unnaturally and I promise not just more pull-ups but more healthy pull-ups for the long run the next one here is a common one very common actually and something we need to pay a lot of attention to because when you do this you take away a lot of the strength you already have making this exercise more difficult when you look like this are you sort of caved in in other words is your chest caved in with your upper back rounded and your elbows out in front yeah your elbows are in a good position like I just told you but are you also allowing the rest of this to cave in because what you should be doing is not doing that you should be allowing yourself to still maintain this natural thoracic extension with my elbows out in front of my body try this little test if you were to go to a lat pulldown and assume this same position that I had up on this pull-up bar you going to find it way more difficult to do the same repetitions with the same weight that you used to using because you taking away all that tightness you taking away the mechanical advantages you thoracic extension so you want to make sure that instead of doing it like this you fix that and you don here on the lat pulldown you fix it back with the pull-up bar the same way get through the bar allow yourselves to get your body angled backwards while maintaining your elbows out in front and this will allow you to pull up this angle to recruit more the back muscles more favorably and again the strength is there you strength because you body in the wrong way the next issue here is one that adopting what I just told you in the last tip and that is we don caved in instead we want to actually be attacking the bar with our chest but I set our chest not like this not our chin how many times do you see people do this they with the goal being just to make sure they get that chin right up to the bar and if they get it they got the rep first of all they inches too short and they reaching with the length of their neck to get that chin up over the bar that not what we the goal so the easy way to fix this is to one attack the bar with your chest like I said at number two use your chest as the goal that through the bar get that chin above the bar it but guess what with the tips you already added here you find this much easier to get your body up there so attack that bar and reach for the bar with your chest that you to actually strive for that to make the overall repetition much easier to get to the full contraction that you right now this one always blowing my mind when it comes to the pull-up and that is why do we always program this exercise differently than the other exercises let single back workout why is it that we do a lat pulldown and then drop the pin down a few place and do a drop set or we fatigued will actually lighten the weight a little bit and do more why don do a certain number of pull-ups and when we fatigue we when fatigued we when we can can actually adopt the same training principles like drop sets by just incorporating something like a band here as soon as I reach failure I could assimilate another drop set like I would on a regular exercise just by stepping into the band getting back up onto the bar and doing more repetitions this is going to improve my overall output over time it repetitions over time it me to get better and stronger at the exercise overtime and overall improve my performance on this lift over time but it requires I not think about it like a different exercise the same parameters that apply to everything else applies here and I want to make sure that you guys understand that and do it and last but not least when it comes to the programming of the pull-up you have to also look at your prioritization of it why do we kind of always stick it at the end of the workout it has the capacity to be one of the best lifts you possibly do especially if you start to add weight as you get stronger it can be one of your best back developers you have so why do we always put it at the end switch it up do something different place it as you the first thing you do in your pull training or in your back day whatever it is you right now warm up with the band get yourself ready to do it but then do it while you remarkable difference in your ability to produce force on this exercise and to get more repetitions on this exercise when you do it fresh versus when you relegate it to the very end get it towards the front of the line instead of always kicking it towards the back you well so they have it guys more pull-ups or in your sight just take note of these ten things these are all things that are easily fixed and fixed quickly I into the big long-term fixes that are going to require you having to reshape your entire way you train right now these are things that any of us no matter how many you can instantly change and even if you just do a couple of them you see more pull ups and your next workout and more importantly gonna start to see more gains from the exercise you gonna actually start to fall in love with it as much as I love this movement now if you where we incorporate pull ups a lot of times because we realized how important they are you can find them all over at athleanx.com in the meantime if you found the video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know so I best to do that for you guys in the days and weeks ahead if you haven done so click subscribe and turn your notifications so you never miss a new video when we put one out alright guys see you soon

The PERFECT Abs Workout (Sets and Reps Included)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk97w6ZmV90	ATHLEAN - X	what athletenext.com today we continue our perfect workout series this time with one of the most requested the perfect ab workout now guys you have to realize that we rectus abdominis when we about an ab workout see a lot of times people use the all-inclusive term of abs to mean much more than that to mean the obliques to mean the transverse abdominis maybe even to mean the serratus because all these muscles matter and they included and worked in our workout here but how are we going to dictate what so perfect guys you know i before there singular perfect workout but we have to include some features to make it a really damn good one and when it comes to the abs it because we know we have literally hundreds if not thousands of opportunities here to pick from different exercises it making sure we hit the main function and to make sure that we actually hit the main sequence of how we want to train these muscles i sequence when you because the bottom up movements tend to be heavier and harder because the weight of your legs is always going to be more difficult than lifting your torso you want to start with those when you have the most energy you that if you save your lower or bottom up movements towards the end you going to get as much out of them so we work in this particular sequence that going to work its way all the way through both variations in this workout that going to include a beginner and a more advanced version of these workouts because i know people are at different levels that want to follow this as a matter of fact to make it even really easy i just a band and a pull-up bar so even if you going to have a hard time following along now guys when we talk about the function the abs do a lot of different things they don that do they think they just crunch but as a matter of fact they actually control motion in the opposite direction they pull you back and control that we want to make sure we work that function if we they also control motion in other directions they prevent us from lateral movement if it and we can work exercises that will do that too they matter of fact we can stay right here in the middle and have someone push our arms left or right and not have them go anywhere and the main function there is going to be attributed to the work of the abs and the obliques we also know that they can control rotation they can let it happen but happen under your control as a matter of fact they can become main drivers of rotation explosive powerful drivers of rotation and any workout that overlooks this aspect of it isn diligence so we want to make sure that we include that function as well we going to include all the proper functions and hit them in the right sequence and go through all the anatomy here so you guys understand what it is you get a peek at the muscles that are doing the job for you so when it comes to the anatomy part guys sometimes it can be confusing but it what we always do with the perfect series and that is break out the muscle markers and as you guys can see here the six-pack muscle the rectus abdominis is pretty identifiable as a matter of fact what i want you to look at though is not just how easily noticed it is but really what is the direction of the fibers and what is it attaching it down north and south attaching the rib cage down to the pelvis driving the movement of flexion of our body top down or bottom up and we know we can take advantage of this motion at the same time realizing that it thing that happens because all you got to do is look at another muscle here like the obliques now if you look at the external obliques which are the visible muscles above the internal obliques you can see that the direction is oriented at an angle at an oblique angle that where i got the name from and the driver of this is that it has a different function it helping us to rotate and control rotation like i talked about so we going to have opportunities to do that if we follow the fibers like always and the internal obliques ironically run at directly the opposite direction but it does the same thing it rotation in another way again working in concert with the obliques on the other side to produce some really magnificent things when it comes to rotation but then we can look at another muscle here and that this one runs more like a weight belt literally around your waist with the idea being this is driving stability we want to take advantage of that because we can do that in certain exercises better than others to really get more out of it and i to do that and then finally guys the forgotten core muscle as i alluded to the serratus the interdigitation that interdigitation of the obliques with the serratus itself is there for a reason there and prefer to work together and if we could do that we will achieve a level of perfection that any other workouts that don so we kicked this off with a bottom-up movement remember we talked about wanting to be doing when we or have more energy so the bottom-up movement will drive this and if you look at the beginner version here we start with the iso reverse crunch with the main function being focused on that pelvis i talked about in the beginning how the attachment of the ribcage to the pelvis means that we bring the pelvis towards the ribcage not get a swing you don you don and up down and up that becomes a hip flexor driven movement if we just isolate the lifting of the pelvis we going to do a better job of hitting the abs and making them do what they supposed to be doing now if we want to make this more difficult we look over here at the advanced side and this is a hanging x-rays the advantage of the hanging x-rays is two-fold number one it lift the weight of our legs as opposed to having a bent leg and number two we period of time than we are when we laying down the strength curve of these exercises are different more prolonged tension on the hanging rays than we would be in any variation of a laying down race and more importantly another thing that we have is this accessory movement of being able to bring the legs together to abduct the legs stabilizing the pelvis from the bottom up with the activation of the adductors so the x-rays allows us to do that so either way guys if you here the perfect beginner workout or if you workout this is where you want to start all right moving on to the next exercise here this is our bottom up rotation movement if you look at the beginner version here guys we have something called a seated ab circle this is an exercise where we actually get some upper body stability because we can keep our hands in contact with the ground which is perfect for more of the beginners doing these workouts we going to just make clockwise circles and counter clockwise circles if you want to make it more difficult here we just step it up a little bit we do these hanging leg spirals again this is like a hanging leg raise which we know are more difficult with the extended length of the legs but we little bit of a hip twist at the end to get that rotation in either case guys what i want you to notice here is the rotational stability function we mentioned in the beginning we trying to prevent rotation here as a matter of fact we anything explosive here with rotation but we are trying to control the amount of rotation we have and once again as we glimpse back we can start to see this ab workout take shape whether it be in the beginner form or in the more advanced form but we hitting both the functions and the sequence that we thing work its best sticking with the rotational theme now we again this is where i like to situate these muscles when it comes to the entirety of the workout if you train the obliques too late once again i feel that you wind up feeling too fatigued to actually do them well so what we want to do here is at the beginner level perform this recliner elbow to knee tuck the main thing to focus on here is the function we we fibers of the obliques remembering that both the internal oblique and the external oblique are going to work together to drive rotation in one direction and the opposite pair are going to drive rotation back in the other direction as we move on to the more difficult version here for the advanced now we called the tornado chop and this is where we band with the hanging pull-up bar because what we want to do here is add some resistance driving the band down into the side again creating rotation the idea being no matter what you do for your obliques guys you better be twisting or moving in some direction left or right if you really want to be hitting them the hardest this is a great opportunity and as we build out these workouts yet again here here this is really starting to take shape all right now we start to move on and start to transition away from all the bottom-up driven movements into some mid-range movement because we involving the bottom up but we combining with some top-down motion and you can see here at the beginner level we opposite side elbow to knee now this is a variation of the plank you guys know that i it comes to using it as just an exercise that can hold the plank for two three four minutes then you enough version of the plank this is the first place that i would have a beginner step up to because what we is challenging some rotational stability of course and that anti-extension component that function of the ab to prevent our low back from caving in when we do lift two points of contact off the ground if we wanna do this the advanced guys we and the bottom up but we them at the same time and we actually add a little bit of a twist to it with this scissor v up here we just trying to keep the leg scissor going and the v up going at the same time this is actually a little bit easier than it looks because the top down motion is going to help to shorten that lever arm of the legs in relation to the torso but don not easy but it is doable especially at this point in the workout and as you see once again we keep building out these workouts here again no matter which one you challenging workout but it will be rewarding i promise and here is actually probably my favorite part of the workout some of my favorite exercise choices occur right here with top down rotation because most of the time they are top down driven with our feet in contact with the ground the first exercise here if you going to work on that anti-rotation component and function of the abs and that is this oak tree step out here you want to get the band out in front of your body extend it as long as you can you can without letting any movement of the arms go back in the opposite direction if you prevent rotation your arms won if you start to see that they drift back towards the anchor point every single time that you either need to lighten the resistance of the band or you need to step out a little bit less now when we move more to the advanced side of it though this gives us a great opportunity to become more explosive here we can actually do something called the sledgehammer swing which is a very explosive rotational ground-based movement again why i love these top-down rotational movements and you can see here i from you can see the pivoting of the foot on the ground to help me to get as much power and force as i can this easily could be a med ball throw against a wall where you can actually express full power because you the ball as i said we just these exercises guys there many options but if you understand the mindset of why we selected what we did here then the opportunities to add different exercises in here will be infinite and now that we fully transition to the top down movements we actually have an exercise in common differentiating only between the beginner and the advanced version by the resistance of the bands you before you think you have to run out and buy a different band you don to wrap it in a different way if i wrap it through itself like this we have the single band that we down on as you see me doing here in the beginner version if i want to make this more difficult all i have to do is wrap it over the bar and then grab one portion of it in each hand and i effectively doubled the resistance by shortening the length of that band but either way guys there want you to focus on in these top-down movements the first one is how we doing it you will not see me doing this i i down towards my heels as a matter of fact if i do this right my pelvis should never go towards my heels we want to do what the anatomy dictates and that is we want to pull the rib cage down and forward towards the pelvis just sitting back in there is actually just cheating your way through every single rep and you it now the second thing you want to focus on is what the transverse abdominis remember i talked about that muscle in the beginning this is a great opportunity and a place to work it and that is can we create some stability of the core bracing if you will before we do that as a matter of fact you tendency to want to drop down into that hip flexor cheat if you do this bracing first and to do that you just want to try to flatten your stomach out what would it feel like if you just walked yourself into an ocean full of ice cold water you because of how cold it is you want to do the same thing here you flatten you tighten you use that internal weight belt to create the stability once it there then you pull down and forward towards that pelvis we are constructing these perfect workouts side to side so you can jump back and forth if need be or follow on one track either way guys you and finally guys where most ab workouts will be over at this point ours is not quite there yet we exercise and that is we want to work the serratus i talked about its involvement and integration with the obliques and why we want to do it as a matter of fact it was part of our holy trinity when we talked about this in a previous video the fact is guys we can do this pretty easily if you to do this exercise here called the plank push away and what we do is we get ourselves once again in that plank position but not to do planks to do something more and that is we to drive our forearms down into the ground get the shoulder blades to be separated start with them pinch together and separate them as far as you can by protracting them by pushing through the forearms into the floor this you will feel will activate the muscles right there in the serratus that will create some stability of the shoulder blades as they relate to your entire rib cage that is important that is a function of core stability so we can work that here and at the same time help to develop the muscles that are going to be clearly visible as they work together with the obliques if we want to make this more difficult we can do this plank punch out as i punch the band out and away from my body it it out in front of you push out in front and then another two or three inches and you the work and there you have it guys the perfect eye workout in the books regardless of whether you the beginner version you see here or the advanced version i in a couple seconds the fact of the matter is guys you have to understand this there is no such thing as perfect we know we can have a lot of other ab exercises that could comprise this workout but when you understand why you to do what you pretty damn close to perfect and this is my best attempt if you programs guys where we do the same thing we try to put the science into the selection of what we do because we know how much it matters all of our programs are based on that same principle they all available over at athletics.com if you workouts guys they you here on this channel you just got to make sure you subscribe and turn your notifications so you never miss one at the same time guys anything you want me to cover i you just got to leave it down in the comments below and i guys in the days and weeks ahead all right

Best Ab Workout Tip Ever (WORKS INSTANTLY!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_TsNeX2IXo	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com I the floor in the middle of my ab workout when I got the idea to shoot this video for you I think the best hands down the best ab workout tip that you might ever come across and the reason why is twofold number one it could be done at home here I am training at home there nothing around me I don elaborate equipment I could do this on any single exercise as you see here soon in secondly it that you could actually do right away as soon as I show you what what the most important thing is so we have to think about one concept that I before and that is when you your workouts it getting from point A to point B it should always be about Contracting the muscle that you you from point A to point B to put a purpose behind what you think there rear is this ugly head than an AB training and it makes a huge difference as to the type of results that you can see from your training so here know a perfect example when we our home RB workouts again we to use a traditional crunch exercise and we know that in order to do a crunch you should get your shoulders up off the ground right if you clear your shoulder blades off the ground you have a posterior tilt going of our um pelvis that we right so we know that this for all intens and purposes would be a well executed rep of a crunch I can tell you that that may look right but there enough effort being done behind that rep to make it that effective over the long term what we have to start doing is really start Contracting the muscles that are supposed to be doing the work for us and that is the ABS and core so look at the difference between the muscularity when we do a well executed rep versus one like I just showed you getting from point A to point B the point A to point B is here and now the one where actually well execute the rep by Contracting our way through looks like this you breathe out contract and come up you can see same thing I off the ground but the degree of contraction and muscularity in here through the core is is Amplified immensely and that after guys you want to make sure that you the work I could do this all day long that work actually much more results uh uh effective that I have to make sure I making the muscles do more work and that favor of rep count intensity same thing can be applied here at home with a reverse crunch again we know that to perform the reverse crunch you got to get your pelvis and hips up off the ground okay as you bring your legs back up towards your head that we want to make it a more effective exercise forget counting forget if we can do 30 or 40 of those and try to focus on the quality of the contraction contaction every single rep contract as hard as you possibly can with the muscles you contract the ABS and come up breathe out and you can not only see the work actually being done but you to see the results of your hard work over time if you start to implement this workout after workout into your ab training guys this is just one of the principles that we talk about all the time of training like an athlete start being in control of your muscles instead of letting your muscles be in control of you it just Coast your way through a workout and work your way through a workout and that of the things I try to teach you in our athletex training system guys there lot of things that go into training like an athlete this is just one of them but I know if you start implementing this right away you Effectiveness out of all your ab workouts and I want you to try it and let me know make sure you leave a comment and thumbs up below and like I said if you want me to coach you through all your all of your workouts not just your ab workouts but every single workout you do then head to athl x.com right now get our athletex training system and allow me to do that i for the opportunity I know I can help you get in the best shape of your life no question about it all right guys I be back here in just a couple days with another new video meantime I get back to my ab workout and get the rest of my work done I back here soon	Success
The TRUTH about Love Handles (How to Get Rid of Them!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VzCnJW1Meg	ATHLEAN - X	love it or hate it can you handle the truth about your love handles today we jeff cavaliere athleanx.com let right into it the truth about love handles write a lot of questions a lot of misconceptions when it comes to training to love handles can we even do it are there exercises that help us to target that area I think all of that needs to be discussed but first and foremost we need to know what it even is what are we talking about when we talking about the love handles well we know that it the pelvis on our side but what is actually going on underneath what that is is it so the external oblique takes up this whole area from right next to the 6-pack area the rectus abdominus this whole big chunk of muscle right up through here is the external oblique now the internal obliques are in there too but they not visible they thing with the transverse abdominus so what we have is a visible external oblique visible rectus abdominus so what we have to do is realize what the function is here the external oblique if I turn this direction you can see that becomes much more visible right as I turn to the left the external oblique on the right becomes visible of course the LAT is here but framing right through here is the external oblique so we want to know we want to work the muscle as you can see also that the direction of the fibers is not straight up and down but it runs on an angle like this okay keep that in mind when we go over a couple of the exercises but first and foremost it does some flexion to the side it does rotation to the opposite side now let what the love handles are not and what you should not be doing about them okay first let talked about the external obliques and how when you look at their orientation that they run like this so then why are we doing weighted side bends to get rid of our vandals right how many guys do you see pick up a dumbbell and do this over and over and over again thinking that because they and yet you can see the obliques working or contracting that they right thing well we know again that they will assist in side bending but what also happening here is you in another muscle the quadratus lumborum one of the lathes back here right around the backside of this it is responsible for hip hiking so we talked about relative motion where they whether we bend from the top down or whether we bend from the bottom up it still going to involve that area and if you keep doing this you aren develop the muscle there to the point where you could thicken the area so if you have any overlying fat at all it gonna get worse you bigger thicker waistline especially those guys that have sort of short torsos right the door to the between the top of the pelvis here and the bottom of the chest if you shorter pelvic I mean a shorter torso it what we want to do is we want to focus on things that work the obliques in the direction that they let me you won this and I that you could do instead okay so let get to what I think we should be doing now I mentioned if you want to work the external oblique all right because we know that is at least the area of the love handles are in it area beneath the love handle then you have to incorporate rotation okay nother side bending crap rotation and what we want to do is if you want to work that right external oblique you rotate left if you want to work to the left external oblique we have to rotate right but what if there can make them work together right do you guys know from following the athlean-x training program or just from watching my videos we like to Train like an athlete an athlete straight on their feet at all costs okay we also like to work muscles together and cross patterns because muscles prefer to work that way so we can get them working the way they want to another bonus so I set up this cable machine here with two of the cables one up here at shoulder level on the right side and one on the left side now before you flip out guys you can do this with a man 2 bands hook them up for less than 20 30 bucks you can do the same thing that this $5,000 machine does okay but what we want to do is grab the cables here and then as you you we going to get that right external oblique and then as we come back we each centrically control that so what great is we got internal and external oblique working at the same time one except eclis one concentrically now is this involving the chest yeah because I through the arm guys we know that you can do a cable crossover right what we want to do is work on using the core to drive the rotation okay see how it gets harder for me to talk because as I really trying to focus on push it with the core and not my arm it gets hard for me to talk okay so we want to work on that of course going to work the other side too but what working the muscle in the way that the fibers before you know in the direction that they prefers to work working both sides together and targeting the area that is over this area that we hate alright the love handles now doing this all day long guys is not going to help as I said diet you got to get your nutrition under way you know under under control we do that in the athleanx training program we have the x-factor meal plan geared at helping you cut body fat

Diet Plan for 6 Pack Abs (STEP BY STEP!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SZ3B3Tqvh4	ATHLEAN - X	what today is going to be a little bit of a rant video but you know what comes with the rant the truth and today the truth about getting abs is always going to reside around your nutrition but the fact is many people will complicate their nutrition unnecessarily along the way whether it be consciously or whether it be a subconscious thing because we want to have something stand in the way of actually doing what we know we need to do together ABS well we don do that I five-step plan for you on how to get your abs to start showing regardless of what you look like now because I can tell you this when I started this very same five-step plan that I share with you here today I didn abs and I had nothing of what what you might see here today but I do know this works because I did use this myself and I know that the Simplicity behind this is the key because if you can something consistently forget about its long-term Effectiveness and that we have to fix okay okay step one are you ready for it cut the crap and I mean this two different ways guys number one cut the crap start being honest with yourself about the foods that you know you shouldn idea about wanting to chase a six-pack which we will put up here as the end goal we know that it that everybody has it requires effort it requires dedication then there are things along the way that you to have to sacrifice and for you to pretend that you don crap is in your diet that you need to cut out that I know that it you want to hear but it that you need to hear and that is you need to start right away by cutting the crap out of your diet and I can tell you first and foremost speaking from experience I was the absolute worst eater on the planet I used to have uh fast food all the time every dinner pretty much I used to eat enem I talked about this before every morning for breakfast Dunkin Donuts for breakfast I used to bring uh Hostess CupCakes ding-dongs ring dings um snowball those were my that was my lunch Otis spunk meire cookies I Brands here but unfortunately I don support them anymore cuz I don of their crap so I got rid of it but you have to do that right now whether it excess alcohol you got to make sure and if you have to question whether it excess it make sure that you get those things out of your diet as soon as you possibly can because you lying to yourself the longer you keep them in there thinking that you to be able to keep them in your diet long term saying long term and still be able to have the six-pack that you want okay now that the crap diet the second phase here is one that actually might shock you because it counterintuitive to what a lot of the keyboard scientists will tell you out there on YouTube and that is you actually should be eating more often you see if you eat more often three things will happen that actually allow you to start seeing that sixpack a little faster number one it thing it you to look at nutrition as fuel instead of looking out nutrition as a reward for being a good boy when you were a kid right you did something good Mommy gave you a chocolate Sunday well that going to happen here anymore guys you got to start looking at food as the fuel to get you through the day at your Peak Performance like an athlete would view would view their food if we can get to that point we next thing that happens is we want to stabilize our blood sugar by eating more frequently now forget about the implications of whether we eat our 42 grams of protein in the morning or we divide it in 21 G at at breakfast and 21 gam at lunch and stuff about how anabolic or not that is guys it probably not going to matter all that much at all there that I talking about the implications on blood sugar stability and how that makes you feel and be feel more energetic throughout the entire day by having a steady blood sugar as opposed to succumbing to the peaks in The Valleys the third thing that happens when we eat more often is we actually then are able to control our portion sizes because if you half to 3 hours what winds up happening is you might not be hungry enough to overeat or crave or indulge something you might not necessarily want to later in the day because you your hunger throughout the day so it for all the reasons that you never are told about it aren it get it to work when we do it long term okay now we three you cut the crap out you more often and now it kind of trips people up the most because they don to go back and take a second pass through that diet and start eating less of the less obvious stuff that good for you and replace it with more of the stuff that you know is good for you and what I mean by that is I back to my experience when I was eating and trying to transition myself to eating better away from all that junk food that I was eating I started to eat uh chicken more often I started to eat oatmeal more more often because I was reading that these were the things I should be eating and I started drinking juice cuz I knew it was healthier than maybe some of the soda that I was drinking in the morning okay that Improvement but it to be if you truly want to get your six-pack to show and to show throughout the year 365 days a year so what you need to do is start looking at those choices again could I make them better and in the terms of chicken yeah I was eating chicken but I was still eating chicken tenders and chicken McNuggets and all kinds of bat Fried Chicken just because you necessarily mean that you right kind of chicken so I educated myself that there are better ways and healthier ways to eat chicken and prepare it which is what I started to do and I started to immediately see differences and gains by doing so so I was encouraged by it the next thing I did again with oatmeal I started to change the way I prepared my oatmeal it was easy enough to make the change and then use the Quaker roots that came out of the packs and say I think I good thing but I felt like it was candy at the same time because I that extra sugar all the extra salt that additives that prepared packets until I made the change to go to whole grain slow cooked oats those were much healthier for you and again when I made that switch I could see the immediate differences and gains in my physique as I was making them so I was encouraged to continue to do them and it wasn eating it wasn eating something I liked to something I didn and I was now used to it and making more uh improvements along the way same thing with juice guys at some point trust me at some point get rid of your sippy cup stop drinking juice and start drinking more water when you when you get to be an adult I don think juice is the best thing in the world for you and it it tends to be loaded with sugar what happens here guys is we tend to drink things in place of what we know we should be drinking more of and that water and there water that you need in your diet especially if you complete physique your muscles thrive on water and everything you drink in place of that is not a substitution for is something exactly that drinking in place so get rid of the juice start making more improvements and refinements on that second go- through in your diet and I promise you you more improvements this is where you see the most but this is where people tend to need the most help because they may not realize some of the things that they great for them okay so you cut out the crap you second pass through that diet to get the less obvious things that are causing a problem and now you something that blow your mind a little bit and that is you Good Foods see you don confusing yourself here guys with your pursuit of abs of just getting abs because you see even Christian Bale and The Machinist here had ABS but it doesn want to look good and build muscle at the same time you support that new muscle growth along the way so the goal here is not just to get abs but to get abs along with building building Le muscle and in order to do that you want to make sure that there sequence we you have to have had already gotten out those bad foods from your diet you have to have already abandoned those cheat days and those childlike needs for rewards of hot flood Sundays because you show up at work on time you gotten rid of that you the second pass through and made sure you a little bit more deceptively undermining your ability to get your abs so now if you locked in on the foods you good job on selecting the proper nutrition to fuel your body well now you want to feed your body and especially if you your body more because that way you muscle growth one of the big things that happens a lot of times when guys go and they make these kinds of radical changes to their eating style is they in a lot fewer calories than they used to because the foods they swapped out were either loaded in fat or loaded in sugar or loaded in lots of extra calories so now they themselves to be very very hypocaloric enough to get as but not enough to support that new muscle growth so you want to make sure that you are supporting it by eating more of these good foods that now exist in your diet primarily and that brings us to our fifth and Final Phase here which is to supplement for consistency guys you hear me say it all the time that consistency here is the key to looking good not just for a few days but to looking good for a lifetime I try to stand in front of you here 365 days a year now for the last six years and not just look good but look better each time I step out at least that what I do is I practice what I preach and by doing so I utilize uh my supplementation here as a very key part of me staying consistent with my meals because I know that we have to have a high focus on the quality of our nutrition everything we just built up to to this Fifth and Final Phase but nutrition can sometimes be difficult to stay consistent with you guys know the challenges I myself know the challenges I travel a lot for my job I may not be within access to all the proper nutrition that I need at any given notice but if I have my supplements and I have my supplementation available I know that I can get what my body needs right then and there in a very convenient travel friendly way so I do that but it doesn you just something that you can take with you that you know you proper nutrients you to your muscles you have everything your body needs and you way that convenient and easy to do and easy to follow it leaves less stress to have to focus on getting all these meals throughout the day to follow the recommendations that I you we also have the added benefit of supplementation providing us with the ability to take our bodies to the next level by delivering things like creatin which we know is a is a highly researched uh uh supplement ergogenic supplement that we know the benefits are proven but we can alone guys I talked about this many many times before those that argue you can get it from a steak get steak every single day do you think that you going to eat steak first of all you may not have the budget for steak every single day and your heart may not like the fact that you every single day what you want to do is get the benefits of creatin without having to have steak every single day and the only way you is by taking in the proper supplementation so there reasons why you want to do that but remember focus on it when you need to focus on it if you 30 40% body fat forget about the supplements at this point and forget about my supplements I tell I tell you that honestly all the time it won matter at that point it won it Titanic if you want to make a difference do the things you know you need to do now start with step one get rid of that crap that what it is if you don I what you need to start doing it that we feel like the need that we have to continue to reward ourselves with the things that make us happy and a lot of times food makes us happy but there lot of other ways to be happy too guys looking in the mirror and loving what you see and liking what what is looking back at you that can make you happy too I promise you and feeling energetic and being able to go out W with your wife and and and feel good standing next to her or be able to take your kids out and not feel like the the dad that has no energy to be able to do something with them that can make you feel great too it can be far more rewarding than that piece of chocolate cake or whatever it is that start getting yourself in line here follow these five simple plans and this five simple step plan and please if you do one thing for me don by the Simplicity of this plan don oh I couldn give me the macros that I needed to get my my abs in in in proper shape the macros guys honestly if I have to hear that one more time I don solving your your problems here you know what your problems are you what they are you got to start implementing them and I be a tough ass here I real the real help that you need the one guy that will come up here and tell you that this is what you truly need to do it have to have the dedication and desire to start making that change all right guys I hope you found this helpful again this is a real plan and this will really work and I know really works because I really did it myself and it took some time but changes minor as they may be over time lead to consistency they lead to your ability to look good all year round if you guys are looking for help along the way with the meal plan head to aex.com get our athletex training system I lay it all out for you meal by meal if you if you remain consistent by delivering proper

Never Do Ab Wheel Rollouts Like This!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3uK5TPzHq8	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com today I want to talk to you all about the AB wheel rollout and more specifically how to nail it every single time because if you don does not belong in your ab training routine for two reasons because at best you and at worst you exercise that can actually cause damage to your lower back but if you do get it right it in your training routine so here you want to do you want to focus on three separate areas one is the setup the second part is the execution and the third part is pulling the wheel back to you those are the three areas obviously every exercise is made up of those three components but in this case people tend to screw up in those three areas so we want to cover all of them so when you getting set up for the exercise the first thing you want to do is focus on the position of your back and your hips and the key here is that you don to follow some advice when people tell you to flatten everything out in one straight line because what you here is you exercise and making it solely one thing and that is for as least as far as the ABS are concerned and that is an anti extension move and while that is a tremendous component of this exercise it into this position here and then you roll out which is what people will advise you to do they letting the lats do all the work while this could be a great lap builder especially if you don options at home that the move we push downs here to build our last what we strength in our core and we know that one of the functions of the core is to flex the spine but it doesn have to get an over flexion of the lumbar spine so watch what I instead I here right where I the upper abs up into my chest that the feeling I want to have and I rounding out the lower back excessively here okay all I into a neutral position from an anterior tilt so now when I want to keep it there so now we go right into the second part and that is the roll out now the roll out what we focusing on here is to go out only as far as you can handle because the main goal here now is to maintain that tightened core prevent a quick fast over extension of the spine because that to do damage to the lumbar spine so when we go out we go out only as far as we can handle beginners might only go out as far as I it the way out as a matter of fact you can even hold it for a short period of time when you so you go out as far as you can handle but the key point is to make sure that at no point do your abs give out and your low back cave-in you want to keep that nice and tight throughout so now here back in what is initiating the pulling if you you established to this point and that what a lot of people do and people will say I if you and your first move is to pull your hips back so that you flexion to drive the wheel back in then you of fact you half the exercise as if the same thing is if you just drop the weights down on a curl and never lifting them what you want to do here is never let the hips lead the way make the wheel and the hips move together now you can test yourself and there you I do I back myself up against the bench and I start by having my butt in contact with the bench as I sit back and then I roll out now if my butt makes any contact with the bench on the way back in I didn my hips dominate and I let it lead the way and we already know that hip flexors are over dominant and a lot of AB movements here this would be just another example of that if we allowed it to happen so instead now when I get away from the bench what you get all the way out there and then I initiate the contraction in the ABS and I pull back in with the wheel and the hips moving together in sync and you see here that when I get to the top my butt is no further back than it was when I started and that is a properly executed AB wheel roll out and that what you should be focused on every single time and guys it rolls over to all of our ab training it trying to crank out reps I think this is where this gets bastardized more than anywhere else in our training is focused on hundreds of reps of ab training no focus on quality reps and forget counting how you that all of your reps count and that is when you abs effectively and more safely if you the science back in strength that make sure that you get not just your ab training right that what every single thing you do then head to athleanx.com right now and get one of our athlean-x training programs in the meantime if you found this video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know us we want me to cover here and I my best to do that for you in the days and weeks ahead remember guys we are trying to do something good for your body the last thing you want to do is something that hurts you as long as you get great results from using this wheel right here all right guys talk to you soon [Music] you	Success
Ab Workout Mistake (BLOATED ABS!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kghVlbG3khs	ATHLEAN - X	what welcome to torso Thursday here at athletex I know another washboard Wednesday a day late but I got to do my best with what we got right so here the deal more importantly I want to help you to solve this problem the problem is is your ab workout making you look fat you see there actually is a way that you should be breathing when you your ab training that will help you to achieve the goal you to in the first place and that is to flatten your belly cinch it down create a tighter narrower looking waist but if you actually going to be doing the exact opposite you towards a distended belly more towards a relaxed belly and you looking towards a fatter looking belly even if you have abs I see guys from time to time that actually have abs that are distended pushed out and it from anabolic steroid use so what I want to do today is teach you how to do that properly but more importantly get you out of that mindset also of thinking that your ab workout can do anything to combat the fat if you see people have this idea that I doing ab workouts you give me all these great ab workouts but I still look fat it belly because no ab workout ever will the consumed energy in an ab workout is minimal maybe 30 40 50 calories You simply not moving enough muscles at a time for a long enough period of time to cause any significant impact in terms of caloric burn so an ab workout alone even if you be enough that is why in our athletex app the six-pack promise it available on Android and on uh iOS we don workout but we give you a sample meal plan as well to help you to start getting rid of some of that overlying fat because it ever going to actually have an impact on the fat there you thicker looking waist and what you should do about it first of all some people will tell you to avoid oblique training because what the obliques will do is thicken your waist and make you look blockier that that worst pieces of advice especially as you conquer your meal plans and start shredding some of that fat because what your obliques are going to do is allow you to have that more tapered look so you can see here that an oblique that developed yes it can cause a little bit of thickness down here that genetics that with but it obliques themselves have def I up above they effect because of the angle that they run so you never want to avoid oblique training if you tapered looking waste you want to make sure you training most importantly with a nutrition plan that allows you to show off the obliques otherwise yes it might look a little blocky but it Justice justifying enough the reason for you to skip doing obliques but as far as breathing goes you want to make sure that you of your ab exercise exer sizes and is this easy no it skill that you might have to acquire but that just like you did when you started riding a bike where you started to practice what it feels like and once you got it right you can ride a bike without even thinking well you want to make sure that you or perform the ab movement so look here on a crunch if I us make the mistake of doing this we crunching up and breathing out at the same time not controlling or even having any mind at all as to what we with our bellies we coming up and blowing out so if you look here we come up we blow out come up and blow out we here without trying to control or actually Engage The transverse abdominus beneath that will hold it and cinch it in you should be doing the exact opposite you should be actually trying to shrink the waist down as you come up it worth the effort if you how to do it and it gets harder the more difficult the exercise becomes you can do it on a hanging leg raise is it harder like I said yes it is but it worth the effort try just to cinch down first as you see me do here and then perform the uh reverse curl here in this case or the reverse leg raise but you want to make sure that you an every single exercise and you holding your breath you can breathe you can talk you can do everything normally you breathing out and cinching in at the same time if you do that you will have a much flatter appearing belly if you don ab work as a matter of fact as your ab work piles up you might start getting that more relaxed and distended look even if your body fat levels are down so what are you going to do what take-home Point take-home point is continue to do your ab training as much as possible I recommend six to seven times a week keep the volume intense but short make sure that you proper nutrition plan we give you all those things in our six-pack promise app again with a sample nutrition plan and then support your overall effort efforts of burning more calories by training more muscles increasing your resting metabolic rate by having more muscle tissue and the only way you do that is by training your body completely so we say it all the time if you want to look like an athlete you got to train like an athlete it doesn mean focusing on your abs yes the ABS in the core are very uh Central to anything in any athletic physique but it doesn end there guys you got your legs you got your upper body you have your whole rest of your body that you have to focus on I actually help you to do that too with our athletex training program we leave no muscle out we leave every even the UN important muscles like the rotator cuff that will help you to pre prevent those upper body and shoulder girl injuries we going to address those too we kind of don aex.com and get that program in the meantime if you found this video helpful make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know what you want to see here whether it be washboard Wednesday or torso Thursday a day late the idea is I want to make sure I cover what it is that you want to see all right guys we soon	Success
7 Core Exercises for Low Back Pain (IMPORTANT!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIhCuqtC0r0	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com so we about mobility lately and this being a washboard Wednesday we about it again but we problems a lot of people will get a lot of times when doing ab exercises and that is they sore in their hip flexors or they low back pain in the common root cause of both of those things is actually possibly your abs you see a lot of times people will look at where the symptom is in treat the symptom ie they your hip flexors out and say god I getting any better or a little stretched your low back out and say god I getting any better but if you want to train like an athlete if you want to look below the surface as a physical therapist that to do in order to earn a living we got to look a little bit deeper we have to find what the root causes and the ABS can absolutely be the cause of both of those issues and a matter of fact they could be playing a large part in creating a vicious cycle to make that problem even worse so how does this all happen well the first thing that we have to understand is that our body really wants to create stability through our spine our spine is the most important structure in our entire body we know that injury to the spine can be debilitating so if our body is out to protect the spine at all costs it stability in the help of other muscles to do that so our abs in our core are one of the biggest areas we have to be able to be able to provide the stability that we need against potential harm to our spine but guess what a lot of us don don other muscle groups and that happens most often in the hip flexors the hip flexors because of their attachment to the lumbar spine they run all the way up through our body and attach to the lower five vertebra of our spine that will provide us with some stability from the bottom up and again through the low back right to our LMR spine so we will get stability of our spine but not with the muscles that we first place so what again stretching the hip flexors no because those hip flexors need to be strong and on a call all day long because your abs aren job so then people finally might get to the bottom of it in their toe to go train their abs what there you start doing ab exercises that contribute more to the problem because 90% of ab exercises especially if done improperly are gonna overwork the hip flexors so I wanted to put together for you here some options that you might have especially if you low back pain or even get those hip flexors on fire all day long here ab exercises that you that will take the hip flexors right out of it and allow you to actually strengthen your abs without further making this problem worse alright take a look at these exercises alright first up is the John to sit up now this is one that we and some of our other videos and this is really a classic example of how we can try to turn the hip flexors off we know that there inhibition that if you contract a muscle on one side of a joint we can actually try to turn off the muscle that opposite side of the joint there easiest example a way to show this is through our bicep if we contract our bicep our tricep has to can relax in order to allow the movement at the joint in this direction same thing here if we contract with our tricep we bicep relaxed to allow the movement in the opposite direction well we know that the hip extensors and the glutes and hamstrings are gonna work together opposite what the hip flexors are trying to do so if we can position yourself like I around a post and contract my hamstrings and glutes right a little bit now we got active contraction on the muscles on the opposite side of the hip flexors that should turn the hip flexors off now we can start doing our crunches so we can actually target the ABS without allowing the hip flexors to dominate next up another one we a lot here lately we call it gymnast abs and you can see you setup here or a captain and all you want to do is support the weight of your body by getting your arms outstretched and locked out it your elbows here we don working the triceps so get your arms locked out use the stability of your shoulders and now all you is just simply lift the pelvis back into a posterior tilt you with your hip flexors you can see it better when you come around the side here I all all I pelvis into a posterior tilt and lift the tailbone up towards the ceiling it very very easy to do and of course it going to work our ABS tremendously without having to incorporate our hip flexor we can use with a band all you got to do is anchor to something sturdy and do the first exercise I which is a pal off press so now we stabilizing on one leg yes we this other leg isometrically holding the hip Flexer up but we real dynamic work there we holding it in position and the real work is being done by the core to try to keep your body upright and stable as I press the band up overhead again not actively involving the hip flexors in the movement just for the positioning here of the exercise we can move and become a little bit more dynamic by doing the sledgehammer swings now we actively twist and turn our torso in the opposite direction of the band obviously step out further you get more resistance we here we in control of rotation but our feet are planted firmly on the ground there active contribution here of the hip flexors at least dynamically again stabilizing from below but not dynamically working as they do in some other exercises finally we move on here to the jump out variation of this which is just a little bit more dynamic and explosive and the same thing applies you front of your body you anti rotation ability of your core you landing without allowing the band to pull you back yes you to go back it back because it your abs but again you hip flexors out of it and next we have an exercise a lot of people don associate necessarily with the core exercise but it absolutely is yeah it going to work your forearm and grip strength too which is a bonus but the thing here that we focus on is controlling the stability of your core remember it stabilizing your spine there better here than a suitcase carry here I and I shoulders as I possibly can do so I trying to walk here towards the camera and then get away from you the goal here is to try to keep my shoulders level I got a hundred pounds weighing me down on one side it becomes a bit of a challenge but the only thing we help us will be our spinal erectors in our core in front our ABS in front and trying to pull us upright and maintain that upright position obviously the heavier weight you use here the more of a challenge and finally we have a side plank leg lift once again we flexors here in the sagittal plane we working a frontal plane motion here that allows us to get our stabilizers working tremendously hitting them from a different angle and now we get into a side plank that could be enough for most of you but if you want to really add a challenge try to lift your leg up here as you that will actually make it much harder for me because now I ability to push through into the floor with two feet and two legs but really just with that bottom leg which makes it all that much more demanding for that lateral pillar strength on that bottom side so there you have it guys there are some ways for you to start training your abs especially if you suffering from some of this low back pain when you or you through your low back every time you try to do more traditional ab exercises and again I think it underscores a very important point when it comes to mobility don people say oh my hip flexor is tight stretch it no that to do you got to look a little bit deeper maybe you have to start looking at muscles that are weak and that those other muscles are kicking in and doing their job for them so there one common answer for every single thing when it comes to mobility you got to be a little bit more specific about that hopefully through these videos you starting to see that if you guys want to start training with a system that uncovers and peels back some of the layers we don stuff to give you everything else that everybody else is already giving you we try to help you train a little bit more scientifically but at the same time a lot more productively that athlean-x is all about if you for that training program that will do that head to athleanx.com right now and get our athleanx training system if you found this video helpful if you like these washboard Wednesday

Best LOWER ABS Exercise YouÂve NEVER Tried!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejNkNHes4LY	ATHLEAN - X	what athletenext.com so today i something different here i promise you an ab exercise in particular for the lower abs you i that i think what i here today is actually going to be the best lower ab exercise you lot of reasons because it able to challenge and help a lot of different people no matter what ability level you when we to pick some movement that moves the pelvis up towards the shoulders curls from the bottom up and we might try lots of different exercises to do this like hanging ab exercises hanging knee raises hanging leg raises right but there problem with these exercises a couple actually number one beginners sometimes find it very challenging to hang out and hold themselves up on the bar for a meaningful amount of time to be able to get enough reps in to challenge themselves the second thing is these exercises if not cued properly can become over reliant on the hip flexors to do the movement and i before the key in showing your ass meaning to show your ass and curl your pelvis up while you do these exercises but sometimes because of weakness in the lower abs people aren and they tend to just use the hip flexors to lift the legs we could also do a ton of exercises on the ground to hit the lower abs with the same concept being pull the legs up or move the pelvis backwards but again the same things apply here too and that you actually using your hip flexors far too much shutting down the lower ab activation and defeating the entire purpose but what we can do is we can do this exercise right here and this we call a screwdriver now guys you set yourself up into a dip station and the key here to this exercise is you really don curling the pelvis up and this makes it a lot more tolerable for beginners because all you have to do is learn how to posteriorly tilt and lift yourself up now for those who watched this channel for any length of time you say what but jeff that gymnast ab exercise and i have tried it before because i well it different because all you have to do now is you hold yourself in this position which by the way is a lot easier and it have any kind of shoulder problems because this compression of the joint actually provides more stability in the shoulder than that distraction does when you hang from a bar so it actually is a lot easier so what we do for the exercise is we come down and we screw drive ourselves down to the ground and we pull up and then down and pull up and you elbows relatively straight so that all the work is being done by the abs and the obliques and that of those extra added benefits here why i love it so much is that anytime we can take muscles that prefer to work together and get them to work together like the abs and obliques then we got a winner and we just do this for time okay the other benefit to this and why i really like this is what happens when we have an over reliance on those hip flexors we tend to get tight hip flexors which will cause low back pain so anybody that gets low back pain from doing ab exercises kind of runs out of options and things to do to hit your lower abs this actually gives us an opposite effect we get decompression of the spine because once we let our arms post us up here and then we let our pelvis drop we have a decompression of the spine you can literally feel your pelvis drop and open up some nice room in your low back so it should feel pretty good in terms of that it so from there again just as up and down and that and again i actually have had to move to these kind of exercises over the years because of the issue i had with my shoulder and i found that the added benefits of getting that compression were helping that out and at the same time working together in a way that hasn one a try guys the screwdriver i promise you even the beginners can do this as long as you can hold yourself up which shouldn work because you don with bent doubles the whole time let your joints sort of hold you up there it promise if you that puts the science back in strength has lots of criteria of how we arrive at the exercises that we use in our program because they have to work and they have to be safe we have them all put together for you already in our step-by-step program that meantime if you found the video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know what else you want me to cover i in the days and weeks ahead see you soon	Success
I Did the ÂBaby Shark Ab WorkoutÂ for 30 Days (THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4aPUBgmG_o	ATHLEAN - X	you start talking or what oh the video is running i talking yeah i don with this video why not do you want to explain what you were doing when i walked in on you earlier today i have no idea what you about oh no no this [Music] okay that i can explain i i really hope so okay first off that was the 30th day of me doing the baby shark ab challenge the what the baby shark ab challenge that so did you explain what yeah absolutely i can absolutely explain that so about a month ago i was at a party having fun unlike jeff because you know by the way train like an athlete baby shark go ahead yes yes okay um i was at a party i had was over served with few alcoholic beverages again i have yes a few okay i have fun two dozen uh my friends challenged me to a game of beer pong and they said if i lose because i work at a fitness company you still work at a fitness company that discussion we video they said if i lose i have to do the baby shark ab challenge for 30 days needless to say i lost but if you because i think my eight pack pretty sweet eight that there you counted them in video so mr six-pack all right so let me get this straight so do you wanna take them through the same exact workout yes absolutely that this video is i wanna take you guys through the exact same workout that i did for 30 days it actually works yes 100 take a look oh god here we go again all right i it you show them and i i jeff do you want to join with us no i good seriously you enjoy your six pack we enjoy our eight packs [Music] mommy [Music] oh this one sucks [Music] hey you know what this is awesome and guess who i saw doing this the washington nationals so you know what don they this is basically a dance [Music] we [Music] all right so maybe a little bit of redemption on your part guys i honest here i didn this but i will tell you this hold on a couple things number one consistency i say that the best way to train abs is to train them daily if you train them daily in a short period of time you number one that number two the fact that you were under constant tension the entire time even though you were in your rest period you were still in that basically have visit that condense these exercises together the third thing is that you using time as your training variable as opposed to reps a lot of times people will program wrapped ab workouts 10 reps of this 15 reps of that the problem is 15 reps may not be anywhere near as difficult as it should be for you versus somebody else so if you do time time is actually something that can actually become a lot more of an equalizer speaking of time i want to throw a little thing out there guys um this is a short workout it minutes if it what i did as i progressed was just repeat it you just keep going to get it more intense and you know make it more difficult for yourself as you that constant tension going for a longer time right and that point for progression the last thing is it is always a lot easier to train to music and we talked about a whole video about why music is helpful because you wind up almost focusing less on what you out and the burn that you might be feeling and you get more of uh you just keep going i doing that i here though jesse the fact is you probably could have chosen something a hell of a lot cooler well like iron maiden anything and you probably could have just done like one of the ab workouts on the six-pack promise like it would have been a lot easier because we do time dab workouts their exercises are flowing with the right difficulty level it would have been a hell of a lot you would have saved a lot of face as opposed to having done this for 30 days but congratulations nice job well i this though your six-pack promise doesn there you go guys if you the six-pack promise actually it the app store in the meantime if you looking for science-based training not this but science-based training we have it all over at athletnext.com guys i hope you found the video helpful make sure you try it actually is pretty damn difficult yeah give it a try in the meantime if you videos here make sure you click subscribe and turn on notifications so you never miss when we put one out and i days see ya see ya [Music]	Success
4 Steps to Awesome LOWER ABS! (Works Every Time)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpnB7x7OjCM	ATHLEAN - X	what athletenext.com today we about the lower abs definitely the area that guys tend to really want to have they don if they want to have the six pack you gonna have to have your lower abs show as well but i will tell you this it not as easy as it sounds especially when you look at the fact that a lot of us are being fed misinformation and i want to clear that up today because i followed the same misinformation i learned a lot over the years as i went to school and became a professional and started training people i realized our abs actually a little bit different than we might have thought they were and i suffered from not having the right information so we all up today all right and we to cover four myths in the process and tell you how you can overcome them and get it right first and foremost we got to talk about nutrition when you looking to to get a six-pack and most importantly your lower abs there myth out there that just having a decent diet is good enough guys i tell you this if you have a decent diet you of your abs right there maybe the top two and the rest of it pretty flat but if you want to get the middle abs to show you get a little bit more serious about your nutrition you start finding a good diet but i tell you this right now no bs if you want to have your lower abs show you going to have to have a great diet and that means you a solid nutrition plan that you are very consistent with and i here and say which one is exactly the perfect nutrition plan because there lot of people that will swear by the way they eat and how it works for them and that so if you have a plan that allows you to eat foods that you actually enjoy and you can stay consistent with then yes it will help you to get that six-pack and actually keep it and for me that it all matters it comes down to the fact that you but you relies on longevity and consistency and most importantly on a really dialed in nutrition plan number two my approach to app training changed over the years because i thought that all lab training was app training right there was a point where i actually thought sit-ups was all we needed to do and a lot of people actually approached rap training that way i amount of sit-ups every single day sips alone a top-down movement are not going to cut it if you really want to get your lower abs to show then you have to start to train them a little bit differently meaning with bottom up movements now why is that because we know that the science of it that the rectus abdominis is one muscle that contracts all or none no matter how we move it from the top down to the bottom up but here move from the bottom up you your legs along with your pelvis and that immediately makes the exercise become more of a weighted ab exercise it is a loaded exercise and we know how much more difficult it is to do lower ab movements moving the legs on our upper body by either hanging or doing them on the ground like you see me doing throughout these variations of clips here that is it fibers more than it is the type 1 fibers in your abs and that adding an overload so when you say that you don the lower ab movements themselves by virtue of having to carry the extra load are going to activate different fibers and even the angle of the activation is different because of this bottom up approach versus top down so you can just think regular strips are enough you got to start incorporating specific lower ab movements if you really want to get your lower abs to pop which leads us to the third area here that you to have to tighten up and that is how you movements you see because i just talked about the value of using those legs for the added resistance here and what impact that has on your lower ab training but the thing is don the fact that just because your legs are moving that you abs as a matter of fact i would argue that the biggest mistake i made throughout a lot of my early years of ab training is that all i did was swing my legs and activate my hip flexors and let everything else go along for the ride what you want to do instead is let the pelvis take the legs along for the ride during all of your activities so here the difference if you see me on the ground here this is a version where i literally just pulling my legs straight up but you activity of the pelvis and we know if we want to contract the abs what we need to do is we need to take the pelvis and turn it into a posterior tilt we need to get it off the ground and rolled back so if i work am i really doing with my abs very little so instead what i is focus solely on what your pelvis take it down until it contact with the ground and then initiate the moves that the pelvis is coming off the floor first regardless the legs are going to come along for the ride they so they have to make sure that you focusing on just moving your legs and no matter what exercise you if you see me here the action is always happening at the pelvis forget the legs guys use the pelvis as your moving point and focus on what it necessarily what your legs are doing and last but not least guys we have to change our conception of what core training is people always say i training my core really what they doing is they there just your abs but when we talk about the lower abs we have to expand a little bit lower and what i we pelvis and we realize the importance the pelvis has on lower ab training because of the attachments of the rectus right into the pelvis then we also have to realize well other muscles actually attach to the pelvis from below so involving them or contracting them is going to have an impact on that very same pelvis that we moving with our lower ab movement so there adductors are one of the key areas you want to do that with so when i approach any lower ab movement if it provides the opportunity for me to do so then what i want you to do as well is to start crossing your legs and at least squeezing your adductors what that does is it creates stability of the pelvis from below and anytime we want to generate force from above if we have a stable base from down below we to be able to do that better it same idea i always talk about if we going to try to jump and i gave you one opportunity to jump as high as you possibly could would you rather jump off of this solid box right here would you rather jump off a sand if you tried to jump off a sand when you tried to exert force and push down all that force would be dispersed into the sand right no stability from below if you try to push off of this box all that stability is going to provide you the opportunity to jump your highest the same thing happens when we do our ab training if i to generate force and tension from above with the rectus feeding down into the pelvis and i could grab and tighten the pelvis from below because the adductors now i a better opportunity to do that so guys any opportunity you have whether it be a hanging leg exercise here or a leg exercise done on the ground if you can squeeze your legs together and push and squeeze at those adductors you to get much more activation out of your lower abs with every single rep and at the end of the day that the most so there you have it guys hopefully lessons learned here so that you don and a lot of times guys it mistakes it fed we simply take it and run with it and when we get frustrated when it working we always sort of sometimes blame ourselves well i you that i made the same mistakes myself guys and i the years really perfected what it is we do here to the point where we say we put the science back in strength and incorporate it into all of our programs it they do it effective as they have because we put that science back in what we do hopefully these are just four examples that you can take right now incorporate into your lower ab training and start seeing better results if you for a step-by-step program guys head to athlanex.com get one of our athletics training programs in the meantime if you found this video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know what else you want me to cover and i do my best to do that for you in the days and weeks ahead all right guys see you soon [Music]	Success

How to Target Your Lower Abs (MAKE THEM VISIBLE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVgPzOqaLO8	ATHLEAN - X	So, do you have a two pack or maybe even\\xa0\\na four pack, but no matter what you do,\\xa0\\xa0 your lower abdominal region just looks like\\xa0\\ncrap? Well, guess what, you can do something\\xa0\\xa0 about it today, you can actually target this area\\xa0\\neffectively if you use the right exercises. You\\xa0\\xa0 see, lucky for us, a lot of research has been done\\xa0\\nthat actually shows that you can more favorably\\xa0\\xa0 activate the lower abdominal fibers over the upper\\xa0\\nabdominal fibers based upon the exercises that\\xa0\\xa0 you than the top down. When you start to initiate an\\xa0\\nab exercise like a crunch that starts from the\\xa0\\xa0 top, moving your chest down towards your\\xa0\\npelvis, that But on the other hand, if you can choose\\xa0\\nexercises that start by moving your lower\\xa0\\xa0 half up towards your chest, that initiate that contraction so we can do something\\xa0\\nabout it. But now, because I care about you,\\xa0\\xa0 we where I tell you there are limits to your ability\\xa0\\nto target. While the exercises that you choose can\\xa0\\xa0 more effectively target the lower abdominal\\xa0\\nregion, you these exercises to target a specific area of fat.\\xa0\\nYou know, the one that you no matter which exercises you you Now that being said, can we talk about\\xa0\\nthe exercises? Because if you do these,\\xa0\\xa0 they you you get right. The first thing is you is creating a posterior pelvic tilt, which is\\xa0\\ngoing to activate those lower abdominal muscles.\\xa0\\xa0 If you have the ability to slide your hands\\xa0\\nunder your back, you anterior tilt and you goal should be to not be able to fit your hands\\xa0\\nunder your back if you The second thing you need to do is\\xa0\\nset the angle of your legs. Ideally,\\xa0\\xa0 you could do this with a 90-degree bend of\\xa0\\nyour knees in a 90-degree bend at your hips.\\xa0\\xa0 Now, if you want to make this a little bit more\\xa0\\nchallenging, you would just simply extend the legs\\xa0\\xa0 a little bit further out so you have more weight\\xa0\\nto lift or you just bring your knees a little bit\\xa0\\xa0 closer to your chest. But the key is once you\\xa0\\nestablish whatever angle you you need to keep it there and then move the\\xa0\\npelvis and the legs together as one unit.\\n\\xa0 You see a lot of people do this wrong. They just\\xa0\\nsimply start to swing their legs up and down\\xa0\\xa0 and all they role of the abdominal muscles. You want to be\\xa0\\nable to curl the pelvis back towards your chest\\xa0\\xa0 and let the legs go along for the ride. And\\xa0\\nnot just have the legs drive up and down,\\xa0\\xa0 which over activates that hip flexor and can\\xa0\\noftentimes lead to back pain. Now, the variation I\\xa0\\xa0 like to use on this exercise is one that actually\\xa0\\ngives you some feedback to let you know you doing it right. And we call it the Swiper. \\nSo, all you have to do is set that angle, again,\\xa0\\xa0 based on your ability level and then move the\\xa0\\npelvis backwards towards your head. And you want\\xa0\\xa0 to be able to do it long enough that you can swipe\\xa0\\nyour hands underneath, touch each other, and come\\xa0\\xa0 back out to your sides. This is going to delay\\xa0\\nthe time that it takes you to do the exercise,\\xa0\\xa0 increasing the time under tension and\\xa0\\nmaking those muscles work even harder\\xa0\\xa0 if you try to deliberate a little bit more by going\\xa0\\nslower and making your abs do more work.\\n\\xa0 Exercise number two is another one you\\xa0\\nprobably tried before, maybe done a lot of,\\xa0\\xa0 but not like this. And that but you want to think of them differently because\\xa0\\nyou your chest. Instead, think of it like you and the knees should go much higher. Try to think\\xa0\\nof them going almost as high as your forehead,\\xa0\\xa0 even if they can because that the exercise becomes a lot more effective. \\n\\xa0 If you don you but not help you to target the lower abs like\\xa0\\nyou rep and I promise you better results will come.\\xa0\\nAnd speaking of results, if you haven Athleanx.com yet, what are you waiting for? We\\xa0\\nactually have a step-by-step plans and all you\\xa0\\xa0 have to do is take our quick program selector\\xa0\\nand I your goals. Now, back to the exercises. \\nYou Oh. And that exercise number three is a variation\\xa0\\nof a Plank. You guys know how I feel about\\xa0\\xa0 traditional standard planks. But this is\\xa0\\nway better because it and it the get-go here is that I my knee in towards my elbow, but then I slide it\\xa0\\nup because as I do that, it pelvis into that natural posterior tilt. Again,\\xa0\\nactually engaging those lower ab fibers. \\n\\xa0 And if you All you have to do is just slow it down. If you\\xa0\\ngo slower here, you muscles doing the work. And ultimately that of a challenge, then maybe you don Instead, what you can do is just pop yourself up\\xa0\\nonto a bar because the bar gives you a chance to\\xa0\\xa0 do the same thing with a Hanging Leg Raise. But\\xa0\\nnothing changes, you still have to establish\\xa0\\xa0 that posterior pelvic tilt and you still want to\\xa0\\ntry to bring your pelvis up as you do the exercise\\xa0\\xa0 along with your legs. But the difference here\\xa0\\nis that the changing body position effectively\\xa0\\xa0 increases the weight of your legs because you\\xa0\\nhave to now lift them fully against gravity,\\xa0\\xa0 almost for the duration of the entire exercise.\\nOn the floor, that Regardless, incorporating the same three\\xa0\\nprinciples we talked about in the beginning\\xa0\\xa0 is going to make this exercise a lot more\\xa0\\neffective than just simply flipping your legs\\xa0\\xa0 up and down without ever focusing on what Jeff, what are you still doing carrying that\\xa0\\ndamn muscle marker around? It s because I m\\xa0\\xa0 not done yet. You see, there actually get more out of the same exercises\\xa0\\nI just showed you. And that engaging the adductors. Because we know if we just\\xa0\\nsqueeze our knees together, which is easily done\\xa0\\xa0 on three of the four exercises that we can\\xa0\\nengage and stabilize the pelvis from below,\\xa0\\xa0 allowing for a stronger contraction of the lower\\xa0\\nabdominal muscles. So, if you take that Swiper and\\xa0\\xa0 you squeeze your knees together the whole time,\\xa0\\nthe adductors will be easily engaged. If you\\xa0\\xa0 take that Reverse Tailbone Lift again, squeezing\\xa0\\nthe knees is very easily accomplished and added.\\xa0\\xa0 And if you go to that Hanging Leg Raise, the same\\xa0\\nthing can be applied here too each time, allowing\\xa0\\xa0 you to feel the exercise even more. If you do\\xa0\\nthe Plank Knee Slide, two things should happen,\\xa0\\xa0 the back foot that stays on the ground, you\\xa0\\nshould almost feel like you inward to engage the adductor on that side. \\nAnd then you take the other leg that towards your elbow, and you actually bring it a\\xa0\\nlittle bit inward. And even if you want to take\\xa0\\xa0 another step further, you do the second thing, and\\xa0\\nthat is you add a little bit of rotation. Because\\xa0\\xa0 as you as they taper down towards the pelvis. Which means\\xa0\\nthey you can take that Plank Knee Slide and go towards\\xa0\\nthe opposite elbow to get some of that rotation.\\xa0\\xa0 But again, on the Swiper, no one says you have to\\xa0\\nbring it straight back, go a little bit towards\\xa0\\xa0 the right shoulder and a little bit towards\\xa0\\nthe left shoulder on alternating reps. \\n\\xa0 And also, on that Tailbone Lift go a little bit\\xa0\\ntowards the right shoulder or a little bit towards\\xa0\\xa0 the left shoulder. Just a little bit of rotation\\xa0\\ncan be introduced even here on the Hanging Leg\\xa0\\xa0 Raise to introduce more of that lower ab fiber\\xa0\\nengagement. Remember, guys, I say it all the time,\\xa0\\xa0 follow the fibers, whatever the direction they\\xa0\\nrun in, that And that But I promise you that nutrition piece, because\\xa0\\nno matter how many times you do these exercises\\xa0\\xa0 or how many reps you do, you get rid of it. As a matter of fact, it for that matter, lose weight. They go from\\xa0\\nthe head to the toes and the toes to the head,\\xa0\\xa0 and they kind of meet in the middle, which\\xa0\\nmeans that as they drop body fat and their\\xa0\\xa0 face and their neck and their upper chest or\\xa0\\ntheir lower legs and then to their thighs,\\xa0\\xa0 what oftentimes remains, is that lower\\xa0\\nabdominal fat. It So you And while you make it unenjoyable. Guys, I have a whole day of\\xa0\\neating that I put together where I show you, you\\xa0\\xa0 can eat carbs and actually eat enjoyable\\xa0\\nfoods.

How to Get a Six Pack - ULTIMATE STEP BY STEP GUIDE!!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AjdUpUpWXc	ATHLEAN - X	are you tired of hearing about shortcuts to six-pack abs and guys I pull up a chair I I to get a six-pack regardless of what body fat level you [Music] what athleanx.com so you step-by-step way to get to a six-pack and you haven truthful information out there that going to get you there so what I wanted to do here at athlean-x was put together a video where we specifically addressed how to get to a six-pack depending upon the body fat level that you there of body fat levels that we can have in the path to a six-pack is gonna be greatly different depending upon where you are right now so what I do is cover all the different ranges of my fat and tell you specifically what your path should be what you should focus on and what you should ignore so you can find that helpful video that you we with our first group are 30 to 40 percent body fat level okay first up 30 to 40 percent body fat and know guys I saying body fat and not body weight because there will be some guys that are going to step on the field this weekend in the NFL playoffs that are close to 300 pounds that are almost sporting six-pack ABS because these guys are just complete beasts in terms of their physical development they are not fat just because they weigh a lot these are big men that have a lot of muscle so you have to be careful when you distinguish but that being said this right here is what a guy at thirty to forty percent body fat would look like so if you can identify with this your tackk plan is as follows you want to focus 90% of your efforts on changing your nutrition habits okay and two things in particular you want to make sure you small changes small changes made over the course of time right then take you a day to get this to this point guy so it get out of it so you want to make small changes and try to simplify your meal plan choices take five breakfast --is that you actually enjoy eating and then rotate through those that breakfast options to last you for many many many weeks without becoming bored or stale because a lot of guys want of repeating the same meals anyway each and every day secondly supplementation do you need supplements at this point my answer is no you minutia when you should be focusing on again change your overall dietary habits and at this point supplements are kind of a waste why because what much of happening is these guys think that all I more lacks on my diet here and that not that that fact I tell guys I don order for athlean RX supplements if you the wrong thing first let nutrition and order we can worry about the supplementation later and we about that as we get down into the other groups thirdly conditioning conditioning is important guys you gotta get your body moving you have to establish with caloric deficit one of the best ways to do that is just through conditioning however you know how I feel about steady-state cardio and I feel that even here in early introduction to high-intensity interval training without the high intensity is the best way to go so if your interval is even a 2 mile per hour slow walk with a 4 and a half mile per hour slow jog if that handle at the moment that handle you can work yourself up but I do think that incorporating intervals into your conditioning is key finally smart strength training yes it be in the gym but you guys know you seen this guy before in the gym he one that winds up hurting himself he the one that uses terrible form push down on that kind of thing or the one doing crunches and pulling on his head he things he thinks he unfortunately at this weight and at this level of conditioning he winds up hurting himself and not coming back to the gym at all ok if you are a former athlete who has had experience training let yourself go you might find that you can bounce back quicker to the more standard training styles but for me I think let others would recommend somebody some workout magazines might say I them bottom a program for a beginner by the way program for a guy that weighs almost 300 pounds of body weight programs gonna be pretty damn hard especially you telling you have to start doing some pull-ups so what you want to do is have smart recommendations it might be that you ball wall squats because you can perfect the depth you can perfect the form you can get your body moving you work on the bigger movement so you can burn more calories but overall guys you just want to get the basics you want to get yourself going ok you will work yourself down from this group all the way down to where we but the focus has to be in the right place and that right now guys in this thirty to forty percent range a quick little inspiration for you if you find yourselves here look no further than this guy right here Jack Elvin this is a guy that sent his pictures in just the other day and an absolute inspiration to me makes me know that what I making these videos for you if it makes it all worth it this guy changed his life he changed his physique he used to be a guy in this bracket he clearly does not anymore and you do the same thing but again let in small steps focus on what you need to focus on and let now right down to the next range twenty to thirty percent alright guys next up twenty to thirty percent body fat this here is an image of what a typical person would look like in this twenty to thirty percent range now what does the focus still guys common theme majority of it should be on nutrition okay at this point supplementation though can become a little bit of a factor why because as you start to become more dialed in on your nutrition you will find that supplementation allows you to become a lot more consistent and reliable in terms of the choices that you right you know what you you guys you and you those nutrients so you basically get more reliable nutrition as an option but should not be your sole source of nutrition you still want to be in graining the right nutrition habits here because they through all the way down to that sub 10 level as far as your ab repertoire right we didn exercises in the first group because I didn you abs to be worrying about them at that point however in this case here we want start increase in the ad work before we want to start doing the basic ab exercises you want to start doing planks why don crunches work guys they flex the spine as one of the key roles of the spine but we don you want to start doing some standing rotational work okay with light tubing or with cables just to get your abs working properly you don doing all these complicated variations of exercise as a matter of fact a lot of guys you can thumb up below if it will find that when doing certain reverse crunching movements in this body fat range you get lower back pain why is that it decondition and not strong enough to handle the loads of your lower body in those reverse crunching movements or hanging movement so you got to pick and choose in most of all I think find the benefit in focusing on core engagement on all of your big lifts this is something I at athlean-x when you ventricular be aware of it try to hold it and activate it throughout the rep so that you have that stability carrying through that towards helping you build that foundation for your six-pack as you continue to strip away this body fat and in terms of your conditioning you still want to be improving your intervals at this point we interval training here so you want to start to improve those intervals if you were doing two mile and four mile you going to be doing four and six miles an hour miles an hour okay try to gradually improve your conditioning as you can so you can continue to use that as a source of burning fat burning calories to establish that caloric deficit but this here guys this is your game plan for getting out of this zone and down into the next one all right guys moving on the next rule Group right here fifteen to twenty percent body fat what I call no-man land lies because where most guys get stuck on their way to their six-pack abs this is what I the 15 to 20 percent guy okay if you look like this you might be able to relate to the fact that you like this for quite a while because this is a hard realm to get out of because it requires the most consistency you already done a good job if you this range guys you put yourself in a range that than the average guy because the average guy is going to fall higher than this unfortunately but it consistent dedicated effort to get yourself out of here but I gotta give you some encouragement it easiest places to get out of if you do it right here order to get out of no-man have to be consistent like I said that requires variation in your training don and over again your mind will get still your muscles will get used to it you gonna wind up being here because as I say if you keep doing what you doing you you tax of DVD programs before I think they contribute to a lot of this happening because they basically tell you to keep doing the same exact workout over and over again no variation on exercise no variation on intensity listening to the same guy over and over again it gets boring okay so what you want to do is vary that you want to have consistent progression here here you here on your conditioning a little bit more effort all these things are going to add up because as you start to push and they see changes they should inspire you mentally to be able to push further because once you get through here the rest is easy guys we put abs in every single exercise now this is where our athleanx guys come in all the time this is where a lot of our guys that come to us for athlean-x are there in this zone they they can program we get them through because we start putting ads in every single exercise by doing exactly what we shown you here on this channel for many many years now intensity again without annihilation you want to push yourself as hard as you can you don annihilate and start overtraining you very real yes it does happen to keep a lot of guys in this realm one may succumb to it finally supplementation a good thing here again it continue your efforts of your good nutrition it it okay so everything comes down to consistency here and supplementation gives you that edge in this point for our recovery from our hard workout so if you are leaving it all out there the supplementation the right kind of supplementation will help you to recover from those hard workouts so you can continue to repeat it and be consistent okay so that is your goal here remain consistent do everything you can have exercise again the repertoire increases again you should have a little less back pain if you were the guy that did have back pain in the 20% range because your abs should be stronger you should be able to tolerate more of an increase repertoire especially with some of the lower by a lower curling for the lower body up especially on like a hanging bar the more difficult ab exercises are well within your range to do okay guys this is where it starts to get good this is the 10% body fat range right here this is what we about okay definitely you abs at this point but you think you could do a little bit more you think there and that right if your goals are to get a really ripped six-pack then you to get lower than 10% body fat but here techniques right abs in the right light is what I say this is the guy that says I can see them when I all shadows but when I go out in the daylight nobody can see my abs anymore if I get to the beach right what we have to focus here on guys is fine tuning and at this point when we talk about nutrition I say here cheat meals not days all right I don cheat days guys I really don it talking about playing darts anybody can play darts all I have to do is set up a board and be able to hit the board right I the wall and come close to big people around them they players they probably shouldn playing but the guys that can play darts you board if you just want to be an average dart player but if you want to win at darts you got to hit the bull when you want to start getting some 10% body fat you guys better be willing to hit the bull and that is where I say cheat meals not days and even your meals you want to try to keep them to a minimum if you eating five to six times a day you looking at 35 to 40 meals a week try to slip up on only a couple of them guys because if you really are dedicated to wanting to get every six-pack you gonna have to make some of those modifications yeah I uncomfortably or to starve yourself because especially an athlean-x on our meal plans guys you you like ask any guy that program they actually enjoy the meals around so it does not mean starvation it just means not succumbing to these really bad cheat meals okay from here six-pack progression I in another video before guys we did a whole video on it I can actually link it right here that video guys talk about a sequence for your ab training now we getting more sophisticated now we want to start following specific sequencing lower abs bottom up rotation top down mid-range top down rotation okay static you know contraction of the ABS anti rotation rotation those things start to matter and you want to start following that we haven lay it all out for you in our 6-pack promise that comes with athlean-x to give you guys more of these specific workout my workout options but suffice it to say that at this point guys the sophistication level of your training of your apps specifically increases and finally all progression you want us pushing yourself again like I said that one extra rep that extra intensity that better effort on your conditioning workouts all of this going to add up to get you through this wall here at 10% and really get you down lean rib and athletic alright let guys right here the absolutely shredded 5% six seven percent body fat this is where guys you are going to become your own worst critic you know exactly what you have to work on these are the guys are gonna say I really want to get my obliques a little bit more I got to get my straightest to pop out a little bit more I got to work on those lower abs right this is where you become sort of a scientist of your own body your supplementation again fine-tuning guys you consistent with your supplementation by now you should be so consistent with your nutrition at this point everything should be dialed in it of tweaking to make sure that you look the way you want to look honestly guys I come out here and I film these videos for you guys each and every week I never pre film videos I do them in real time as you see I want you guys to see that it is possible to maintain a certain level of Asik physique and body fat year-round I cutting is BS it doesn I don you need to do that you can continue to add muscle I I couple of years by being consistent with my training by continuing to push myself hard and every workout and by becoming sort of in tune with my body to the point where this becomes automatic guys you can do it okay you can do it and I here put this all together for you in the athlean-x training system guys want to know what I do that is where I live and what I preach and I put that all together for you guys in a program that will help you again whether you Altman and you from thirty to forty percent body fat or whether you ripped and lean and just looking to gain that extra edge this is the program for you guys been saying it all along if you haven athlean athleanx.com I hope you guys found this incredibly long video to be helpful I know that it is longer than my usual but I think if you watch it even if you body fat you helpful and hopefully you can push a friend to the video and let him see it because I think if they start focusing on the right things they all the BS out of their heads that they these other videos that aren addressing the real deal and hopefully find this one to be the answer alright guys I week in just a few days actually let me know if you found this video helpful and let me know where you what get you exactly on that path to where you want to be alright guys talk to you soon [Music]	Success
Best Home Ab Workout (NO EQUIPMENT - ANY LEVEL!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx9SssAikQo	ATHLEAN - X	what I ab workout on New Year the time we all know that a lot of people look towards ways to change their bodies because we know that maybe the last time they thought about it was last New Year as a good coach a way to make you guys want to do the workout even if maybe you one of those guys who have waited for so long and you the same time I got to have the guys that I know that have been following my channel for a long time who want their ass kicked so I got to have the same workout challenge even the most advanced and allow those that are just starting out to find that motivation to do something and the last thing I have to do to make sure that there are no excuses is I weight workout a complete body weight no equipment no hanging bars nothing you can literally try this ab workout as soon as you finish watching this video or if you want you can do it along with me right so so we extinction technique with Extinction we others to keep pushing if they have the ability to or to just try it out if you all as we go but right now the most important thing is getting this workout started okay so as we start off the workout the first thing you want to notice is here at aan X if you haven very specific sequence in the type of movements we use with our AB training why because we want to use the strength of our ABS when when we have it the most to achieve the harder exercises and those are going to be the bottom up rotations and the lower ab movements as compared to those where we down so right off the bat we have our two down one ups for 45 seconds now what is Extinction all about as I do this Extinction is setting a bar in this case you have to do this exercise for 45 seconds if you can seconds great then you become extinct in that exercise and you move on to the next one you do it as long as you can so for a true beginner this work might only take about 5 or 6 minutes but if you are more advanced you do this exercise for the full 45 seconds if you make it all the way through the goal uh the goal for the exercise then you rest 10 seconds and 10 seconds only and from that point you then try to go after another round of it can you get through another 45 seconds if you can great you rest 10 seconds and you go through another round at some point you able to do that the rest is gonna is going to catch up the lack of rest is going to catch up and you become extinct in that one movement the next thing you do is you move on to the next here we rotation so here we have to get some rotation with a favoritism of the bottom moving towards the top and that is our figure eights the figure eights is a great exercise again for incorporating both lower abs and obliques into the same move we for 60 seconds the extinction on this is 60 seconds moving on mid-range the 21 crunch okay mid-range we the top and the bottom together at at the same time no better way than with this exercise Extinction number here you got 12 reps to do you have a 12 rep Extinction so you got to do 12 reps every single time and that includes right left and Center that make it all the way through 12 reps you rest your 10 seconds try to go for another 12 keep it going until you can do anymore now guess what you nice little 30 second rest great now get going again because we have a whole other half of this workout we got to move on to the obliques directly here we got scissor V ups for 45 seconds okay we to get through all 45 seconds if you a beginner and you make it through 20 guess what you got 20 great seconds of an ab exercise that you weren do 5 minutes ago that talking about progression so you do that and your Extinction number here is 45 seconds if you have the ability to do multiple sets next down top down straight top down moving the top towards the bottom our hip touch plank is actually an exercise that nobody has seen before because I made it for this video our hip touch plank is going to incorporate both a move and a plank upwards so we top down and a little bit of anti-rotation because we to rotate the trunk too much as we reach for that back hip puts a little extra strain on your abs because you have a three-point plank going on 15 to each side for each set if you can Extinction again at 15 each finally we wrap it all up with our top down rotation the Russian V tuck twist 16 reps to each side with an Extinction at I I had to do it to you eight reps so you might do multiple sets of this remember you only getting uh a maximum of 10 seconds between your completed sets before you have to go out it again so you will reach Extinction at some point and that go guys there with nothing but your own body weight and it it said in the beginning if you are ADV the key is it and that and whether or not it whatever day I don watch this you always got to get started if you haven have to start challenging yourself if you guys this is watch board Wednesdays back four years five years ago we kicked it all off here in this Channel and a lot of you guys have helped grow this to the point where we are while I now you back

Stop Doing Planks! (DO THIS INSTEAD)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYX5FpYZA7c	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what athleanx.com and I still [\\xa0__\\xa0] hate planks but you know what I do love puppies this is lucky my new rescue dog we got him from a shelter down in Alabama after some unbelievable human being if we call him that threw him out of a car and didn rescued on the side of a curb you gonna be seeing more of lucky here in our videos he team athlean what planks - okay so lucky has a problem with planks as well and that really need to address here today and that is why do I have this thing against planks I did a video about this a little while back it half views people have seen it I link it here and show it to here again at the end of the video you want to watch that and what I probably presented there was maybe the beginner side of the alternatives to planks see if you want to get better or stronger at anything you need to find a way to challenge yourself and the best way to challenge yourself is to apply levels of intensity to your exercises that make them more difficult the argument would be the same if you were doing a bench press and you use 20 pound dumbbells and you were capable of lifting 100 if all you did were those 20s and you added no intensity technique to that set you didn slow motion reps you didn half reps you didn different to those dumbbells in that set then you are not creating overload and far too many of us can handle far more than planks so what I want to do here is give you more options and maybe even skew a little bit more to the intermediate and advanced level so you have different things that you can do to ensure that you continue to make progression so let of those options now right away the first exercise you is I you have to clarify a plank doesn necessarily mean that I have to be laying down in the ground not in terms of what it is we of a plank is to create an anti extension or an anti movement challenge for your body and for your core try to be able to stay in one solid position despite what the forces around your body are and we know that we can do more than just resist extensions every time I go out the resistance of that band is creating now an actual lateral force here trying to bend me to the side and not just make me sag down in the middle like a regular plank does so this is a more versatile version of a plank it actually giving us a different challenge in a standard plank but it your body is not accustomed to if you only been doing standard planks we can still stay in standing here and challenge our body even different ways now we can do it in the rotational plane and all we have to do is hold up a pair of dumbbells again in the same playing position and now we do a very tight crossover right a grapevine with our feet as we walk side to side and you feel as soon as I take that step when I getting that hip rotation from down below having to maintain that stable core becomes a challenge this would be a more intermediate version of what the advanced version is and that is placing those dumbbells up overhead immediately now by having our arms way up high there that we have to consider in control and it becomes even more challenging to maintain that upright torso as I do this grapevine walk and crossover front and back but both of these again are versions of the same effect that a plank would create that are more challenging than just laying on the ground doing the same thing that you of doing so now if you want to go down back into that more standard version of the plank though the same positioning here let let something different and this is a banded press out plank what we do here is we load up one side with as heavy abandons we can handle we get into the plank position and now we try to drive that plant that that hand out against the resistance of the band and again what it pull me to that side a little bit again an anti lateral element here that we introducing that we don the standard plank we could take this even further now and get on top of a barbell this actually debuted on Instagram if you not following our Instagram you should it what we rotational challenge while still trying to maintain a tight core and doing so from the bottom and from the top so we get our hands over the top of the bar and now we try to twist that bar and again we twisted here by the shoulders but we really trying to resist everything from the chest down the ABS stay nice and tight the transverse abdominis is engaged then the feet the hips everything is staying sturdy and this becomes really challenging especially if you do it on a surface here where the barbell is a little tougher to roll and get moving once you get it moving - you have the element of momentum can we actually control it because once it gets going in one direction you got to stop it and then try to get it going back in the other direction definitely a challenging version here in this plank position and then taking that difficulty level up even one more time here is a wall jack plank so again we can plank but we put ourselves in a position where our feet are planted against the wall now we have to really drive our feet into the wall and really really tighten our core to prevent them from falling down and sliding down that wall but of course you know that want to make it a little bit more difficult than that so we can start doing our wall jacks which is essentially doing a horizontal jumping jack and again every time we jump our feet out and have to replant them again it contraction there of the core that demand high levels of force and stability and yet again clearly take us to a level far more difficult than that boring-ass plank and then finally we want to just get a little bit crazy you can do this here this is the tilting barbell plank and what you is you into the ground while lifting and rowing the elbow up on the other side so we actually turning this into again a 3-dimensional plank and we into almost a variation of a regular plank and a side plank as we stuck halfway in between but the goal is to try to drive up get into that side position maintain it stick it for as long as you can maybe two seconds maybe five seconds maybe even ten seconds and then come back down and then drive it up on the other side again the options are unlimited there do and even your Osia planks can be different as well you don getting into one position in holding it one time I better position that for you and do it 10 times holding it for a shorter period of time each time treat it like reps but the fact is you more than you are if you on the ground doing the same old plank that you better than all right guys if you looking for a program that that really stresses progress at every turn we know that in order to see changes we have to introduce challenges to our body at every opportunity and I do my best to do that for you week by week day by day in all of our programs if you for one of our programs head to athleanx.com right now and get them in the meantime if you found the video helpful if you hate [\\xa0__\\xa0] planks as well make sure you leave your comments down below as well and I read them alright guys we here again in just a couple days see ya	Success

ABS 101 - Step by Step Six Pack Plan! (TARGET EVERY AREA)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4jd2-kH_E	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com today we about the ABS and I and I think the most definitive video how you the best tips that you can apply to your ab training to make sure that you getting them to show now let me start off with a couple things when we talk about abs we the ABS alone I think you meaning everything in this region here and that muscles than just the abdominals I want to show you how to hit all of these things and of course we the muscle markers to help us to do that now one little kind of upfront caveat that I know we need to talk about because some people always come around these videos looking for that little shortcut I here to your face there is no shortcut when it comes to having your abs show if you refuse to watch what you in your mouth your diet is going to dictate how well your abs show every single time and no matter how much cardio you do you outrun a bad diet so if your diet is in check then you can start to see all the rewards of watching all these muscles come into play and to focus as you start to work them the way I you okay I want to make sure I cover that now let Anatomy since we about it when we look here at the core again we have the rhetorics of dominance here which is broken up into however many packs that damn jessie has an eight I seem to have six one two three four five six now the Linea Alba is this line that runs right down the middle and sutures across here which is going to compartmentalize the ABS into those regions and I you actually you can actually use that to your advantage here in the future to get these abs to pop a little bit more we but besides the rectus abdominus this muscle runs this way the fibers of this muscle runs up and down so that means that through flexion and extension keep in mind extension because we hit that - through flexion extension we can track that muscle but because we can actually flex the pelvis from the bottom up we know that we can actually hit the lower abs because the fibers are actually preferentially hit differently by having a lower portion of the pelvis move on on the top versus the top moving down on the bottom we can actually preferentially these two areas slightly differently depending upon the exercise that we choose so we have the upper region and the lower from the side here we have the obliques as I contract that run all the way down here at this oblique angle and they feed all the way down and in now we don obliques here but we also have the internal obliques that run up at this opposite angle so they run in this way and the external obliques run in this angle now you don all-important serratus which is the muscles that run up and through here and they push they help us to push our arm away from our body but there word for you guys they interdigitate meaning they enter the intertwine here with the external obliques to actually complete that look so when they working together as you can see here as they going to actually help to carve out that midsection completely so you don to ignore those and of course we finally have the transverse abdominus which runs across this way basically like your own inner weight belt okay and when it closes down and cinches down and contracts and provides support all the way around the midsection all the way through to the back of the spine okay so how are we gonna hit these areas now to make sure that we anatomy but we an exercise that job well it takes them again breaking them down one by one if we look at the first region here is sort of that lower ab region then we exercises like this that initiate the movement with the bottom moving on a fixed top okay so basically curling the pelvis up towards you now that can happen in any floor exercises and they seeing here the fact is that the pelvis is coming up towards the top again initiating the contraction from the bottom up and therefore slightly favoring those lower ab fibers now we can take that from there and then apply the same concept to hitting the upper abs and that means that we want to take any exercise that allows us to initiate the movement from the top down so maybe the leg stays stationary but the top and our shoulders are coming off the floor and creating that spinal flexion down towards the pelvis the next thing we want to do is if we gonna hit the obliques again guys I always talk about following the fibers we know that the obliques run at these acute diagonal angles here if we going to realize that that we know to know that rotation is going to help us to accomplish that and it doesn this way I could actually stay fixed here and rotate from the bottom so therefore we have top down rotation which is rotating on a fixed lower half or I have bottom up rotation which is rotating on a fixed upper half and there are a lot of different ab exercises that allow us to do this the keys that you want to make sure you exercises to effectively target the obliques specifically now we know again as I mentioned in the beginning the serratus is a muscle it doesn get that much love and exercises like this one here in particular are perfect at it this is actually done on a physio ball for a little extra stability challenge and we have our arms on the ball and once we get in that stable plank we try to push our arms straight through the ball allowing our back to rise up towards the ceiling even more and again it doesn just have to end there maybe you don have a physio ball we talked about doing it on a captain easily be the corner of a kitchen a counter top where you just get your body in there and you push your body away and lift away so that serratus actually doing its job another option for you here and finally the transverse abdominis again tends to have its own set of exercises or at least technique that allow us to hit that area because you have to really be conscious of keeping your belly pulled in and flattened and I second with some exercises because we specifically talked about the breathing being one of the main factors for controlling how well you are able to perform this as far as a sequence here guys and overall how would you stack these exercises together here general rule of thumb because we moving the legs in all those lower bottom-up movements we realize that may become pretty damn hard because of the weight of the legs that we have to move instantly making them the most difficult choices in all of our ab training arsenal so we want to make sure that we up rotation exercises early on and in whatever ab workout you you have your most strength it continues to sort of move up realizing that the rotational movements of just the obliques are going to become a little bit more challenging as well because rotation is something that a lot of us don to be a little bit weaker and again we tend to be doing this in combination with some spinal flexion so it makes it a little bit more difficult than say the same straight top-down movements usually come later so the mid-range and the top-down movements with our lower body fixed and just moving like a classic crunch would actually be a very easy ab exercise but done later in the workout when you becomes something that is still challenging for you so the idea is you move from the bottom up stick rotation in the middle there and you finish it out by doing your specialty exercises for your serratus and again for the transverse abdominus okay now that you know the anatomy and the exercises that hit those different areas and also a bit about the sequencing of how you want to structure your ab workouts I do have three incredible tips here that are going to make all of your ab workouts more effective and it starts with one of the simplest things guys cuz we do it every single time we do our ab exercises and start breathing but it important here this up when it comes to your breathing options and life in general you can either do two things well actually you can do three one you can either breathe in you can breathe out or you can hold your breath now we know that it advisable to be holding your breath or any of your exercises so you want to be doing either one or the other but what we do is we want to breathe out on the exertion of any exercise meaning whatever exercise you are exerting yourself or coming up so a classic example will be the crunch as I come into the crunch that part I want to breathe out every time hanging a leg raise any time I and doing the movement that want to be breathing out but here key difference you have two opportunities for the abdomen what it doing you can either be pushing out like that or you can be cinching in which would be tightening it down like that and that abdominis that I referred to in the beginning of the video comes in the transverse helps to contract again in this way like a weight belt to keep this down what you want to do is you want to make sure that as you are breathing out that you want to breathe out and push out at the same time because what you you wall and actually doing exactly opposite what it is you entire video you having more bloated appearance or weakened abdominal appearance so with every exercise you do remember to breathe out on the exertion and cinch down at the same time you have a much better-looking set of ABS now we can take that a step further now by actually looking at something else that we happen to do wrong and that is the lack of extension in full range of motion on AB training guys what happens all the time if you train on the floor exclusively or if you train even on a bar or let and do kind of a decline ab exercises the bench the floor even hanging here is limiting your body and if we know that the true function of the ABS is to move from an extended position here where they into a flex spine now where they contracted where is the extension on all those other exercises you stopping yourself on the floor you stopping yourself on the bench a lot of times when guys get up here they never get themselves into an extended position here they just stay right in the middle well what happens from that is you literally doing the equivalent of taking a tricep pushdown and starting here and finishing here you contracted position to a less contracted position you on the triceps and we want to make sure that we do that with our ab training so make sure that when you floor work you at least include some exercises that allow you to slide a towel underneath your low back to get yourself into more of an extended state or when you ab exercises here make sure that when your legs come down you allow your body to extend and get a stretch on the ABS before you initiate the next contraction the key is don the abdominal muscles still themselves have full range of motion and you want to make sure that you and then finally a lot of guys will ask me Jeff I actually can see my abs but I don real deep cuts what do you do to get your abs to pop more and that is actually just a factor of probably omitting weighted ab exercises and powerful ab exercises from your training and what I mean by that is we talked about it again at the beginning of this video the Linea Alba being one of the key features of the abdominal muscles including how they separate and divide the compartments into that four pack six pack or eight pack you cannot change the structure of that you cannot change its ability to either allow you to have a four pack or a six pack or an eight pack you have what you have but what you can do is you can hypertrophy those abdominal muscle by including weighted ab work to make them pop out more from the sutured down area of the Linea Alba which will give you a deeper looking set of abs so what we do is we do a lot of weighted ab exercises like the ones you seeing here you can see that we can do them with the other with a dumbbell or actually by hanging weights off of our legs and doing weighted leg raises anything that weight an exercise that we normally wouldn the muscles to be subjected to the same loading parameters that you would with any other muscle group which can lead to hypertrophy the thing that we want to also focus on is how you them because we realize that always training your abs slowly now that bad thing because want to make sure we get good contraction but always train your ab slowly is really doing a disservice to the fact that there are type 2 fibers and your abdominal muscles that aren training them explosively so start to include some high velocity movements here that allow you to get a stronger more powerful contraction quicker and your muscles will respond by actually growing a bit and having you have a deeper looking appearance to your abs first guys always say if you want to look like an athlete you got to Train like an athlete and that means training explosively and it muscles your abs or muscle that could be trained explosively as well this is six-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Antonio Brown right here doing one of the ab sessions that we do and we get explosive the fact is if you want your abs to be too pop you need to train them explosively and powerfully so the fact that guys there we want to consider when it comes to complete our training program and I think that all of them matter as you see here not just understand the anatomy and understand that there the ABS than just the ABS alone but knowing how to hit them and having a plan of attack for how to hit them in your ab workouts and then holding on to those key key tips that allow you to get more range of motion a better breathing pattern and including the right types of exercises it all matters guys at athleanx.com I care about it all I always say we put the science behind the strength if you complete program on how to train your abs and to look like an athlete guys you got to train like an athlete so all these things always matter head over there and get our athlean-x training program the meantime if you found this video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know else I can cover for you I for you the days and

LOWER ABS UNLEASHED - 3 Exercises! (V-CUT Abs)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVR4mbOC82w	ATHLEAN - X	factor fiction can you actually train to get your lower abs in that elusive v-taper to show more you absolutely can but you have to do the right exercises and today I just that what athleanx.com that elusive v-taper right the one down here the lower ab region that leads down you know where can you actually train to get that to pop more the answer is yes but first and foremost you have to be able to reveal it right I don crap out of your lower abs if you don have a load of my fat level you going to show that so that start with your nutrition you want to make sure that your nutrition is locked in besides that when we actual training though it is possible but you have to change the way that you think about training the lower abs you have to understand that in order to get this area to show more you have to know that there are involved and these areas here actually the inguinal ligament there sort of a blend of muscles that work their way into either inserting into them this way or running in the same direction and most of all guys that the internal and the external obliques so we can and straight one plane lower ab movements if we want to get this to show we have to work on incorporating internal external obliques which is going to be a lot of rotation at the same time and and this is the big one we have to make sure that we work on the muscles that lay underneath that area and that one transverse abdominus which any of you guys who Pilates that focus on and that weightlifter belt that goes around you this way the point of the fact of the matter is we need to develop that it allows the muscles above here to pop a little bit more so how do we do that all in one exercise well I you now and I you three different ways that you can work it if you put them together or serve if you have a great great low ab workout that the way that it and that guys you remember you gotta train yourself the way the muscles are meant to be trained so what we do is we grab here onto a hanging bar okay and you going to grasp your fingers over top of each other and hang down now as you going to see the first thing we want to do is remember I said the transverse right here you can already see this contracting because we flatten out the transverse abdominus we do that by almost acting as if you just walked into ice-cold water if you guys walk in ice-cold water you man is freezing right you through here which makes this muscle pop because that transverse runs beneath that area so you want to engage that first flattening it out then you gonna twist as you can see as soon as I twist the external obliques will contract okay external and internal obliques external on one side over here internal obliques on the other side and then we leg lifts so turn and Lynne leg lifts and then down and turn rotate leg lifts down and in rotate leg lifts down and in all right so one great way to do it let pull-up bar no problem do it down on the floor so what we doing is position ourselves in front of anything that we can just to anchor ourselves on grab up here and when we pull back you get a lot of guys do straight leg reverse crunches whatever you want to call them but we got to get it up at the same time want to pull down on that transverse like we talked about and then we got to get that rotation in there too so it to the left and down okay up and twist all the way to the right and down you feel that lighten up these areas right here finally they take you over to a band exercise you can do to really finish this area off anchor a band low could be around the leg of a couch could be around the bedpost whatever it is get down on the ground a great way to activate the transverse is to get a plank position because in order to hold that posture the right way you got to have the transverse working so you get into a plank your arm reaching out in front of you here like that again pulling up on the ABS to keep your transverse engaged come up rotate drive your knee across your body so here that rotation and then the elbow in and then up up up if I show you from the other side looks like this you that a little bit more here driving you see the rotation and in again driving up and working on that be cut at the same time remember you can get on the show gotta have that dying right doesn to be restrictive it just has to be right and you got to use the right exercises and both of these things are covered with athlean-x training I said if you want to look like an athlete you got to Train like an athlete athletes need internal and external obliques to work with the transverse abdominis to work with the rectus all these muscles work together you don want to do it out there you don to do it in the gym not if you want to look like an athlete so God anybody that might be new to athlean-x training you got to check out what we all about head over to athleanx.com and see what it training like an athlete in the next 90 days you can actually start looking like one I athleanx.com the meantime if you found this video helpful make sure you comment leave your thumbs up maybe even share with your

How to Get ÂVÂ Cut Abs (NO BULLSH*T!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgC7p14h3rY	ATHLEAN - X	what athletenext.com so today i wanted to make a video to show you guys how to get that more developed v-cut line right and with at the risk of making sure this stays a g video that line right here right we can see that kind of leads down towards the the junk right now look it the anatomy which we into because when you understand the anatomy it will guide how you train we always talk about following the fibers and understanding it but it always has to start whenever we talk about anything abdominal in terms of revealing what we trying to get that v cut area it has to start with this sort of good news bad news good news situation the good news is you guys know that on this channel i going to give you the actual real advice that you need so you can start to make the improvements you need to make right that the bad news is that it quite a commitment on your part through your nutrition to make this area visible especially because we know that when men lose body fat especially especially from around the waist that they tend to lose it up top first it starts to come down here and the last area to go is going to be that lower abdominal area the most stubborn is going to be that lower abdominal area meaning your level of consistency is going to have to be very high you can just do something for two weeks a crash diet for two weeks and think you gonna reveal this area down here you going to need to be consistent with nutrition to the point that you can lower your body fat levels significantly enough to get down where those lower abdominal areas are low in body fat so you that now if you that helped guide you i actually did a whole video on a very simple plate technique that i want you guys to use it process again simplification will lead to consistency if you step-by-step plan i literally have my entire meal plan exactly what i eat included in all of our athletics programs over athletenext.com so now the good news though because there good news even though you have to do that guys there to start training the muscles that feed this v cut namely the obliques because we know that the obliques have visibility far up the chain here they not just visible down here at that line right they they the external oblique is feeding this area here and we know as we said that we can start to lose body fat at a higher level of the torso so we can start to see some of the tapering benefits of training the obliques so it you can start to focus on these things now even while you the nutrition now let anatomy actually for the anatomy here we muscle markers when we literally talking about the obliques and i actually did this in the video before i showed you and you can see here this is what that quote-unquote v-cut area looks like when covered with fat and this is the same area when the body fat is stripped off what difference nothing just the body fat the the level of development of the obliques is what stands out because the body fat is removed so we want to make sure that we because there are two different obliques we have the obliques that come in this direction here right we know those are the external obliques right and they actually feed through their tendonitis attachment into this thickened area over here it called an apologist the thickening where the muscle leads into a tendonous sheath okay and the bottom border of that is this inguinal ligament all right just the bottom board that feeds that bottom border but the bulk of this here again this whole thickening here is all coming from external oblique that down into that now we also have the internal oblique that goes in the opposite direction it feeds this way now interestingly what it does is it feeds perpendicularly into that apologist that thickening okay that angular ligament the benefit of that and knowing that is that we talk about all the time the importance of following the fibers right shortening of fiber in that direction along its direction here is going to help to develop that muscle well we know that when a muscle contracts it transmits force through the tendon that is that it blends into so if we can have an impact on the tendon that it blends into we know that we can actually feed into this aponeurosis and start to help to develop that more how do we do that we focus on the internal oblique now while we can see this because it external oblique we can actually activate it fairly easily there components to doing this the first thing you want to do is you want to lay down on the floor here like you do and you want to flatten that belly out more importantly you want to activate the transverse abdominis the transverse abdominis is going to flatten the entire midsection you can see that as soon as i do this i immediately see that v cut line pop more prominently why because the transverse abdominis has its own tendon in the sheath that actually blends with the internal obliques tend in the sheath to attach right into this area that we we know that if we can flatten the stomach by pulling the belly button down so you can see me here again to activate the transverse i i draw in you can see once i draw in this becomes more prominent again out and relaxed draw down and in and it becomes more prominent here okay so the first part is that the second part is getting just basic abdominal activation we could do that with a posterior pelvic tilt right so if i again you can see me now in my back that i get that transverse abdominus activation and i pull up with the posterior pelvic tilt getting the trunk to curl getting more abdominal contraction now here comes the most important part rotation in the same direction of the side that you contract why because if you follow those fibers guys you realize that rotation in this direction down in this direction following the fibers is going to make that internal oblique contract if we can get contraction through that muscle realizing that the force will transmit through that tendon we can get an activation in this exact area that we trying to target now we one side at a time and to do that you going to do this exercise here it actually more of just a contraction drill i said i do the flattening i do the trunk curl and then i rotate in that direction you can see and actually feel how intense of a contraction that is right on that line right on that v cut area and what i want you to do is just use this again as a neuromuscular drill i want you to include it with whatever ab training you athletics programs we train abs every single day you can incorporate the additional work just with just a couple extra sets of let six to seven second contractions ten good quality ones all right the fact is guys if you do what i in conjunction with the nutrition and getting your nutrition in check as you drop those body fat levels this v cut line will become much more prominent again you can see here that when i make that turn in that direction here and then in that i get that v cut line becoming more established and again more visible that there work i promise you you better control of there a lot of these guys just don the area they don contract their abs let alone or create a pelvic tilt let alone get these areas to actually contract when we about the obliques but this is your attack plan for doing that hopefully you found the video helpful guys if you looking for more science-based training and advice you well make sure you head over to atlantis.com and get one of our training programs again we put the science back in everything we do because it matters in the meantime if you found the video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know

The BEST Dumbbell Exercises - ABS EDITION!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPrsuV3E-Dc	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com so today we continue our popular best dumbbell exercise series this time for your abs that actually can use dumbbells to train your abs a matter of fact you should be using dumbbells to train your abs if you want the best looking abs because just like any other muscle in your body this particular muscle group will respond to overload and we can do it with a dumbbell now are there other ways to overload your abdominal muscles of course there are you can use a med ball like I haven one make sure you do at athlean-x which requires that you be a quick explosive and powerful but it appear in this video because we limiting ourselves to dumbbells another alternative here that I also showcased on instagram was this plate drag then I have a plank position it create a strength overload but as I said we dumbbells and we doing so I am going to pick the best exercise for each of the following categories the best strength exercise the best for power for hypertrophy the best total body ab exercise of the dumbbell it actually exists something for more of a correct abuse metabolic exercise and then one that doesn really fit any of the categories here but is no less important and that is our best miscellaneous exercise the fact is guys as we always have done here we gonna put the science behind the strength why we select what we select with that being said let list off right with a best exercise for strength all right so when we about AB strength here there we probably have all experienced first hand and that is whenever we move our legs towards our head versus our head towards our legs it harder and the reason for that is because we we are the weight of our legs alone is oftentimes enough to overload those movements to make them a challenge however it doesn trying to shy away from adding external load if possible mad at matter of fact you can do this with a couple of different exercise selections I do think there strength we have in our ABS when we move from the top down for the very reasons I just explained so I would separate this selection into two choices the first one would be when we come from the top down this exercise here the oldest up we simply have one dumbbell in your hand and the only challenge is to get to a halt sitting position here and then lower yourself back down slowly eccentric ly under control of the ABS then we swap hands we come back again you can see that the legs are not participating here they they the feet aren extra contribution I all of the work now if we wanted to overload the bottom-up movement a lot of us might run over to this exercise here that hang a leg raise and throw a dumbbell between our feet but if you doing this right here then you really not strengthen your abdominal muscles instead you flexors which is going to cause a problem down the road particularly maybe in the form of some low back pain because you as opposed to doing this and that is actually trunk curling curling from the pelvis causing flexion of the spine with the strength of the abdominals but I wouldn exercise of choice instead I would do this here and this is a dragon thrust and what we do is we set ourselves up with the dumbbell between our feet anchor ourselves to something sturdy behind us and then you simply just try to lift the pelvis up all that action of getting the pelvis lifted into the air is going to be the tremendous responsibility of the lower abs and then when you extend your legs out you making the moment arm longer making it more of a challenge for the ABS but you get that relief of being able to bring it back temporarily some will find that they repetitions here and create some additional overload that they might not have been able to do here either correctly or even at all on the hanging leg raise so it comes to power now we have to introduce something else not just the ability to move some weight or to have some external force that we can overcome but can we actually overcome it quickly can we do it in an explosive manner that is where power is and we can do this here with this dumbbell twisting toe tap so I almost preset the ABS I preload them because of the rotation stretch I get by dropping the dumbbell down to the side and then I come up and I lift by moving both the top and the bottom together to meet in the middle and then I reload on the opposite side again I from both sides here and I come back up touch the toe on the other side and repeat again there synchronization between the lower and the top half and more importantly there load speed this is where power is at and I invite you guys to try this exercise and you so when it comes to hypertrophy that actually something you should not avoid when it comes to the abdominal muscles a lot of us think I don ass because they looking that remember if we development of the ABS the hypertrophy of the abdominal muscles is going to create abs that pop abs that are more visible and my favorite way to do that here is with the weighted levitation crunch now this is a slow movement this is one we but it has the incredible benefit of an overloaded East centric and we do that because we introduced this physio ball and when we land the physio ball you can see that when I lay back over it I getting a stretch on the ABS I an exaggerated stretch on the ABS then I then have to come out of that elongation that eccentric contraction in the ABS is something we don when you think about the fact that most of our ab exercises are done flat on the floor and we can position on the ball we can when we come out of this every single contraction should be purposeful you should think about trying to contract each row of the ABS the top the middle bottom each row one at a time to really get an intense contraction both of those elements are something that we it comes to building muscle we know that an intentional contraction and the introduction of the eccentric overload or both elements are going to help us to do exactly that to grow your abs to ultimately make them look better so when we overload with an exercise we generally pick an exercise that allows for a full range of motion and lots of contractions and as that burn accumulates we realize that it metabolites hydrogen ions lactic acid things that actually start to accumulate within the muscle that make us want to cry and stop in the goal being continue don that we can do that here with ABS but I suggest something slightly different instead of trying to get a bunch of repetitions of flexing and extending why don and for stabilizing the spine but still creating a challenge then we want to resist that burn on and we can best do it here with one of two options number on this exercise here called rock the boat this is actually an isometric challenge for the ABS that is preventing movement rotation and actually extension through this one stable position where I try to challenge myself left and right now the goal again gives not stopping when it just starts to burn but continuing as long as I can preventing the breakdown of this stable position at any point during the exercise and if you don doing this you can try this instead this is a hollow rock done with a dumbbell and the idea being here once again as you lock yourself into the position and you dumbbell to challenge this position even further look people do this exercise without a dumbbell at all it challenging the idea being you to reach that metabolic overload a bit faster because the demands on the muscle are greater the goal here is just to get in this position stay stable and rock and keep going and resist that burn rep after rep after rep never compromising the stability of your core in the process guys both of these options are good ones whichever one you pick I promise you from it alright so moving on now we have our total body exercise and who would have thought there exercise that but everything else in the process well there is and it here it anytime we elongated body we an instability of our entire body but if I wanted you to become as stable as possible you might even do this and really crunch down and stay tight but as soon as I make you as long as I can I introduced a destabilization well guess what the ABS do really really well they create stability so if we do this exercise like this we to have stability created instantly to be able to allow us to walk steadily to allow us to keep those arms up as tall as possible overhead and to create the ability to not have a leaning left and right or twisting or falling forward or backwards all of this is a responsibility of the abdominal muscles and we really well with this one simple exercise simply walk around the gym your house whatever available space you have with a pair of dumbbells up overhead with a combined weight that quarter of your body weight and just keep walking stay tall stay focused and try this exercise I promise you do good things for you so when it comes to the corrective exercise selection here you go for the back and you but I that you think we do a lot of lumbar strengthening in our athlean-x programs and here on this channel but what we don stretching the muscles of the low back that do tend to get tight a lot of times as compensation for other areas that aren here is great for that and this is the dumbbell ab roll-up the purpose here of the dumbbell is to create a couple of things number one it actually assists us in getting to the top and assists us in getting a stretch on the hamstrings and on that low back in this forward position as we go back down it actually becomes an eccentric challenge for us as we try to paint one segment at a time back down to the floor it creates control at every segment demanding that we have the ability to lay down one vertebra at a time which is something that doesn people clunk down to the floor because they overexert their abs at some position on the way back they just don have the strength there see I end and just do a couple to really rip out and really explore that flexibility that I simple exercise and now finally we have that miscellaneous category where I get to hit sort of the other muscles that don ab exercises are giving us and this exercise is one of my all-time favorites it is the weighted gymnast ab tuck I have covered this exercise many times on this channel because of how good it is but it it good it tuck this posterior tilt of the pelvis being loaded now with the dumbbell it also got the fact that we can include twisting and rotation which immediately as you see here is going to involve the obliques we know how crucial the interaction between the obliques and abdominal muscles is so why not train it and we could do it so well with this and not just that to be able to keep our body in this position and stay tall as the pelvis is coming up we overloading the all-important muscle that also gets overlooked and it serratus anterior so we get that sort of triple threat going on here one exercise making it the perfect exercise for this miscellaneous category in the perfect way to complete and round out our seven selections so they have the guys my best dumbbell exercise selections for abs and as I mentioned the open if it you make sure you introduce them soon like today because these are going to provide a benefit that than anything you if you aren exercises if you that actually combines all of these exercises as an option into an entire eight-week ab training cycle you can get it over in the app store the 6-pack promise and also in the Android store the six-pack promise in the meantime you for

How to Get Toned Abs (IN ANY LIGHTING!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I457C4kZ-DU	ATHLEAN - X	what if you then we got to start by defining what toned really is see toned by the general definition means being able to see a muscle more right if I have a muscle that I flex it it looks more ton somebody might say that I have a harder looking muscle a more tone looking muscle okay that good but that of tone especially as a physical therapists when we deal with people that have medical conditions that limit the amount of tone that they can have or tonicity they can have in their muscles then we want to start defining it the right way and what that is is basically the resting level of activity or the resting level of tension or contraction in a muscle so again if my muscle at rest looks like this right little bit loose whatever it wouldn as somebody that had a resting level of tension like that right if there was a level of tone now tone can be a pathological thing you can be in a state of high tone and not be in a good State because diseases can lead you to have increased tone all the time which becomes actually very very uh uh problematic but when you you want to get increased muscle tone the first Way by having something that looks more visibly toned in in shape that you you fat that you have that shape of the muscle that shape of that muscle gets improved by working out but it gets revealed by getting rid of some of the body fat to show more muscle tone if you want to increase your tone though where you already kind of at a lower level there two things you can do from an AB standpoint number one you want to start getting up here on the bar and doing lots of hanging leg raises in different variations of ab movements from the bar for two reasons tone can be increased by the level of stretch a muscle so when we more stretch I so you can see much more stretch in the bottom than we would from a a floor-based Ab movement Okay the reason why stretch works is that if you think about what tone actually does in your body one of its functions is to protect us and if we like this and you know it snaps us back because it feels the stretch on the front of the neck and kind of stretches just back to the front you can increase resting tone resting level activity in a muscle by doing more stretch loaded exercises so that number two go to the hard exercises when you activity and effort that must be uh exerted here on these exercises then let or planks and things like that and again it goes back to the idea of waking up the muscles getting muscles to become more activated increasing the level of contribution of the muscle fibers to an activity makes it more toned in Long Run start opting for harder versions to involve more effort to involve more activity from all the muscles in your core and you resting tone and you got to make sure of course you cuz if you want to look for the the general definition of tone then get rid of all that uh fat that your hard work okay if you for exercises and a meil plan kind of hit you and give you that onew combination then head to aex.com right now and get our athletex training system it comes with our athletex Factor meal plans everything included okay all in one spot I a couple days make sure you leave your comments and your requests down below and I videos to you here each and every week I	Success
How to Get 6 Pack Abs (WHILE BUILDING MUSCLE SIZE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTkMNrBusgQ	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com so what do you think is it possible to add new muscle at the same time that you we know that nutrition is certainly one of the biggest components of getting abs but for those that think that following both goals at the same time pursuing more muscle and the lean body at the same time was impossible that bulking and cutting is the only way we have some fun today start up the fire pit because we sacred cows bulking and cutting is gonna die once again here today it is probably the biggest pet peeve and it a Jeff rant video because I can every time I here I right now and you probably know the guys are talking about bulking and cutting every single guy that talks about bulking cut being necessary is a fat guy that likes to be fat for half the year it guys will try to make up some excuse to carry excess fat all year so in the end of the day when they wind up leaning out they look just a little bit better than they did before when they were lean the last time we don so you can absolutely 100% get a six-pack at the same time that you build new muscle and for those guys that want picture proof all I have to do is look to my own guys that follow our program on team athlean and show you that and I and we actually acknowledge some of the guys for the great work that they the same time it should add additional proof to you that yes this is possible the first guy up here is Dan boiler now this is your younger guy obviously was on the thin side he didn movie called average he just he didn have much muscle he didn but look at Dan boiler now he with athlean-x now training for a couple years but he clearly added a bunch of lean muscle this isn do this but you can only add about two or three pounds of lean muscle Dan has added plenty of lean muscle in this period of time if we go further we got another guy Jim Knox here and I don our guys on team athlean must love tattoos and that they can wear that with pride on these bodies that they see with Jim gee it was another guy who was skinny and he of lean muscle now at the same time that he got a six-pack and before you start saying that oh well that guys were skinny and it wasn director Morrison okay let me show you some guys who aren years old so you can excuse either 51 years old that had what you might think is the average 51 year old guy has clearly added muscle look at the differences in the chest look at the differences in his shoulders and his arms he done at the same time they got out and we can go even to the extreme Jack Feldman is another guy not a spring chicken and I can say that because I not either jack has also managed to go from a guy that was clearly overweight to a guy that now has abs and he has built impressive muscle - so now let go back to what the issue at hand is the issue at hand is were getting told bad advice from guys that like I said want to be fat for half the year do you know that what happens the average guy that comes out of a bulk never makes it out of the bulk he gets so comfortable eating the crappy foods that for every one guy that comes out of a bulk and actually gets lean there guys that stay fat you see them all the time in the gym I know you do so what do we have to do we have to bake it down to what we actually have to do to get leads and we can do it you guys can all do it - there things you want to get a six-pack at the same time that you to get a six-pack this is if you need to lose weight not a guy like damn boiler but if you need to lose weight like a guy like Jack or Alex then what you have to do is you have to be hypocaloric and that means you have to take in less calories okay and burn more collagen you two or three different ways number one you can either exercise more or do more conditioning or cardio okay the next thing you can do is you can eat less or you can do a little bit of both you can eat less and exercise more now here the problem number two you have to stay in positive nitrogen balance if you want to maintain or build muscle mass the the things that influence muscle balance positive nitrogen I nitrogen balance here is you need to a keep your stress levels low okay hey decrease your stress B you need to sleep more in other words leap adequately recover and then C you need to increase your protein content or at least make sure you protein throughout the day to support your body to build new lean muscle so when guys started saying oh well I sure I eat enough to build new new muscle they keep eating more and more and even if they sources the problem becomes they choose not the healthiest protein options and I even talk talking about dirty bulking dirty bulking is complete [\\xa0__\\xa0] I about guys are trying to clean both and they eat so much protein that comes with other things protein is never really it come by an isolation at least tasting well in isolation guys will usually have a steak and potatoes and they have the things that come with it they use some sour cream all those things start adding up and that starts to give you a lot more difficult time to stay hypocaloric so the guys that say oh it have the discipline to eat the right way in the first place you can stay in positive nitrogen balance you can have a high protein diet or high enough to support your new muscle growth and also be hypocaloric by selecting nutritionally dense foods as you can eat a lot in a day if you select nutritionally dense foods I about on a micronutrient level nutritionally dense foods foods that are really good for you at the same time to support your need for protein this is where supplements come in unbelievably can very very conveniently guys will argue are supplements necessary are they not I believe that supplements are necessary you guys know how much I believe in them I add my own supplements I take them all the time I actually have to we have a workout shake that we take at night for recovery which also helps us with our recovery here and this part of the picture for our positive nitrogen balance and we have our post-workout protein recovery - but that of protein right there without all the excess very low in calories so we can stay hypocaloric and at the same time we can build muscle but if you this and you like Jack was in the beginning maybe your 30 percent body fat don running to my site trying to buy the supplements that issue is that you can hypocaloric to lose the fat in the first place because you your six-pack is there you might be doing all the 6-pack promise workouts in the world but you it hypocaloric but you can if you start to follow a better way to eat if you start eating more more reasonably way right and stay away from the bulking and cutting stay away from it like I said for every guy that winds up coming out of that there make it they want to be perpetually fat for the rest of their lives they hide under shirts at the gym all day there they wind up follow like all the big guy line yoga we lost the big guy big guy but he guys are watching this channel aren looking for that the guys are looking at watching this channel one no can I get a 6-pack of building muscle at the same time you absolutely can I out for you guys in the blueprint we have our athlean-x training system I give you the eating plan I tell you exactly how to eat day my day I tell you ways to optimize your protein intake so that you nitrogen balance I give you a supplement line should you choose to follow it that staying low in calorie we all the fillers and it allows you to do that and you can follow the same footsteps as the guys I just showed you Jim and Alex and Dan and Jack and those guys and even bump into myself I put myself out here as an example each every week but please stop with the bulking cutting [\\xa0__\\xa0] seriously I don to hear that ever again and if a guy comes to you and tells you it way to do it newbies are the ones that forget newbies what is this guys is this a lifelong journey for you or is this just a one-month sprint to see what you could look like for a photo shoot because that either we living athletic being athletic even if you not looking good for a couple videos on YouTube then hiding for the rest of the year we come out here three times a week every single week to look good every single day and that believe in a team athlean that guys that follow us do too so guys I doubled my RAM take the bulking and cutting throw it away that fire that that sacred cow has now been roasted follow the plans I you take our washboard Wednesday workouts yes build your ab strength do that each and every time I put them out here but for God this right first if you think that you want to get both at the same time that absolutely possible don by anybody that says it guys you found this video helpful make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below in the meantime I here again in just a couple days to use some brand new workouts let me know whatever it is that you want to see I be sure to cover it we got like I said three videos a week and I do it see you guys	Success
5 Red Flags for Weak Abs (FIX THIS!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSROJpBIZ4w	ATHLEAN - X	what athletenext.com today we about weak abs and it not want because if you have weak abs they every element of your training so today i want to help you to identify five things we call them red flags five things that will help you to find out right away where you and more importantly what you could do to fix it we by one let the first red flag that you with some weak abs is that when you do your ab exercises your hip flexors fatigue before your abs do let me show you an example here guys on a hanging leg raise if i go and i lift my legs up and i find that after however many repetitions my legs are feeling heavy and i can abs feel pretty fresh that letting the hip flexors drive the movement that i was on the ground doing a scissor yes this is an isometric hip flexor exercise where i keep my legs off the ground the entire time but if that is what is failing if that is what again i as opposed to the abdominals what you need to do is flip that around you have to engage the abdominals up here on the hanging leg raise you curl the pelvis you curl the pelvis if the pelvis is curling and flexing we know the abdominals are doing their job because that we know that the hip flexors on the other hand they actually can pull you into an anterior tilt extending here through the midsection so you want to make sure that you the ground same thing if i a scissor i get my back off the ground to get us into flexion that now activates the abdominals first and then allows the hip flexors to go along for the ride guys it point do not allow on any ab exercise you just start feeling fatigue here first if you do it okay so we mentioned the overactivity of the hip flexors but that can actually lead directly to this next red flag and that is the presence of low back pain whenever you do your ab exercises that is something you do not want to tolerate and it to fix so we can actually look at that and why that traditional sit-up now this is not necessarily my favorite exercise guys but it is something that is functional and you relates to one of the red flags later on however in a traditional setup what are you looking for when you come up off the ground do you see the following do you first of all need somebody to anchor your feet down are you sticking your feet under something i know who you are under something in order to be able to perform the exercise because if you are you shouldn you come up your shoulders trail you get a significant arch in your low back you have weak abs that cannot allow the third thing is if on the way down you slam down to the to the ground uncontrollably that is once again due to weak abs and those are all related to the one thing i mentioned here in the beginning and that is a dominance of the hip flexors the hip flexors taking over so here want to do we want to make sure that we don thing you can do is actually change the way you hook your feet instead of allowing them to be pressed down and you hooking them under something you want to put them over something and drag back that actually does the complete opposite anatomically you the hamstrings by pulling your heels into that which is going to help to shut down the hip flexors or at least decrease their activity so that now i not getting that pull on the low back i exercises the second thing you want to do is you want to be able to put yourself back down on the ground one segment at a time to literally paint your spine down one segment at a time and when you come off the ground you paint yourself off of the ground one segment at a time that guarantee that you first before the hip flexors why we take a look at one more thing if we don the hip flexors first right and i get my line a pull from here i pull it actually pulls jesse into extension puts a lot of unnecessary force on the lumbar spine creating the pain that you feeling however if we can get the abs to activate first if i were to now simulate the line of pull of the abs i one segment at a time off i the abs to contribute on the way back down look at the control i have over his torso as he goes down actually the brakes applying this this slow down and this controlled descent that back down to the ground you got to have that you got to have your abs driving first you can the next red flag is actually going to reveal itself to you when you perform any of your three big lifts the squat the bench press or the deadlift now look we know that the roll of the abdominals during those movements is to stabilize embrace your core throughout them to add efficiency to the movements to clean up the bar path what we though is for dramatic increases in strength and this is actually supposed to be somewhat of a background activity and it mind muscle connection than let overall ab strength however there something you can do what i want you to do is test yourself on each of the exercises that i just named the next time you perform them try to actively really brace as hard as you possibly can if you notice just simply a better bar path more efficiency all the things i already mentioned then good then i know that your ab strength and your mind muscle connection most and most importantly is where it needs to be however if you feel like you can start adding 60 or 70 pounds to the bar just because you actively braced then what that tells me is actually bad news it tells me that you are not doing that right now it tells me that unless you heavily focus on doing that in the exercise itself you and that is a significant weakness albeit in my muscle weakness it a weakness that head every time you perform these exercises especially as you start to add more weight to the bar red flag number four actually can be revealed just by looking in the mirror as a matter of fact turning sideways and looking in the mirror because if you see this distended lower belly here then you are likely suffering from a weakness that you need to address this is a major red flag this here is not what i want i want you to be here not here but here you the main difference there all you did was contract yes you did was i contracted the transverse abdominis and i have the ability to contract the transverse abdominus because i have the strength to contract the transverse abdominis that muscle is just like this weight belt here guys what its roll is it runs like this just like a weight belt would in terms of its orientation of the fibers it does the same thing that a weight belt does as it contracts it cinches down here contracts it cinches down it creates that smallness of the waist it creates that tightness inherently by performing like a weight belt would now you want to make sure you have the ability to do that and you need to make sure you can do it by practicing it and by ingraining it and integrating into every ab exercise you do so if you see me doing the scissor here guys you don want to allow yourself to distend while you too passive that what you want to do is you want to draw down cinch down on your belly your lower belly to create this flatness by contracting the transverse abdominis again thinking about it like a weight belt and performing your scissors on every single rep and the same thing here during a v up you don to disdain as you come up you pull down first contract and then you come up this might dramatically lessen the number of reps you do but you number of quality reps you do and over time the more strength you get in the transverse abdominis the less you this distention here anytime you take your shirt off okay last but not least is actually a little bit of a four-part red flag here but this is gonna be fun because you gonna get a chance to do these things and actually they sort of step up in difficulty so i wanna see if you can keep and stay with me for all four of these the first one actually is pretty easy and jessie all i want to do is be able to get off the floor i want you to be able to do the same thing how do you guys think he did he you can see i see i want you to be able to get off the floor without ever using your hands and that goes for your elbows and your forearms as well you should be able to get your center of mass up and over your knees and to a standing position without ever having to rely on your hands and if you can your abs are weak now you can have strong abs and do this test you will still feel your abs working to get you there that is exactly what happen however if you can without the use of your hands that major red flag and you probably can on with these other tests however if you did make it let level now okay next we want to try to test each of the planes individually and the first one up is the frontal plane can you prevent motion side to side and the easiest way to test that is with a suitcase carry and all you have to do is pick up one dumbbell that of your body weight and try to carry it for one lap around the gym or 30 seconds without allowing your shoulders to drop noticeably on the weighted side in other words can you walk dynamically move here without allowing your spine to bend towards the side that in order to do that you have to have good abs stability and strength on the opposite side to do that if you don guys it is a major red flag because we need to be able to prevent motion not just in this plane but all three we have additional tests now coming up if this is a problem for you though it is a red flag and it want to work on if you we we move on to our next exercise here or test and it what we what is your anti-extension stability what is your ability to contract here through the abs and prevent an over-extension of the mid-section because that is dangerous that actually places a high amount of stress on your lumbar spine it and it stabilize in a plank with your hands out here in front of your body you want to be able to stabilize for as long as your body can get and especially as we apply this to athletes and wide receivers if somebody is weak or vulnerable in this position here especially as they going up for a catch like let antonio brown you want to make sure that you can do this and hold this position here for at least 30 seconds with your arms up over your head and your abs firmly stabilized if you cannot guys if you find that you sagging or you pressure in your low back you strong enough you address this before you can move on if you rotational stability and last you want to make sure that you can prevent unwanted rotation we can do that here with a cable setup all you have to do is put about half of your body weight on the cable step away with your hands close to your chest now extend your arms out away from your body all the way as straight as you can make them you increasing the moment arm you increasing the weight you the demand of the core and you at all costs to prevent rotating even an inch back towards the machine itself you want to make sure you can hold this position for 10 seconds each time and try to repeat it for a total of two to three times in each direction to make sure that you have the ability to prevent excessive rotation if you don once again is a red flag so there you have it guys there are five red flags to help you to determine if you have some ad weaknesses that you going to want to address because i promise you guys it to overlook them or shove them under the rug and think that one day you them it them you face them head-on you do something about it right now the fact is guys you might even have visible abs that is not an indicator of whether or not you don weaknesses because it your abs look like from the outside in it what their strength is from the inside out that matters the most if you looking for programs that help you to do this and build it into everything we do because we know how important it is all of our programs are available

Lower Ab Exercise Mistakes (REVERSE CRUNCH!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhrkw1aaP8k	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com so today I you the right way to do a reverse crunch because the reverse crunch is a great lower ab bottom-up movement to help us develop those lower abs better if we do it the right way you see there of ways to do the reverse crunch you can do it with straight legs if you do with bent legs which is the best way to do it let let me show you some of the ways that you probably either have done them yourself or see others doing them right here I actually one of the more common ways that you actually the worst way to do it because you easiest at what hardest point in the range of motion when you get to the very very top we call this the heels to the heavens you really should be trying to press your heels right directly up into the ceiling but if you allow your heels to go past that point past vertical to point where they guys now gravity is actually helping you it direction and taking all the work off of the ABS so you want to definitely stop it vertical in terms of how far back you go if you want this exercise to stay with the focus on the lower abs next to see a whole hell of a lot of momentum being used in this exercise because we have the opportunity to rock on our own tail bones rock on our pelvis and get a lot of momentum going in that backwards direction the goal here guys is never again with ab work or anything else it not just to reach a certain numbers to do it the right way so even if you cut down your rep significally by doing this the way I gonna get better effort out of your abs and that the first place so you don this extreme lamenting that I you here when I weight of my legs back allowing it to help me get back up and then actually not controlling them at all as they work their way back down towards the ground in both cases not something you want to do the next thing you shortening of the legs and this happens a lot just as an automatic compensation because remember our bodies are smarter than we are we easy way out when you challenge yourself and change yourself and ain the easy road out well if I show you here well about you I bring my feet up towards the top everything looks good but when I lower my legs back down to the ground because I don weight of my legs against gravity I can shorten them I can shorten them by just bending at my knees now there much weight having to be controlled against the force of gravity so let just say my legs weighed 50 pounds apiece now they might weigh 25 pounds apiece because we distance of how much is exposed to the force of gravity so it makes it a lot easier for us then when we get back down to the ground we automatically think we straighten the legs out and then lift up again probably using some more of that momentum if you want to make this really really effective you maximize the length of your legs all the way back down or as I the next step maybe not all the way down but at least get them as long as you can possibly make them by making a concerted effort to straighten out contract your quads make your legs as straight as it can be to increase the amount of weight that your lower abs will have to handle and lastly picking up on that point I just referenced maybe sometimes you don to the ground because there different challenge that your abs face when you try to keep it closer to the contracted position think about it what to try to get some stress off of your abs therefore letting it go all the way back down till it position really but if we keep it in that contracted position now it of a full-on onslaught of contraction here that we have to be stronger and able to be it to be able to control it so here you can see that by shortening the amount that you allow your legs to travel back down towards the starting position we can make this even harder try it yourself don let your legs go back down to the ground and instead try to stop the downward momentum reverse that with another strong contraction of your abs to get them right back up again to the top you a plyometric version of an ab exercise because you that eccentric phase back to the concentric phase again shortening that amortisation phase that they have which is that transition between the two do a little bit of that I it feeling that you ever used to especially on this movement so as you can see guys there there the wrong way the wrong way if you want to get the most out of the time that you spend doing the exercise and I think that should always be our goal here if we try to work a little bit harder we can actually shorten the time that we spend doing that whatever workout we doing because we can get more out of it a lot of guys shy away from that they think that if they just put in the time that that will equal the results that they want but that effort will never be anything that you can overlook effort is everything and if you don effort that you to shortchange the results that you see hopefully you you can take from this to apply more effort in your training and hopefully you all the workouts that I give you guys matter of fact our entire athlean-x training program shows you how to extract the most effort that you in the shortest period of time so I can guarantee that you get the best results possible you can get that guys in our athlean-x training systems that promise to you I will do my best to get every ounce of effort out of you to get the most that you you can do that again at athleanx.com in the meantime if

Stop Doing Abs Like This! (SAVE A FRIEND)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMBLUjJblM4	ATHLEAN - X	what athletenext.com so today i show you some things that i want you to stop doing when you matter of fact this is one of them and if you are looking at this right now saying i don wrong with that then even more of a reason why you tuned here and watch what i show you now these kind of mistakes are actually being made across every single gym every day i guarantee you to see people doing these things good thing is after you watch this video you won you the good information so you can actually help out a friend so let your abs right now we with the first thing you need to stop all right the first thing you want to make sure that you speeding through your reps guys i you this in the gym all the time and some people will say that they have to do them this fast to prevent their body from swinging during let leg raise that is is they putting all of the effort everywhere but on the wraps and all i care about is high quality repetitions if you accumulate more high quality repetitions the number of repetitions you do will not matter and when it comes to your abs you want to make sure that the focus is coming from and deriving from the area you you see me do a hanging leg raise it doesn like this this is one where i trying to make the abs do the work and as i come up slow i curling the pelvis under flexing the trunk making the abs do the work and i can take it down to the floor as well and more of a beginner exercise we can still screw these up guys pump their way through these like they going out of style i don you go i only care about accumulating one good rep at a time and i promise you if you start to do the same thing your results will be significantly better alright this next one up is actually one that might have tripped a few of you up in the beginning of the video and that is do you know what exercise it now i don there and if you do it deliberately and slowly yeah you from it but there more wrong with this there this is not a full range of motion repetition and for some reason when it comes to ab training we fall in love with cutting short the repetition distance you can go back to the hanging leg raise go back and look what do people normally do they just pump their legs in that mid-range they don that full range of motion so get your legs all the way down go through that full trunk curl just like i thing when you the ground go all the way to the ground let the abs actually extend or at least get to neutral with your back on the floor don position there motion as it is on a crunch when you take half of it away you are really really minimizing the type of results that you can see from your training so do me a favor guys start to elongate and be more conscious of the full range of motion on all ab exercises and i promise you right this next one is actually one that i it bears repeating because it very important especially to the type of look that you abdominals if you do this wrong and that is screwing up your breathing see we not just rushing through repetitions and abbreviating them to get them done as quickly as possible but we probably holding our breath or breathing entirely backwards you see when you do an ab exercise like this floor crunch you don you don sticking out your belly at the same time you do want to exhale as you come up into a repetition we know that but as you exhale you actually should be trying to bring your belly down and in and you do that by activating the muscle called the transverse abdominis and guys we know that it around our waist this way and it acts to cinch down sort of like the stomach vacuum idea right pulling it down and flat as you engage in doing a repetition you want to feel as if you can bring your stomach down and flat while you breathe out so while it be breathing out and blowing out at the same time so and blowing like that and a lot of guys will do that and all that really teaching poor muscular control in the abdominal area so you don that you want to make sure that on every single repetition of every exercise that you that cinching down or tightening effect of the transverse as you exhale and i promise you again not only a better execution of the exercise but a better look and end result of all the repetitions you right this next one actually gets really under my skin because i hear it far too often and a lot of people who are trying to train their abs will do so but skip their obliques because they that training their obliques is going to make them blocky guys please stop doing that as a matter of fact if you do one thing make sure you do train your obliques and i demonstration before your obliques when covered with fat will tend to look blocky but when you obliques at a lower body fat level are revealed they actually do an incredible job of tapering the entire waistline down and actually giving you that v-cut look that a lot of guys will talk about wanting so the idea is this you got to start training your obliques but more importantly you got to be very conscious of how you activate them and it kind of goes back to the original point in this video and that performing every single repetition you do don okay i obliques or don crunches and think that you your obliques because people tell you that they twisting be more conscious of what you do if you do something more advanced like this remember it just trying to execute this rotation from the obliques they you can literally see them starting this movement every single time i go from right to left and right to left i want you guys to become more aware of that but overall big picture i don what oblique exercises you sure you guys the end result is going to be much better if you do and last but not least guys when it comes to what you for your abs and maybe what you shouldn want you to remember is to include at least a little bit of calf work and some jaw work that because the next time you about maybe pulling off into a mcdonald your damn foot down on the gas pedal activate those calves and drive past it as fast as you possibly can and the next time you kind of think about eating something you know you shouldn keeping your damn mouth shut so you don because guys nutrition is that critical i promise you the results of your hard work will never be seen unless you commit to eating better behind the plate and what you put in your mouth it very critical and i can that enough so when you think about the type of ab exercises or even all the tips that i just showed you here and what you become infinitely more effective if you could commit to the thing that i know is the most challenging and that is becoming more aware what you eat guys it doesn can literally eat things that you like and i because there stick to this long term if you don find a plan that allows you to eat the way you like matter of fact we actually have plans like that all over at athletenext.com included in all of our programs i make it simple i make it realistic i make it something you can actually follow not just for a few days but you can follow for life guys the same way that i eat now for years and years and years to stay at the body fat levels i do without any suffering without any deprivation because it won last long term all those are over athletics in the meantime if you found

Workout to Get Lower Abs Fast (7 MINUTES!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j22ncHwoRkU	ATHLEAN - X	so you better activation of your lower abs but you don thing that guys i follow-along workout that we going to be able to do what athletenext.com so when it comes to lower abs it tends to be that this is the area that to either show or even train them because there going on here when we talk about getting them to show yes nutrition as always when it comes to revealing your abs is a high priority and because men especially tend to store their fat here the longest it requires a higher dedication to good nutrition to be able to get them to show so you need to be more dedicated and more committed to what you enough body fat levels to start to see the lower abs but when we talk about the training side of it all of us suffer from the same thing here and that is lower ab movements are driven from moving the pelvis towards your shoulders well attached to that pelvis is a pair of legs that happen to usually weigh a lot so these become weighted ab movements that become very challenging and oftentimes it fatigued first limiting what you can actually do for your lower abs so that being said guys i have the perfect antidote here a workout that we follow along for beginner intermediate or advanced that drive those movements from the bottom up to hit the lower abs but includes that much-needed reprieve that allows you to keep going when other workouts might cause you to quit so the way this workout works is going to alternate those bottom up movements that are going to involve the weight of the legs the more challenging of them with the less challenging we call them hip flexor relief lower ab movements and we do this in a way that actually accommodates the different levels of ability if you bottom up movements for 15 seconds and you rest 15 seconds before moving on to the next exercise if you for 20 seconds with a 10 second rest and if you for 25 seconds with a 5 second rest now the hip flexor relief movement is going to again remove the weight of the legs all you is isolate the pelvis and move it and not worry about having the legs be the factor that weights you down or makes you fatigue too early so because these are slightly easier we aim to perform these for 25 seconds with a 5 second rest if at some point you feel like you here you can take a quick rest and try to get back into it but the fact is you go for as long as you can in that 25 seconds as far as a specific exercise sequence we start here with the figure eight and what we just get that pelvis lifted off of the ground but we bottom-up rotation so you get some of the obliques working with the lower abs to drive the movement we move on to that first hip flexor relief exercise which here is called the lower abs swipe and what you you got your tailbone and pelvis off the ground by being able to swipe your hands underneath make contact with them without touching or feeling your lower back right because it ground high enough to allow you to do this we come out of that move and we move into our third exercise back to the more challenging lower ab exercises and that is the bicycle v up here we legs and trying to sit up into that v position again the weight of the legs is going to make this more demanding and more likely to fatigue out your hip flexors so that means we need a little bit of relief which brings us to our fourth exercise and that is the heaven press and here all you simply press your heels into the ceiling again lifting and driving by just trying to get your tailbone and pelvis off the ground not worrying about anything else the fifth exercise is going to be this three-way seated ab tuck and interestingly here we put this at the fifth spot because you have some additional assistance from your hands that will make this a little bit easier as you get to this point in the workout you more fatigued and then we wrap up here with our final exercise for hip flexor relief this is the kte crunch which stands for knees to elbow here you set up in a 90 90 crunch position and you do not move your elbows at all your upper body stays locked in place all you initiate that pelvic lift with the activation of that bottom up ab movement to drive your knees into your elbows so here we take this entire circuit which will be done in a matter of three minutes and we aim to complete it twice you take a one minute rest in between circuits for a total of seven minutes let i know you can do it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so there you have it guys in just seven minutes you now have a game plan to get better activation of those lower ab fibers by targeting them with the lower up movements at the same time addressing the fact that most lower ab exercises and workouts can over tax those hip flexors this is not going to be your problem and remember guys when you want to get this area to show you still have to have that commitment to your nutrition because we know that this is the last place to come off if you have a step-by-step plan that makes it easy to follow it easier do that we have all of our nutrition plans included in our

The ÂHoly TrinityÂ of Ab Training (HIGH DEFINITION!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d08B-QJL124	ATHLEAN - X	what the Holy Trinity of ab training yes Trinity three it ABS when you want the ABS to look better and certainly when you want them to perform better you got to learn to start incorporating more than just the ABS and today we muscle groups that want to work together and prefer to work together so it rectus abdominis the six-pack area the obliques and of course the Rus anterior also cuz all these muscles will feed in together and the cool thing is I can show you something you can do in one setup that areas in one shot okay now if you don have a captain worry about it you can do it in a corner of a kitchen counter where the counter meets just get in here and do exactly what I going to actually just grab on put one hand on each side of the kitchen counter or in this case if you have access to this you can use this or a set of dip bars now the first thing you want to do is position positioning of your shoulders you don shoulders sink down yet not the whole time because we know that if we get depression of the shoulder blades that we can get a little bit of activation of the serus Interior we more direct in a little sec in a second here but just by holding this demands more activation of these muscles and that start off with AB training with the ab exercise rectus and we know that you see people do this all the time okay but this is not what I want to see I don want to see your knees I don see your toes what I want to do is I mentioned this before on this channel I kind of want to see your ass so that means that you want to see that okay you want to see the the bottom half facing you and the reason why that is is because when the bottom half faces you I my bottom half my ass unless I my spine and tucking it in so we start off there and we rep out to failure the next thing we want to work on is the obliques so we know that we need to get rotation involved to do that well how do we do that come back up here again positioning not here but up okay lock it in we and then from there twist back and come up and across our body here boom here up up up up up up okay and of course we go other side down up twist and come up last one so we talked about the serus deep inside up in here feeding into the oblique so all those sort of obliquely oriented muscles that arranged on a diagonal that help to streamline the appearance of your whole core so we can do that those muscles are most active when we get protraction of the arm if I turn this way when the arm is here and then protracts away from the body okay that we Plus we push through we can do that change the orientation of your body get up top now allow yourself to dip down okay and lean forward from here you going to push up here and then lift your torso up and down sink in lean forward so we from our body up and push up up push up push up push up P up push push so down here and then pull the pelvis Up and Under okay so we working on that whole area up under here again trying to get the muscles that prefer to work together to work together I am caught this is the Holy Trinity guys not just because we want it to be but because your body actually prefers it to be that way stop training in isolation let your muscles work together at all cost if you program that trains you like an athlete and therefore let together that prefer to head to athletes.com and get our athex training program in the meantime if you found the video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below remember no excuses you can do this anywhere you don kind of special fancy equipment all right guys see you soon	Success
Body Fat for Abs to Show - The Truth! (MEN AND WOMEN)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wqXNZbnZEs	ATHLEAN - X	so what body fat level is actually required to see your abs after all today I is in a matter of fact it surprise a lot of you and I to tell you the best way to actually take action on that and get yourself down there no matter where you are right now what athleanx.com so one of the most popular questions I get from both men and women is is there a specific body fat level that I should try to get to if I want to be able to see my abs and I guess the reason why they ask that question is they figure if I can at least see my abs and maybe the rest of me probably looks pretty good too and well that might be a fair question I think the thing you need to ask yourself first is do you know where you you are not we and let York City but you Diego and I give me a lot easier trip for me so we have to know where we order to know where we how long it that there the things you can do is kind of invest in something that bit more expensive like a DEXA scan but it sophisticated results and information or you can do something like we do here with Jeff seams and that testing which is a little bit less reliable but a lot easier a lot of times less expensive or you can do it I always like to do so that we did ten years ago on my blog and it the eye test by the way I know they helpful but if you your channel and not even give us credit so what these charts show you is a couple things number one they easily allow you to identify with a picture as a representative example not an exact example but a representative example of what it might look like at a given body fat percentage so you can say yeah I kind of look like that right now but they also help you to identify visually where you want to be or where you want to get to and importantly here guys it important to point out that the answer to the question that we started with was what specific body fat level do I have to get to this is where the encouraging news comes in it particular body fat because you can see here that the range even on the guys side here to actually have ABS visible even a little bit like the top row of ABS over here is somewhere in the 1617 percent range and it goes all the way down to the most extreme the same thing here for women it large range you can be from unhealthy to a much more healthy range but still be able to see your abs but depending upon what body fat level you aspire to it change the level of commitment and dedication you probably discomfort and all-out hatred of the path if you choose the wrong one because if you sit all the way over here first of all not only is this unobtainable and healthy for the long term but you need to be so dialed in here and pretty much be just north of dead to be able to sit at this body fat level for any in sustainable period of time so we want to start to veer towards these other healthier ranges the idea though is it becomes a lot more forgiving in terms of your lifestyle you don your nutrition in terms of being dead not accurate every single day day after day after day cheat meals become a thing of reality as you start to veer more towards these as your ideal in what you is going to be heavily influenced by what body fat level it is that you looking to get to now the next thing we though is something called the training effect in other words if you to train your abs along your way to your goal there is a difference in the level who are ability to see your abs at higher levels because we can see right here at a roughly nine percent body fat a much leaner individual here there not a lot of visible ab definition here probably because there training going on here on the other hand though this gentleman here too substantially higher body fat probably fifteen or sixteen percent as much better ab development because he is training his abs directly so there something you want to make sure you aware of if you have a willingness to just add some direct core training to what you ability to have those abs pop at even a higher body fat level so the next question becomes then how do you get there right there in only three ways one you could just do nutrition alone two you can just try to train or three you can combine nutrition training you guys know me by now you know I answer is always gonna be nutrition and training because we know you tried it in the past that just taking a nutrition approach is really just about adopting a diet which is a short term approach that doesn to even keep off whatever it is that you do lose and then you have the guys that want to just train and they show up with the gym and there once they leave the gym for the other 23 hours of the day and what they actually put in their body and that doesn results either so you learn how to combine both of them and here getting the training effect that we already talked about which has a direct impact on the visibility of the ABS but you of the training with the nutrition because you in the gym burning more calories which gets to add to the overall caloric deficit you nutrition changes so the rate and the speed at which you of where you want to be is going to be dramatically affected by the combination of both in the most positive way let me show you exactly example of how this actually plays out I started break this all down we need to do just a little bit of math but it so the 200-pound man at 30% body fat that wants to get to 10% body fat so we know that 30% of his weight right now is body fat 60 pounds of fat wanted to get down to just 10% of that weight which is 20 pounds of fat so that means we gonna have to create an overall forty pound loss of fat well to get there we know that we want to kind of do this at a safe rate about one and a half pounds per week is a very conservative number I like to be conservative but it works so to do that we know a 500 calorie deficit through your nutrition cuts right by eating healthier it about a pound of fat loss over the course of a week roughly that numbers actually been disproven of late but it still close enough to get us on track 3,500 total calories over the week you add an additional 250 from here to get a pound that I have Jesse will you help me with the math Jesse with the calculator so if we want to get 40 pounds with one and a half per week how many weeks is gonna take us that no good buy it you math if I if I wanted to have twenty six point six point six if you want to get how many days that is multiply it by seven times one a six point six thank you so good at math I see 186 days it about six months guys and remember if you start here at 30% and you want to get here at 10% you spend 185 days looking like this and then on day 186 look like this you gonna get the added benefit of being able to look like this guy for a period of time and then this guy and then this guy and then this guy on your journey over here so you additional inspiration from your own results to keep you on track remember guys it as it looks but you do have to get started and the most important thing is that you get started having an idea of where you want to get to and if you want to be over here because that identify back in the beginning of this video then your journey is going to be even shorter faster and maybe even more enjoyable that all depends upon you and how committed you already wanted to be at a certain level Oh guys so there you have it the body fat level that you need to get to what is going on here Jesse 15 seconds to cover what took you what 50 minutes to cover in this video alright so first up if we me as the example to get after you lower body fat percentages I need to eat less time you bears do more squats not be obsessed with getting to his low body fat percentage is you because I mean you only have a six-pack and I that eight-pack and lastly instead of using calipers to measure my body fat you could just put me on the chart as a representative example of what perfection is perfection perfection did I miss anything you didn your abs judo part no I the baby shark ab challenge that it fact guys if you an ab training plan we actually have one

The Secret to \"Boxer\" Abs (FULL WORKOUT!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBJlJwvx8Xk	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com so let me ask you a question take a look at these three guys and you tell me what makes their midsections so impressive all right one by one first up martial arts legend Bruce Lee okay take note cuz I picture of him again in a second next guy famous boxer Manny Pacquiao again take a look remember it we at another picture of him in a second and of course my childhood fitness icon Sylvester Stallone here take another look good now I want to show you another picture of each of these guys again let happened he notice was not as impressive what Manny Pacquiao once again take a look what do you think what do you see and then finally Sylvester Stallone one more time the difference if I put these pictures now side-by-side is in one picture we actually see the development the true development of their serratus anterior a muscle that a lot of us overlook and then the other picture here we to take years away you want to make sure you possible because you can see that when the serratus interior is developed it actually starts the tapering effect down and feeding into the external obliques then which feeds into the ABS you want to have the best-looking midsection is going to rely on this fan like muscle that comes in here here here here and it feeds down right out of lat down in and guess what happens guess how we activate that muscle the most we activate that muscle the most from punching because it getting that shoulder blade around the body to wrap around so it kind of flipping your arm out like this but actually getting your arm extended as far as possible that gives us the ability to activate that muscle but you know what we can actually do that incorporate that into an entire ab workout and that here for you today I will not only take your arm through that protraction to get the mat and the major activation of that muscle to help develop it but secondly incorporate the ABS as well to have one complete workout okay let out here with a pretty basic exercise but we this is a plank but we activate the serratus interior and we could do it very simply by not just resting passively on our forearms but raising the bar a little bit and actually pushing through our forearms right we forearms in contact with the ground to push our body away and by doing so we getting that protraction and rounding of the shoulder blades around our body which is key as we talked about to activating the serratus now we overlooking the impact that this still can have on the ABS but what about this is we get that little one-two combo of incorporating serratus activity with the traditional rectus abdominus that we get from a plank next we can take one of my favorite ab exercises which is the AB wheel rollout dustier is off you can still use this thing I promise you guys it good but what we do is once again we focus on how we do the rollout a lot of us will just sink down into it and let it collapse on us know if you want to activate the serratus as well what you need to do is you that wheel out actively in front of you so I get up on top of it you can see me actually initiate first by pushing my arms down and lengthening them as far as I can and then holding that position because that that position the entire time then execute your roll out and come back in again there we nothing that we working the ABS all we adding to the fact that we activated the serratus on top of that now this couldn without actually throwing a few punches right we know that this is one of the best ways to activate this muscle and we can make it more of a core challenge just by varying the position of our body when we do this so I behind me and what I get the serratus activated is to push my hand out and even further right we reaching as far out in a way as possible so it but it can get the shoulder blade wrapping around but I mentioned the fee what going on down there well we narrow our base of support so that our core has to do more work to stabilize our body especially as we arm against the resistance of the band so you can see I feet and put them in line with each other in the back foot I on to a toe so I base of support and I the same time to make it more of a core challenge but as we talked about the band and the pushing out in and of itself it serratus as well this next exercise here is actually one of my favorites just overall and it something we call our gymnast ABS exercise and that is getting into a dip bar station here and then not just worrying about doing dips and not just worrying about doing knee ups but actually working on pulling our pelvis up into this posterior tilt which we know is going to activate the ABS but look what with my hands I the same time I hands in a way as far as I can really trying to round those shoulder blades and get them around my body to activate the serratus and we call this a screwdriver the screwdriver is a great way to incorporate not just the serratus and that the obliques involved as well sort of the Holy Trinity we say of ab training actually made a whole video on that if you haven at the end of the video but in the meantime it falls in perfectly here is yet another option to really hammer home this serratus and finally we have another popular ab exercise the crunch pulldown and not only do guys tend to do incorrectly but I think in this case they opportunity to include the serratus in this move and it changing the position of the rope in relation to your body when you the exercise most of us will take that rope right in front of us and go straight down and crunch but why not turn your body around if we have the rope anchor behind us and we pull that weight stack we reach now we the serratus activated against the resistance here of the stack and then from there then we execute the crunch pull down we activate of the entire time we incorporating again the ABS through every single exercise here the rectus abdominus is getting a great workout when we mentioned in the beginning serratus feeds into the external oblique which feeds right down into the rest of the rectus abdominis so these muscles prefer to be able to be engaged together we here finally for the FIR time so there you have it guys there is your complete workout do each of these exercises focus mostly on the quality of every repetition if you find that you losing the ability to contract your serratus slow it down get a good quality rep and if you can that a rest move on to the next try to go through two or three rounds of this if possible guys I want to look like an athlete you got to Train like an athlete you can muscles that matter the serratus not only does it look good and does it help all those guys that I showed you in the beginning to have an entirely impressive core and even if you it terms of shoulders stability and keeping your shoulder moving right especially if you move it up over your head right these are all things that matter we overlook none of it when it comes to our athleanx training programs if you looking for a program that tells you how to do all this step-by-step head over to athleanx.com in the meantime if you haven and turn on those notifications so you never miss a video I told you I one of those videos here at the

How Strong Are Your Abs (TAKE THIS TEST!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n_ZLU7q6w0	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com let me ask you a question how strong are your abs and I mean really how strong are your abs not measured by the fact that you can make it through a hard ab workout or that you can maybe do an ab exercise that a lot of other people can truly determining whether your abs are strong it might be that you have strong hip flexors and then your abs are actually being dominated by that and they a quick test that you can do today without anything no equipment right here on the floor that you can do right now and see where you simple you have to land the ground you test you here and establish a flat back by doing the flat back position and keeping it maintaining it you abs right to do a posterior tilt we have to activate and engage our ABS well the stronger more dominant hip flexors will try to pull us into anterior rotation and especially we can hold our hip flexors static here by holding our legs now and that might mean we have strong hip flexors but if we hold a posterior tilt to counteract the weight of our legs well then we know we also have strong ABS too so that testicular measure you flatten your back you take your thumbs like this you try to point them into your back you try to connect them underneath your back the only way they if you go into an anterior tilt so if I demonstrate right here I go to anterior tilt no space I can actually get this whole hand over to this side so we don want any space so gonna have a completely flat back to make sure those abs are engaged the whole time so you point your fingers in to your sides in your low back you raise your legs up at 90 degrees from here you want to see as you progressively lower your legs down can you withstand the weight the increasing weight of your legs against gravity by maintaining that posterior pelvic tilt because of the strength of your abs so I most people should be able to do this really easy I lower down slowly to about 75 degrees if you find that you cave here you can that into your tilt for that drop of the pelvis you might have some problems that would be a pretty weak set of abs if you already lose it at 75 degrees use that move down to 45 degrees this is a matter of basic score if you can keep and maintain your posture to this point but at this point you fall and you fail well that come down even lower down to about 30 degrees the better score it perfect okay it from here we go down just above the floor now we legs against the full force of gravity pretty much but again I get to be able to break that pelvic posterior tilt into interior tell us I when here after you seconds can you reverse the direction so now I go back up to 30 without the loud in my pelvis to break it to an interior tilt and from here can I go up to 45 and then from here back up to about 70 should get easier now and then back up to 90 it that you break that determines the strength of your abs here thing about this test if you break in those high positions without having gone down very low that can become your exercise that can become your strengthening stick within that range get right to the range where you break and back off get right to the range where you break and back off and perform it in reps if you can get all the way down and all the way back up you can see you can make this much harder because of the whole time under tension principle is you can actually do these much slower and slower so yeah you might be doing leg lifts just train your abs let start doing them under this kate is two seconds down two seconds down two seconds down controlling it every single step of the way is you can turn that into a ten rep killer just by doing that one set so there you go guys there quick way to test your abs and even a follow-up way to train them based off of the results of that test if you find that you still need some work guys we have a complete set of ab workouts and a tax as a matter of fact in our athlean-x training system we buried the a broke ass every single day and have unlimited out workouts because of the shuffle feature built-in if you haven already head to athleanx.com get our 90-day training program we train your whole body entire body we obviously get the ABS to show but giving you the nutrition plan we will also train them like an athlete each and every day with all new workouts every single time guys I meantime if you found this video helpful make sure you leave a thumbs up and some comments below whatever else it is that you want to see we weeks ahead see it	Success
Best Abs Exercise Ever (THE WINNER!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9v8zrMD1Qbg	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what know I said it the best ab exercise ever but you know me by now I wouldn to a gunfight with a knife I came with the evidence of why I feel this is the best ab exercise ever and of course it has to meet the criteria for being called the best ever first and foremost this is a groundbased movement I like when you can get a closed chain environment you can keep your feet on the ground in this case I got my hands and my feet on the ground as opposed to hanging from a bar number two this ab exercise is one that is scalable meaning I will show you variations that allow the rank beginner to try this and the most advanced guy the guy with the strongest core ever number three I allow this exercise to be performed anywhere I this in the gym or if you even better I you can do this with nothing but a pair of socks and then finally this ab exercise meets the all important criteria of targeting those areas of your core that often times get overlooked or more importantly do not get trained together forget the isolation ab movements guys if you want to train your core you better do two things you better learn how to integrate as many muscles in the core together at one time as possible this will do that and number two you better learn how to train for stability and not strength because the primary purpose of your abs is not to be strong the primary purpose is not to be able to Crunch an entire weight stack in a weighted crunch machine more importantly you better be able to hold an entire weight stack on your back through a stability exercise this is a stability exercise that will do everything that it needs to do so with that being said let a look at the progression okay first of all this exercise is a variation of the plank but for those that tell you oh planks is all you need to do no you not going to cut it that way because there your stability not when people can break world records and do planks for hours and hours on end you have to be able to still provide the challenge and we can do that by moving our limbs in space that is going to provide a dynamic challenge for the stability of your core right stability is only challenged when you have other things that are moving so we get in this plank position and now we we aim to just pull our knees in towards our chest now we abs here because we bottom up movement now this is really easy and I said you can do this in the gym if you importantly and as you can see even as I rotate that importantly let practical environment if you at home you can just flip off your shoes hit a hardwood floor a tile floor any slick Floor come down to the ground and start banging out the same exercise now I talked about scalability we can scale this back for beginners maybe you can hold a plank and then also pull your knees in because you just don lower ab strength to do that it problem what you can do is drop down to your knees as you pull in and then when you slide your legs back let the legs actually lift themselves off the ground when they run out of room to slide so you a semi Plank and semi assisted plank here on the knee pulling you can do that now again back to the be the more advanced version of this you don pull out maneuver here that to be challenging either because one of the other components you always want to try to incorporate into core training is rotation so now you with a rotation to the left or rotation to the right or of course alternating back and forth but you know that even really going to keep me satisfied because I want to make it even harder than that so we can add our Serpentine variation to this and this is an exercise I want to show you the progression here on the single exercise so you can you find a way to challenge yourself at any level and the serpentine one now adds a much more Dynamic stabilization uh requirement for your core then finally we can say hey let the ability of moving our bottom towards our top but let bottom away from our top and that puts us right squarely here into the really hard versions here which is a cliffhanger plank that dynamically okay so now we our legs out behind us and trying to extend out into this Cliff Hanger this the ability to hold your plank here and the stability required here just shot off the charts but that is what do the things that challenge you but of course I can make it even harder for you what do we want to get in here rotation so what we do is we push ourselves out into the Cliffhanger and we rotate at the same time and this is the Cuda gr now I ultimate ab exercise here the variation that is challenging to you in this sequence that that is the ultimate ab exercise and that should be performing and as you get better and stronger then the next one you should be doing is the next hardest in line I hope you guys found this helpful you know these are the ab exercises that help to carve up the midsection that you want remember you got to hit every single area of your core if you want a complete midsection and we help to do it in the athletex training system I don valuable component of core training as a matter of fact it list of importance when it comes to training like an athlete so I never miss a beat here and I make sure you don either in any of our programs you can find them over at aex.com in the meantime if found this video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below tell me what else you want to see me cover here on this channel and I my best to do that

Abs Genetic Test (GET YOUR RESULTS!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE6IldfFtc4	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com you today what your fate is do you have the potential to have an 8 pack I show you today a simple test that you can do to determine it ok I either make your day or ruin your day or hold on for that though the test all you have to do is take your hands now I have I get it I don pulling on here you might have look if you have a big bunch of stuff here that you can this test may not be applicable to you I is where we should start doing this test ok so what you do is you with your fingers like this ok grab on and hold on to whatever you can grab right about the level of your belly button ok then when you stand if you want to stand here if you crunch down on like this when you going to be as effective you stand up now you tighten your abs ok you pulling away with your hands that way and you pull them that way ok when you do that you should feel the muscle pull away from the skin and into fat and everything else ok and then with your fingers being able to be pointed inward you should start to strum your fingers believe me this is going to work strum your fingers over the muscle that underneath there and see if you feel underneath the belly button at the level of the belly button down below see if you feel a ridge see if you feel a bump see if you feel some sort of Ridge that runs left to right across your body if you don potential have an eight-pack if you do then you have the potential to have an eight-pack so what does this all mean well in all honesty absolutely nothing because the vision of the visible abs that you have whether you have a four pack or six pack or an 8 pack it really the number that you have there is the fact that you have the ability to see what you have there and you have a completely developed core meaning not just the ABS which you have the obliques to frame it out and you can get a visibly impressive core so here we with a marker okay so start from the top down as I said you have the first two labs start underneath the chest and there line that comes right down here now me interestingly I actually had my appearance of this change a little bit after my second hernia just got a little bit less deep I got more more shallow here but this comes across here then I have the next row right here again this got a little wide it diastasis recti where you get a little bit of a spreading here again due to a due to herniation but that coming in here like this and then the last row comes down here and you can see that it runs to the level of the belly button underneath here in here okay now if I were to go and apply that test to myself here and rub my fingers across this area underneath that last pack here I could pull this down as much as I want that could rub my finger here there area I don there what is causing this what is that connective band that runs across that rectus abdominus into its areas here it don who does Jesse punch come on that other side of the camera so now here I am Jeff kitchen Jesse trying to get on it and he comes out and he rips out with this so the kids got one two three to the lower belly button no no what for all the way down here so Jesse gets an 8 pack when he goes out there here now it he he actually has this line you can feel I don I just going down the slope I can feel this Ridge I can literally pluck it like a guitar string right here that Ridge is what out develop and make a visible eight-pack when he continues to get his body fat level down now what is the difference because his oblique development isn there yet it doesn this right he but like as far as a midsection this will look more defined than then as a whole than what this would look like right so an obsession on just four versus six versus eight is ignoring the main point that there can do to develop whatever it is that you do have and look really really damn good in the process so stop obsessing about that and if you want further sort of uplifting motivation look at some of these other guys that didn have eight packs okay this guy right here you probably recognize I think his name is Arnold he actually maybe he has arguably like a five pack he had four and then one that kind of led down underneath the belly button there but it didn okay he looked pretty damn good in Franco Columbu his buddy again we looking or talking about eight packs or even the guy that was known for being aesthetically almost perfect Frank Zane again you packs but the concept is this they all look good and you can look good too if you don start getting discouraged because I did this test and I couldn little band there so what get your body fat level down and work on what you do have here everybody showed you about the genetic test for the biceps if you could fit two fingers in here supposedly you forget all that nonsense genetics exist but they will never place you in a category that says you have no potential to look good that is completely false if you develop what you have believed in what you have and work hard you to be able to look great like Jesse I could not I knew a little son of a [\\xa0__\\xa0] I can I don guy that lays out a nutrition plan that will set up the stage for you to get your body fat level down low enough so you can see whatever you have here head to athleanx.com

Top 5 WORST Ab Exercise Mistakes!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIc661Wfnf4	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com today we five biggest ab exercise mistakes and let about ab exercise mistakes because there first and foremost because if you to this channel then you need to hear this and if you you already know this guys you need to get your nutrition and check if you ever want to see your abs because your body fat levels will always determine whether or not we can see them however these five exercise mistakes are going to dictate how good your abs will ultimately look so let them alright big exercise mistake number one is cheating on your ab reps what am I talking about you guys know because I know and I even done them myself when you crunches have you ever tried to pull on your neck if you did I you eyeballs think that your shoulders are actually off the ground and they we know that when we crunches here we need to get our shoulders off the ground and not trying to trick ourselves into thinking that we pulling on our necks and when we do our lower ab exercises have you ever tried to just swing your legs up and start counting the reps away thinking that hey I way guys the only ones that ever matter are the meaningful reps that you actually contracted to bring up there and even sometimes we try to work with our hands and we the floor trying to get our legs up higher again what are we doing here we not our lower abs guys start caring more about the quality of the repetitions and stop caring about how many you and your abs will respond I have exercise mistake number two is not breathing properly during your ab reps what am I talking about I actually made a whole video on this before about leading to bloated abs you can actually start bloating your abs by not properly breathing on every rep if you are exhaling that the same time you stomach that want to try to do is learn how to exhale while not blowing out or pushing out on your stomach so there you want to learn how to exhale as you tighten down and make your waist smaller and tighter and we can do this on every single ab exercise you just might have to focus a lot more you can see me doing a crunch here I and pushing out at the same time what I blowing out but at the same time pulling in and tightening down on my stomach this makes a big difference into how your abs will look over the course of time when you add up rep after rep after rep you transverse abdominus stabilize and then do the movement and that dividends I promise you as you add up all the reps that you all your ab training your ab exercise mistake number three is not including enough hanging ab exercises and ab work why guys they always say if it doesn challenge you it won know that hanging ab exercises are more challenging but that is because they more capable of changing you start doing more of these exercises here reason why first of all anybody who ever had any kind of abdominal surgery could tell you and I with 200 operations I could tell you this hanging from a bar is so damn hard if your abs aren requires a lot of stabilization just to hang there and if you you might want to just start doing that hanging from the bar for a minute or so to start training your abs to contract and stabilize your body but of course if you challenge you want to start doing more exercises from this position and again like I said the last point here you stabilizing your pelvis first and then contracting from there and it becomes a lot harder but at the same time we positioned perfectly for lots of lower ab targeted movements here because we moving from the bottom up and all it takes is a little bit of a tweak and change the direction and turn and twist of the knees to really start incorporating not just the lower abs but the obliques as well yes these hanging exercises are more difficult but as I said they will start to pay more dividends for you in the long run so start looking for ways to incorporate more of them into your training moving on our fourth mistake here not training your abs enough guys I proponent of frequent ab training and I again I want to see you training your abs five times better six times even better maybe seven times a week frequency is what your abs are built for and as a matter of fact we hear a lot of times people say well I my ab training in through my other bigger lips because we know I have to stabilize during a squat and I have to do it during a deadlift guys it it you well you should be thinking about is how much better could my squat be and how much better could my deadlift be if my abs are stronger and we there by doing more frequent direct ab training I don to run faster jump farther jump higher or push something with you more with more strength your abs are gonna be the center point for generating all that power and you want to train them directly start training them not long 4 5 6 7 8 minutes that be more consistent with it and start doing it every single day if you can and I promise you your fifth and final ab exercise mistake is doing just that thinking only about your abs and not taking advantage of the opportunity to include all the other muscles of your core I in another video before called our ab training Trinity the Holy Trinity of ab training and it wasn abs but it also was about your obliques and more importantly your serratus and all these muscles function together if you allow them to and train them too and I give you a whole bunch of exercise options to do that will link to it again at the end of the video but the bottom line is this guys you can do more by including more muscles that like to work with your abs another perfect example stabilize from the bottom up have you ever tried to include your adductors yes those muscles on the inside of your thighs when you you haven instead of doing a regular windshield-wiper ab exercise squeeze your thighs together as hard as you can and then do the exercise you that you can contract-- your abs a hell of a lot harder just by doing that why is that true because you the pelvis from down below the ABS will grab onto the pelvis from the top down if we can get it from both sides we have a really intense contraction here and now we want to move and control that pelvis side to side on that exercise you can do this on almost every single exercise that your legs are in a position to be squeezed together so start taking advantage of it so there you have it guys the five biggest ab exercise mistake and of course the big warning in the beginning about that nutrition it do it don you that also includes daily nutrition to make sure that you can get ripped in stay ripped year-round head to athleanx.com and check out our athlean-x training system in the meantime if you haven do it and turn on your notifications so you never miss a video and as promised guys the Holy Trinity about training I gonna link up here for you you want to check that out alright guys I see you

Bruce Lee Ab Workout for a 6 Pack (DRAGON ABS!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQe3wUNk2Yc	ATHLEAN - X	What the legendary Bruce Lee in just 22 days. Now,\\xa0\\nlook, I know you I going to get from maybe this to that in 22 days?\\xa0\\nWell, step by step and with consistency. And that\\xa0\\xa0 is the plan here. Guys are going to do this plan\\xa0\\nliterally for the next 22 days. It it the exercises that Bruce Lee actually used to help\\xa0\\ncarve out a six pack. But it also helps, you know,\\xa0\\xa0 to try to eat like Bruce Lee, because we know\\xa0\\nthat nutrition is a huge part of whether or not\\xa0\\xa0 you he actually abstained from alcohol. Now, maybe you\\xa0\\ncan then, but you want to cut it down if you can. \\nBecause the less consumption of alcohol,\\xa0\\xa0 the less empty calories, but the better chance\\xa0\\nyou He actually didn eat carbohydrates, but he got rid of a lot of the\\xa0\\nfried foods and junk foods. As a matter of fact,\\xa0\\xa0 there are stories about him going to McDonald is because he didn it twice a year. They don it he didn ever get rid of carbohydrates entirely from your\\xa0\\ndiet either. Just eat them more responsibly. So,\\xa0\\xa0 with that being said, what are the exercise? How\\xa0\\nare we going to stack together this workout? Well,\\xa0\\xa0 there which is a number Or Till Exhaustion. And we did\\xa0\\nis we actually started with this exercise here\\xa0\\xa0 is called the Standing Elbow Twist. He did 25\\xa0\\nto each side or till exhaustion. So that means\\xa0\\xa0 that you and you can do 30 or maybe you can do 35, you\\xa0\\nwould go until exhaustion. However, if you were\\xa0\\xa0 to stop at some point on the way to 25, briefly\\xa0\\nregroup, take a breath and get right back into the\\xa0\\xa0 exercise until you reach 25 and then you stop.\\nDon and deliberate move. Get that good contraction\\xa0\\non your oblique to both sides 25 and when you do\\xa0\\xa0 you hit the ground. And the next exercise that he\\xa0\\nperformed here was called the Frog Kick. Now he\\xa0\\xa0 actually did a variation, both laying down and\\xa0\\nactually hanging from a bar, but the mechanics\\xa0\\xa0 are the same. You bring your knees in towards\\xa0\\nyour chest to shorten that lever arm and make\\xa0\\xa0 the exercise a little bit easier. And then you\\xa0\\nshoot them up in one motion up towards the sky.\\xa0\\xa0 You get a little bit of a pelvic lift off of the\\xa0\\nground to ensure that posterior pelvic rotation,\\xa0\\xa0 lower ab activation. You come back down, you\\xa0\\nstraighten the legs out, Again that of an isometric challenge for the lower abs. You\\xa0\\ncome back in and you keep going. And once again,\\xa0\\xa0 the number here was 25 or till exhaustion.\\nWe called the Single Leg Raise. And for this he\\xa0\\njust got back into this recliner position.\\xa0\\xa0 And from here you that contraction in your abs. Again, I call this\\xa0\\nsort of a mid-range movement because you have\\xa0\\xa0 both top down and bottom up activity going on\\xa0\\nat the same time, though, the top is actually\\xa0\\xa0 staying relatively stable. You really want to,\\xa0\\nas you did in the standing ab twist exercise,\\xa0\\xa0 really drive and feel the contraction from the\\xa0\\nbottom up. Don hip flexor. There your legs getting tired. If you do it the right\\xa0\\nway, you should feel your abs getting tired here.\\xa0\\xa0 You do this for 25 or till exhaustion.\\nAnd then we move into the next exercise. We sit up\\xa0\\xa0 a little bit, we do the Seated Elbow to Knee Tuck.\\xa0\\nAnd all you much more of that upper body involvement, right.\\xa0\\nIf the last one was more stable, now we both the top in the bottom working together in\\xa0\\nthe classic mid-range movement. And I trying to balance and maintain my stability\\xa0\\nup top because it see you but that fatigued yet. We move up the chain to the top down\\xa0\\nmovements as you get more and more fatigued.\\n\\xa0 Which brings us to the top-down movement, which\\xa0\\nis the classic full Sit Up. Now, whether or not\\xa0\\xa0 you want to anchor your feet under something\\xa0\\nor not, just be conscious of the fact that\\xa0\\xa0 you don I like to anchor my feet beyond something so that\\xa0\\nwhen I pull back, I which will shut the hip flexors off a little\\xa0\\nbit and allow me to make sure that the abs\\xa0\\xa0 are doing the work. Whatever it is, come all\\xa0\\nthe way up to the top lawyers up, back down,\\xa0\\xa0 keep that posterior tilt, keep that curvature\\xa0\\nof the spine so you which can be detrimental to your back. \\nAnd then wouldn the last exercise here is going to be the\\xa0\\nclassic Dragonfly. You might think to yourself,\\xa0\\xa0 there is no way in hell that I can do that\\xa0\\nexercise. Well, guess what? All you got to\\xa0\\xa0 do is a minute of it. And I don accumulate one minute before this workouts over.\\xa0\\nNow, if you do it with your legs out like I we can shorten that leather arm, bring the knees\\xa0\\nin and still try to get that floating effect\\xa0\\xa0 up a little bit and down a little bit, up a little\\xa0\\nbit and down a little bit. By doing this, guys,\\xa0\\xa0 you this so give it all you got. And I promise\\xa0\\nyou, you So, guys, if you found the video helpful,\\xa0\\nremember, leave your thumbs up below. Let me\\xa0\\xa0 know what you want me to cover and I looking for programs where we build in systematic\\xa0\\nab training with a purpose and progression,\\xa0\\xa0 it guys, if you haven never miss a new video when I put one out.\\xa0\\nAll right guys, good luck. See you soon.	Success
6 Pack Abs Nutrition (HOW TO EAT FOR ABS!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj_uWF62FwU	ATHLEAN - X	you what athleanx.com today we this is washboard Wednesday and we know that the kitchen is where those washboards begin it really revolves around how consistent you can be with your nutrition as I talked about in last week here that comes in two forms from me and it is 100% the reason why I can support a 6-pack 365 days a year and that is convenience in the kitchen you see I know as guys I that ii the convenience factor goes away like maybe their wife goes away for a week or so they anymore so if their wife does a good job of trying to keep them eating healthy ii they to either not eating good food at all or going out and eating crap it it makes them then all of a sudden lose all the effectiveness of their eating so for me convenience comes in two forms like I said and it prepare to eat well and I do that by stocking a lot of the stuff that I like to use all the time obviously for me I like cows milk guys you have you can you can also drink almond milk or cashew milk which I do drink as well but you can see there not running out the second that I run out of one gallon I don do I yogurt you know that I eat yogurt and it a ton of them in here okay I to just go buy one and then when I run out of that I have nothing else to use but more importantly here where I want you to focus on is the dish and this dish is pre-made this is we eat later tonight this dish as we can see I foods guys I got some sort of a green vegetable in this case it amount I tend to have it a lot and this is a hummus covered chicken now this chicken this pasta these sweet potatoes all this stuff was prepared ahead of time guys and not just that I get so lazy that I actually will make tomorrow I the pre-prepared meals just so that I don saw sometimes 9:30 10 o don together that late I already have one together for the next two nights so I don about it but the convenience comes in I so you see the stuff there well here we have the sweet potatoes that are just all prepared in one lump sum and then put into their individual Tupperware containers and again I it I doing any of that crap guys that convenient what Sunday for the entire week and there no budget concerns here if you don let to spend on food people will cry that the budgets don that chicken breasts here that you then prepare you can get chicken that has the the other parts attached to it that little bit cheaper because people have to do the labor to cut all that crap off to get to the breasts fine spend a little bit of extra time on that one Sunday to get rid of that crap but you price in the flexibility of let chicken which is not the only meat I eat but the flexibility this week of chicken is that it allows you to prepare it so many different ways so not just with the hummus on top but also we prepared like a mango salsa here that I can put on top of it as well or I could have I could make it with garlic and olive oil in tomato sauce for a completely different taste and of course all the different spices so that one I do want to show you one little Holy Grail take you guys behind the scenes a little bit just to give you an idea of how this is actually played out over the course of entire week okay so again behind the scenes I want to take you to the dungeon here this is in the basement but I want to show you how far I convenient nutrition available to me this freezer is a separate freezer that belongs to me down here in the basement but here what see that here are the already pre-prepared sweet potatoes that I have this is one two three four five another one two three four five that sweet potatoes right here on top of the two that I showed you upstairs here in all these Tupperware containers this is all lean steak and beef that I have prepared already frozen again fresh and then frozen right away and we have it in here I even have some couscous in different individual servings again it not about measuring those out that just about how much when I put it on the plate that follows the proportion have already discussed in previous videos but here I you know stocked full of pre-prepared meals and that that even if you have to get a little backup freezer to hold it the convenience is that I don worry about this food now for the next ten days and it potatoes I have enough options to grab and mix them up the point is that they pre-prepared I did that on one single day all right so the second thing when it comes to convenience guys you know how big I am a believer of supplementation when it comes to the convenience and the nutrition that they provide there there without an opportunity to supplement throughout the day because of the pure convenience of it and the fact that I know that when I exactly what I need so here there that I have no connection to at all just trying to help you guys out and that is the ninja the ninja Ultima blender my wife bought this watch how awesome this thing is when it comes to convenience so I take my rx 3 this is our nighttime protein for muscle recovery so what I do is I screw it right on just like this put it on top here lock it in place five ten seconds and what this is ready to go and drink so then what I here in the refrigerator so even this is ready to go for me for later in case I decide that I don because again sometimes late at night you don maybe somebody else in your house is sleeping so I do it I put it ahead of time right here and even that it make your nutrition can be you can follow a meal plan for as long as you want to follow it and if you foods that you actually enjoy and like which all of those foods on that meal plan that you saw there are foods that I actually enjoy it like it with our

Six Pack Abs (WHY YOUÂLL NEVER HAVE THEM!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7qBhMKvIiQ	ATHLEAN - X	what so am I talking to you that title I know you may not be talking to you you see if you and hard work only and actually having a respect for nutrition and what you put in your mouth and the fact that you are what you eat that I because you already know that that way that you get a six pack that you get abs abs are your visible badge of honor because you them the guys I guys that unfortunately have been LED down this path to believe that there are some magical formulas or shortcuts to getting abs and unfortunately guys we know where they all come from I feel bad for those that feel that way though because what they left disappointed and angry so how did this all start I did a video actually just yesterday for you on how to eat when you you fitness goals you you Temptations of poor eating when you out on the road and away from the Comforts of your own home one of the guys that commented on it and I just thought it was so great because I it comment it individual comment was okay so you basically told us that when we road to try to prepare ourselves and bring things that will will actually help us to be prepared and secondly look for healthy food options when we the road to summarize you right that do but guess what he told me to [\\xa0__\\xa0] off he me to [\\xa0__\\xa0] off in my life too that fine but he told me to [\\xa0__\\xa0] off because he was aggravated and angry because he said I what find what you leprechaun when you searching for that too give me tell me how that goes because there is nothing else the guys that are looking for secret formulas and have been conditioned to think that you can get a six-pack while you sleep and all that other [\\xa0__\\xa0] it down this road to frustration the sooner that you can direct your energies away from the search for what doesn and towards the facts that actually do and start applying that work towards your actual workouts and towards cleaning up your own nutrition and having a respect for what you eat then going to be much happier because you be that much closer to actually getting what it is you first place in this case it six-pack you know it can actually is required to get something done because we the thing that doesn of times guys want that thing to be elusive if it easy excuse for why you don why you can never grasp it because it too hard to obtain this is not hard to obtain but it takes dedication and it takes willpower and it takes a commitment to prioritize your Fitness over the other indulgences that lead you away from your goal for me as I said in that video working out and how I eat is part of what I do it but beyond that it it is my priority it it than I value some of the other things that other guys value does it make me better than anybody else hell no not at all not at all it priorities it someone else might value but telling me that discrediting what I saying that guys here watching what you eat and eating healthy foods and there choose from there choose from and our own athlete xfactor meal plan we you you Rabbit Hole of how to eat there many ways you can do it but it healthy it that approach you results but there there that that some magical trick that he has to go look in another video for because it doesn someone that tells you that guess what you just found the biggest bullshitter that you ever find because they bullshitting you to make you think that you found the secret and and this new way of eating and eating Doritos and Cheetos and hogen do and all that stuff is the best way to get a sixpack anybody that tells you that they and I can tell you they out for your best interest and they not giving you the right advice because that is not a long-term sustainable plan that is not how your body prefers to sustain itself and fuel itself that is not the answer the answer is unfortunately sometimes the boring answer but I answer that will work in the long term and have the most sustainability and and in this case when we nutrition we game we sustain something and eat a certain way forever it sacrifice yes the good is still riging to all this you might be the guy right now that will never have abs why because you do believe in all that nonsense but it doesn you believe what I you believe that there are some sacrifices that have to be made if you believe that hard work is required you can change your way you think if you believing in all those shortcuts stop it especially because you find yourself going from bouncing from video to video to video angry angry and angrier because the stuff that you tried didn slept all night you didn did all the things they told you to do you didn it up if you keep doing what you doing you you you can change your mentality and it can start right here with this video so most of my guys I know that watch they dedicated to hard work they commitment to to Fitness and a lifestyle of living a healthy lifestyle right we know that if you guys are there you guys are my subscribers and I get it the guys here are just pastors and passers by and stopping in for a video or so maybe I can change

RIPPED ABS - Beginner Ab Workout (5 Minutes!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYQrzZdlIL8	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com today i want to give you a beginner workout for abs now the key is that this is not your only workout right i just made a video not long ago where i talked about one of the biggest mistakes that you can make when you lose weight is to think that an ab only approach is going to get you there because we know that you need to have your nutrition in check in order to do that however if for a beginner you can commit to a five minute workout six minute workout like this one be here to at least get you going to start to build that momentum then it good thing but realize that you want to make sure that you something greater that you to work your entire body and not just focusing on the abs with that being said there are some key differences here between this beginner ab workout and some others that you may have seen because we want to make sure that we training you the right way to hit the right functions of the abs and not leave anything out so this will do exactly that and i we everything too so it makes it very very simple to track right so let me get down here the very first thing that you want to do is something we call a halo and the reason why the halos are good is that you so any movement where we take the pelvis and curl it back up towards the head is going to be initiated with a contraction down from the bottom portion of the abs so we want to make sure we start with that because that tends to be the weakest so we pick our legs up and then we going to lift and draw a circle so i trying to draw circles into the ceiling just like that so i lift i way down and around just like this is the circle now after 30 seconds i direction so now i draw circles in the opposite direction so 30 clockwise and 30 counterclockwise okay then what you want to do is you want to start getting your obliques involved now so you still want to stay bottom up because again you workout but you get the obliques involved by creating some rotation because they run down at an angle so what we do here is now we curl our pelvis off the ground and as we do twist the butt in one direction curl and twist the butt curl and twist the butt just like that so i lifting my pelvis from here to here off the ground lift twist and down so no hanging exercises hanging exercises tend to be a lot more difficult we the somewhat simpler versions here but still not uh negating the principles that i want you to follow here when it comes to training your abs okay great now the next thing is what we call a mid-range movement where we want to train the abs in both directions meaning stability from the top down and from the bottom up so that that entire mid-range and this is where planks become a good option however if you i because they challenging they too static we can make them a stability exercise but still have them become more dynamic by adding movement in and we could do that with a pendulum plank reach out so we get down in this position here and what we do is we start by pendulum uh making a pendulum over the lower legs so i step out here and back and step out and back out and back out and back that bottom portion but what we do is we add the arms in too so i step out back out back arm out back arm out and back when i go into this reach position here with the arm you can see that i the floor i limbs down four points of contact and made it temporarily three and even when i put the ham back down this elongated arm out here has increased the work that the abs have to do all right so i come back in so step out step out arm out arm out step out step out arm out arm out and keep that going for a minute each of these exercises so far has been done for a minute now we still want to have that rotation but this time from the top down so what we could do there is some exercise we call the chainsaw so you seen scissors before right you lift your torso off the ground engage the abs get in this position here and you just flutter your legs back and forth for a chainsaw we want to make it again more dynamic some more motion so what we do is we come down we lift engage up and then what we actually rotating our legs and our feet trying to keep our torso pointing straight ahead but all of our lower body rotating scissor scissor scissor scissor over there okay come on here a little bit more so scissor it and rotate it okay you go one minute of these now you rest as needed between these exercises depending on how much of a beginner you are you might need a little bit more rest if you can kind of keep cranking through them that would be ideal the less rest time you spend between ab exercises the better the overall effect and finally we do a sit-up roll-up now this is kind of a very important point here we end with our top down movement going from the top towards the bottom wide because we have more strength than any top-down movement and we because at this point they work out we seen a lot of people anchor their feet under something to do a sit up right and when they do they and pulling up they hip flexors which actually has a detrimental effect on the low back especially over time as you accumulate more and more reps so what you do is you find that same surface and instead you hook your feet beyond so now when the feet are beyond and you pull back you hamstrings which are on the opposite side of the hip flexors which can help to decrease the hip flexor activity therefore decrease the pulling on the low back it effect but the still the abs still have the same opportunity to be worked so with my feet anchored beyond that point what i do is i keep my arms up here and i curl up and when i important key here is to paint yourself back down i actually just covered this in a lower ab weakness video you want to be able to paint yourself down same way on the way up you want to unpeel yourself off the ground one segment at a time here and then on your way back down you engage and roll down one piece at a time roll off one piece at a time paint yourself back down one vertebrae at a time by engaging by getting into this flex trunk you already you flexors you there are no detrimental effects to exercises like this with sit-up or ab workouts in general and you can you complete this here for one minute so you see you minute a piece the idea guys is that if you a ranked beginner you could do this two times i workout if you are a beginner start here and like i said before i don where you beginner and this getting you on the ground and actually doing something that do more ab training alone is not going to get you the results you want pair it up with good nutrition pair it up with some good total body training now you going to really start to see the results of your hard work all right so guys i hope you found the video helpful if you lots of advanced training in our athletics videos as well make sure you check them out and if you one of those programs you can find them over at athenex.com we do have programs scalable to all levels of ability if you found the

Top 5 Ab Rollout Mistakes (FIXED!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTAVUqs0_m0	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com so today we a matter of fact the five biggest mistakes that people make when they use this thing because i have gone on record as saying i love this i actually do it for like 10 bucks you can get one at walmart and do wonders for your abs if you doing it right we got to cover the five mistakes to do that what do we always do we got to show the mistakes and for that we bring in the biggest mistake at athlean x jesse welcome to the video you want me doing things wrong again you once again one condition i want my new new new intro you got another new intro oh one word laser beams roll it all right cool so uh would you need me to do this i do with this honestly that intros finally no i can here i will tell you one more thing if you hundred ab rollouts you you can and correctly and do that many if you doing well you gonna come way down but the effectiveness is gonna go way up let the first one here is actually very easy to spot and more importantly to fix and it has to do with the position of our elbows you can look at jesse and i do them side by side here one of them hint is doing it wrong jesse and one of them is doing it right the fact is guys you want to have your elbows locked out straight because as soon as you have even the slightest bit of bend in your elbows you are transferring the workload away from the core and towards your triceps we don that if you from doing this exercise right it called an ab roll out we don tricep roll out and you have to just focus on making sure that your elbows aren but they us will start to fatigue as we perform the rep and have that break down don have to stop and reset for a second do so make sure the arms are out there you your straight arm scapular strength we channel by doing that because once you get your arms in this locked out position the leverage will favorably lend itself to creating more force and stability through the shoulder girdle which is going to transfer right into putting all the work being done where it all right so now speaking of using your arms guys it actually gets even worse than that what happens is when we get out to the end of the ab rollout how are you pulling yourself back in i going to tell you if you are someone who is doing the 100 reps i talked about before i know how you have an idea because i can see you doing it right now you your arms instead of letting your arms stay out there and initiating the pull from your torso look at jesse and i side by side once again you can see that once we get out there now the initiation of the return is where this all goes wrong for jesse at least because he starts to pull back in he literally trying to change the physics of the exercise in his favor by pulling that ab wheel closer to his body and then trying to initiate the trunk curl that if you don this properly then just don bastardize the movement by pulling it in halfway and then initiating the trunk curl you can see here for me when i get out there the first move is not with the ab wheel the first move is with the curl of the trunk i back and you can feel this guys just focus on once you come out there go to a dead stop if you have to and once you start to move again you start from here not at all moving the wheel back towards you and i promise you get this right as a matter of fact it gonna feed directly into the third and probably largest mistake people make that i now all right so the third one here is a big one as a matter of fact it popular mistake people make with the ab wheel and it of the hips when you exercise look guys you want to set up an imaginary line right at your knees and when you roll out and come back in you never want to cross it again with your ass if your ass crosses that imaginary line then your ass is in trouble because the exercise is being done improperly now i covered this before in a video in depth and i just recently reposted it here on instagram as you can see and this was picked up by men and talked about in depth in a recent article and why because it matters it very important so when you look at jessie and i do the exercise side by side you can instantly see that somebody abs than the other and i can give you a hint it ain the point is is that once you do what he you all the load off of the abs and you throwing it right on the hip flexors and our hip flexors certainly don the extra work what we sure instead that when the ab wheel gets closer it gets closer because you with a flexion of the trunk which is one of the functions of the abs we don bending through the hips and getting hip flexion which is what he the people that claim to do hundreds of reps for this exercise is simply because they they their knees with their ass don guys get out there and come back and keep it up almost like there right behind you and you can all the work is being done by your abs by staying in front of that imaginary line and not touching that wall with your backside so while we let the pelvis itself and what we want to do with it because it very important whenever you kind of ab training the position of the pelvis is key are you allowing your pelvis to go into anterior tilt or are you going into posterior tilt we should see just by the action here that when i go into anterior tilt i don stretching them out when i go into a posterior tilt i curling from the bottom up as opposed to the top down but we still creating spinal flexion so that means my abs are working well what you want to do anytime you do an ab roll out particularly if you want to protect your low back because a lot of people can screw up their low back if they get this wrong is you want to get into a posterior tilt and maintain that from the beginning to the end you can see jesse and i are doing something quite different here jesse positioning from the posterior tilt when he top and then when he reaches out mostly because he probably lacks proper ab strength in the first place to support that position when he elongated he drops down into a pretty severe anterior tilt that shifting back and forth between anterior and posterior tilt is placing a lot of excess strain and stress on your lumbar spine instead you can see me do it here where i posterior tilt at the top and as i roll myself out i maintaining a tight pelvis i rotated under i drop down into that anterior pelvic tilt and neither should you and finally guys number five why are you always going just straight out i know you probably learned the exercise that way but have you ever tried it differently because if you did you different in your abs and for the benefit of your abs because remember guys our abs though they do work in the sagittal plane and though i do tell you to follow the fibers we have also discussed how heavily used they are when it comes to controlling and preventing rotation so why don little bit in rotation it to do with a nab wheel just don bit at an angle here go a little bit at an angle there again jesse and i are doing the exercise here he learned some mistakes from what we already corrected here in the video but he opposed to me here where i little bit left a little bit right a little bit left every time i head off in one direction i rotational challenge for my core and that discussed so i start making these really huge turns which i see people do and actually shorten the exercise and make it a hell of a lot easier because their travel or the elongation of their core is much more short than it would be if they went out straight i straight and challenge yourself but make the turns pretty gradual a little bit left a little bit right you so there you have it guys five things that you want to make sure that you never do when you ab roll ass and even though i know you repetitions i promise you the ones you do are gonna be that much more effective and that the day and as i talk about all the time here guys it it and if we put the science back in strength everything we do will have much more of an impact when we do them so if you we put that all together you can find them over at athletnx.com in the meantime if you haven done so click subscribe and turn on notifications so you never miss a video when we do one and you can always let me know what you want me to cover i that for you in the days and weeks ahead that being said we why are you back here again how cool are those laser beams guys you are encouraging the hell out of him what are you look at what you creating here please no more laser beams what about in the outro i are you sure [Music] you	Success
Six Pack Abs Shortcuts! - \"13 Tips to 6 PACK ABS\"	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3tD9T4Pr5Q	ATHLEAN - X	it [Music] it [Music] Reese what aex.com here on a Friday the 13th I figured what better way could we sort of celebrate this whatever you want to call it day by then giving you what you want which is sixpack ABS and the best ways to get them 13 tips to sixpack ABS guys we gym we STS in the kitchen cuz it combination that gets them showing the most right first one I want to do is show you here up on a bar you know one of the quickest things you can do especially if you you have a shorter torso if you want to give the appearance of this six-pack a little bit more you got to train the obliques and the reason why is the fibers of the obliques actually run down at this angle what it give you actually a tapering effect leading into your abs and giving you a skinnier appearance of the waist in midsection how do we train them one of my favorites is just with a a a you know a leg raise but doing with a little bit of a Twist so as a this will be our regular lower ab leg raise what we going to do is we with a little twist you can see we get right in there on the obliques by doing so so remember don neglect the obliques rotate those lower body that lower body as you work you get the thing to show you get it to start tapering in all right guys up in the kitchen you know we know that down the gym is where you train your abs where you reveal them is up here in the kitchen with what you eat big tip for you is the nutrient Fusion I like to call and how we combine the foods that we eat the glycemic index is something that causes how quickly your blood sugar will rise after you eat a certain food if you spike it too quickly you descent more likely to store body fat so what we want to do is we want to control that and keep it stable the way to do it start with nutrient Fusion combine on your plate at all times protein carbohydrates both lean a starchy carbohydrate and a fibrous carbohydrate and put it all together and that you got the result here chicken some uh fibrous carbohydrates here through your your edamam your starchy carbohydrates here with like a um either couscous or or or quinoa and then your sweet potatoes so remember guys at all times never in isolation try to combine your proteins fous carbohydrates starty carbohydrates and um you know get them all in one plate at one time the xfactor meal plans handles all that for you progression is key when you your ab workouts you want to make sure that you say lower ab movements now we know it all one muscle but there are fibers that you can influence more or less depending upon whether you towards the top or top down so always if you can start with your lower ab work because you got half your body here that you to require more strength than it is if you off the ground doing some sort of upper AB or top down movement so it just makes sense as you strength like we did the last time do your lower ab movements they they more weight more legs more mass to get the work to be done so keep that stuff first you abs a lot quicker all right so you want to turn up the heat and get that sixpack shown a little bit quicker then you should literally turn up the heat when it comes to the foods that you eat there they common you have red crushed red pepper cayenne pepper you could even go for some readymade sauces that already have these ingredients in there the bottom line is that we have cap sain which is a ingredient key ingredient in here that going to increase the thermic effect of that food what I mean by that is the food is going to actually require more calories being burned to process it because of just that one ingredient so use these things guys as you will don ruin your food by putting so much of it on there but you effect if you put it on there I happen to like spicy food if you do here another reason to take advantage of it as you guys know it crunches as a matter of fact if you want to train like an athlete and look like an athlete you got to do more than crunches you got to add a lot of rotation to your ab work you can do in affle X you never isolate it to just rotation laying down or rotation standing up you got to have rotation doing both so you got to get those exercises in there where you standing up you got to get those exercises in there where you back with rotation of your legs lying down reason being is you the ABS from two different angles if you body you you upper body you Bottom the ABS work from the top to the bottom the bottom to the top if you want them to look the best guys like we do with athenex you got to train them in both ways okay back again in the kitchen another ingredient I think that to help you to get to that six-pack a little quicker just by having a little bit more of this is cinnamon now of course you guys you cinnamon on cupcakes and think it going to work its magic but what cinnamon does is it helps your body to metabolize sugars more effectively and more efficiently so if you take you think about sugars are different forms of carbohydrates you put it on your oatmeal um it actually increase the absorption of that become more effective lower that glycemic index that we talked about again before so don cinnamon again you can put in a lot of different things you can even put it in just uh something that you drank too uh Lattes or whatever but make sure you get your daily dose of uh of cinnamon and boost your your ability to get that six-pack show on quicker guys when it comes to getting six-pack abs you know everyone wants to know what are the best tips what can I do what exercises should I do uh what should I use should I use an ab roller um you know should I do how many sets of it how many reps should I do but one of the most overlooked training variables guys and I tell you right now don the time the rest time between your sets so remember it doesn you wrong rest time you the results that you have to you got to keep those rest times minimal you got to keep them in a very specific amount we talk all about it in athl X it the key elements of the program and the success of why it best ADW workouts out there in addition to everything else get those rest times nailed down guys you know first and foremost then start addressing the exercises then start addressing the reps and sets and everything else all right everybody knows how important water is but if you want to actually keep your metabolism running you have to drink water throughout the day we know that every cell on the body requires water to operate at its highest level so my tip is not just drink water we know you should do that my tip is the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning should be to have a glass of water I don literally jug it down you get about 10 oz 12 O if you can try to drink two glasses it time the most likely time that you going to be able to do that because you haven 8 to 10 hours so your tolerance to be able to drink that much will be at its highest in the morning and your body need for it will also be at its highest back in the gym no doubt guys the plank exercise is one of the best exercises you can do for your abs to get them popping and showing that said there right place to do a plank and everything else is wrong so I want to show that to you real quick when you you can either be too high or too low if I get down on my plank here and I get my butt up in the air this is what I would say is too high and what you you lot of the work because you much pushing yourself up and you really focusing on the whole key of this exercise should be right here in your abs and the on the opposite end of the spectrum you could get a sag in your low back and what you you letting them relax if I were to Crunch on the back on my back you would see how would crunch this way well here I actually just letting it all go and letting it you know letting it relax so not not only you not Contracting your abs here but you your low back in a bad position so the sweet spot for me is to actually go through those two extremes feel what it it because you won pressure at all you know in your abs at all and then go right in between so the sweet spot for you is going to be somewhat different for each person but it area pretty much straight ahead so if you planks make sure you the right spot if you want those right results okay the next big tip here in the kitchen is one of my go-to sources for protein skin milk now I talking about milk because there difference as we know between whole milk and 1% 2% and even skin milk 1% okay 2% in whole milk stay away from cuz look if you times throughout the day with your breakfast either mixed in your oatmeal or just a glass of it yourself by itself with your protein shakes you at least you know 24 32 ounces of milk a day that you have the 5 grams of fat that are in the 2% milk and the eight or nine that are in whole milk as opposed to the none that are in skin milk so great source of protein on the go ready made ready for you just make sure you stick to lower fat variations of this and you good to go all right another poor important tip here is and I know it going to sound crazy and so simplified but if you you want to develop your abs you have to contract your abs and I can when they do a move they thinking in their head how do I get from point A to point B and most of the time they supposed to be doing the job so remember your body it knows how to do to get to that point but it may not be doing it the right way so quick demonstration if I have to get this band down to here okay to to work on you know just my ab exercise in my head here is some kind of a crunch I can get there I from my arm I a little my hip flexor to actually pull my body down I symmetrically that wrong if you want to get the ABS to do the work then you got to get the ABS to do the work you take it here you crunch through the ABS and come down okay here crunch through the ABS and come down I could demonstrate here on a hanging leg raise again hip flexor involvement is going to be a key mistake you to be lifting with your hip up right that would be the wrong move what we want to do is we want to take here and we want to contract the ABS first like that you see like a little pelvic roll and then up and down that little pelvic roll will tell you that you using your abs and down so remember guys if you want to work the ABS you want to get them to show you better use them when you do the exercise all right you want to get six-pack abs this is one of my biggest pet peeves anybody that tells you a calorie is a calorie is lying to you because your body digests and metabolizes things much differently depending upon the source of the calorie we food a little bit thermic effect meaning how many calories are used just to digest that food when you about pure sugars it you talking about proteins it 25% or so of that food goes towards just digesting it so let me show you a real quick example you go to starbcks you see the treats that they try to pass off as little you know uh snack bites or whatever these little size cupcakes here could go 120 150 calories a little uh you know lollipop here could go 60 calories these calories are not going to do the same thing for your body as would quality calories coming from let pear or a banana and on top of that not only are you going to be able to get more from it because there vitamins there more benefit from the food but you also going to be able to eat more of it the better quality of the calories the better the the more you body that food to build muscle it to metabolize it better you can eat more of it so double benefit there would you rather have two of these or one of these little cupcakes don answer is this but you see what I talking about all right guys so as you can see there here if you want to get six-pack abs if you want to get them as fast as possible you got to utilize strategies in the gym strategies up there in the kitchen to make sure that you are giving yourself the best chance to do it in do it right athletex has it all laid out for

6 ÂGut BustingÂ Ab Exercises (NO CRUNCHES!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkaRgiKXxB8	ATHLEAN - X	[Applause] that happy honey I was thirty minutes late even though the Swiss man is actually he was but they watches and Switzerland yeah so what we got today I suppose I look at me weird of course so I think the the the biggest misconception when it comes to core is I think people get bored of it cuz I think it much more than crunching we talk about all the different functions there physical therapist I stressing that your core needs to be stable and not just being able to produce movement so sure we know we can crunch that is one of the functions of the ABS but we also know that can generate rotation but more importantly can also prevent rotation you put your arms out in front right here and stay right where you are in order to do that you can already feel your core work yeah so it prevents that also to prevent extension so if we over our hand here right I could push you back this way what are you gonna do got the car that there it there no one in there so we want to make sure that we cover all those functions and we so okay throw a whole bunch of things at you today both the guys at C and C you know if you at least even feel things that you maybe never felt before which is probably the goal of this is to make you feel like you know what maybe I haven revisit core training especially athletically you require all these elements to be top level athlete okay this has to be long like you don to have like there really a 30-minute core workout now we might go through a bunch of different exercises to show you some of the capabilities in the course if people see some of the different things we could do but really when you put together a workout you about six exercises or so we really cover like the main areas the core we talk about working from the bottom up yeah you know lower abs mid range we kind of contracting both the bottom on the top there abs or upper abs but in terms of how you preferentially it then you can influence that because of the direction of pull what is actually moving is it the pelvis moving on the cloud or the shoulders moving down towards the pelvis so you want to break those up and you want to include rotation okay either a top-down or bottom-up rotation or someone who like obviously you know you have the athlean-x box here you know the access to it so someone has like someone who has like this so for people who were taking this very very hard when we together it so yeah I love that you opposed to going yeah yeah well I used to be two months we met me super I was a little bit of air coming in about your ass number I said that the most important thing is is basically curling your pelvis so Dan like this this curling of your pelvis posteriorly right anterior be where you your butt out as far as you can posterior be curling it up and under to really engage the lower abs you looking for posterior tilt that is the main thing I always use it show your ass like if someone front we should see your ass when you doing this okay up here and you should see it here so basically that say very little pelvic tilts anyway no pasilla we now you gotta get a little rotation because we know that you a little bit more a presentation you talking about right away so verify on that yeah don don yeah as well all right here we go right yeah and once you you don want to be able to stay nice and tall and then what you do is you do a great line so you the other and then step behind and then one foot behind the other and step over you here and the real challenge is the current actually when you pick up the flooding because it soon as I I got a lift to go in this direction I on foot and I direction so as I here so if you start to get wider now you less narrow and more likely to want to tell them now and you weight and we his bark is not going in that direction it yeah and we can actually apply Wow straight over the actually apply some of that force here that I force on the roof change a change yeah guys you camp here say super brave change Seamus great change shapes do a high rate change always rewrite now we also want to be explosive right so as a very capable being exposed to bear whatever create rotational explosion alright save some sports it to be rotate from before and then let it express the rim of your limbs so we do hear battles and we use our core to really initiate obviously people use battle ropes yes an upper body condition we or our Instagram video cool when you doing it you know I that oh what will you do is you come here and we positions alright the first thing is you so obviously guys see how they do it use the ball we our knees here in this position and at all meal and what you to create an arc because if you don have you just do this there much court work going on it becoming that time maybe a little bit more of a anti-rotation drill but we want to get it to be the rotation of we you here you want to get a higher arm down and then side right so again that sort of a rhythm right then the next position that going to stay there you start if you gonna do a set from the top from the tall milk position then we get down so we decreasing our support from underneath these were pretty good support now we here I got really used my core a little more to generate force and now this is more of a traditional Russian twist here but again I want big arc in here you step on that who friends like we right go on that tell me [Music] that for training and every kind of saying I say put the corner it really which can happen if you training you see like just in that transition you got to stabilize your body and control the momentum of the ropes here is you drop down to the left side right so this is getting harder and harder for you jump out okay the challenge is once you get out to here can you keep it there without letting us know so the further you go the harder yeah as opposed to a machine was rolled all right will be this pretty much - here talk about like you know athletes agility or the quickness right when they they tough especially working on right here when someone goes that cut like that and they cut back if their core is weak in their hole when they step like this and our whole body goes in that direction yeah now they momentum back over here so it quick they even even agility which is comes from maybe yeah [Laughter] [Music] do the front you never make a good Irish dancer here right and now this is a basic plank but what I want to do is I want to come out and reach out in front thanks I got that extra resistance here and of course the band is one side so I wants to pull me that way too but it oh so what is happening the plank you still a static play I staying quite the whole time but I actually distracting myself with a little bit is all pricing I mean you get maybe a little athletic turn on the shoulders will really make the main point here is to get this added resistance which makes you work you part of the plane if you a minute plank you do 30 seconds of punchouts on the right just slide your body over five seconds in we endurance here a little bit more challenging all right you sorry this wreck your head yeah give me no give me the complete wrong motivation [Applause] I don about me so may you Tony forget Mike Tyson punch-out big Tony good job thank you sweat from that workout man yeah I saw thank you thank you thank you [Music] you	Success
8 Pack vs 6 Pack Abs (THE HARD CORE TRUTH!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J9C7rO5aUI	ATHLEAN - X	what dcom so let abs versus eight pack abs somewhere along the way six-pack had became not good enough now we need eight and a lot of times people will say Jeff how do I get my eight pack and a lot of times those questions come from people that have a zero pack so I always find it interesting it one step at a time let your sixpack before we worry about eight pack and I not that all these packs are not even possible at all if all you is five sets of stuffing your mouth with a bunch of food because nutrition is and always will be the number one key for loow your body fat to reveal the ABS that you have to reveal the structure of your rectus abdominis and that brings us to the next part if your diet is in check then where are we going wrong why do we sometimes see six why do we sometimes see four why we sometimes see eight or even 10 we it it linear Alba in our ABS now I show you a couple pictures just to sort of underscore this point first of all look at this guy right here now what you see here is a thicker more blocky set of ABS okay not so flat they prominent they a low body fat level but you can see that these are really sticking out and prominent these likely come from the fact that this guy is probably doing some heavy weighted ab work because his muscles have hypertrophied but it also could come from the fact that the linear Alba is a little bit more tightly sutured to the uh the connective tissue below so that you get these deeper valleys in your abs okay let let another guy this guy right here you can see he has much wider valleys here between this the blocks of his abs okay his rectus is much more spread out again nothing that he did in his training caused these deeper valleys it the fact that he has a thicker linear albow than someone like me who has a thinner one that keeps them a littleit closer together so therefore his sit further apart next guy you can see this one here now you bit of uneven ABS again I think all these look good the fact of the matter is you got a six-pack I going to be impressing people who are looking for that by having any degree of ABS the fact is we have to make sure that you becoming obsessed with something that you which brings us to the eight pack abs with the eight pack all we do guys we look at the three different rows or or or of the general three rows we see of ABS we have our top two that sit underneath our chest right up at the top here it okay then we go down to the next row which would be our middle abs and then we go down to the last row here which is usually even with your belly button okay what what where the eight pack comes in is below that and some guys genetically have the ability to show two more ABS below why because that linear Alba is sutured tightly down there too yes it going to require low body fat level but it train your lower abs because when you get down here you have to make sure that again body fat levels are low but you training your abs W with lower ab movements now some of you might say but you can isolate one area of the ABS versus the other and you impossible to isolate one area of the ABS versus the other but we do know that scientifically we have different nerve inovations about three or four different nerve interations to our ABS that can preferentially incorporate different areas of the rectus abdominis a little bit more favorably by the direction of the movement if the movement is occurring from the top down if we doing top down movements like crunches or band crunches things like that we see even through EMG that we see an increased AC activity of the upper fibers of the rectus abdominus whereas if we hanging bar raises or reverse crunches we see preferentially an activation of the fibers in the lower area of the rectus abdominis so we know we can do that and also guys you know just empirically by doing your own ab workouts that doing ab hanging AB raises you feel much lower than you do up here in the upper area of your abs and vice versa when you do crunches you feel it much more in the upper area versus the lower area of the ABS so we know that it exists but if you don that genetic makeup of that linear ala crossing here below the navl underneath your belly button you get eight pack abs it doesn lean you are or how shredded you are you can have it so that being said what can you do get that diet in check here recap for you stop eating those bad things throughout the day get your diet in check do your ab work I recommend six to seven times a week yes I always think that doing your ab work as again as a as a postural muscle you should do your ab work regularly doesn could be 5 to 10 minutes that it needs to be but do your ab work regularly Target all the areas of your abs Target your obliques your obliques have an ability to frame the outside of your abs we talked about that before and give you a tapering effect train for top down movements train for rotational movements train for lower ab up movements we incorporate all these movements into our athex training system with over 115 different AB moves so obviously I place a high priority on it but the fact is train them and stop worrying about whether it I good especially if you can build some lean muscle to support it and look like an athlete around it then you your way to looking the way you want to look guys hopefully you found this video helpful in the meantime if you looking for a system to help you start getting the sixpack the eight pack whatever it is that you might have then head to aex.com right now and grab our athletex training system and in the meantime if you found this video helpful make sure you leave a a thumbs up below whatever else is that you want to see this is watch for Wednesdays once a week AB devoted videos you tell me what you want to see and I it all right guys I again soon	Success
13 Tips to Get 6 Pack Abs Fast!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92cjFZzTuVM	ATHLEAN - X	What but the number 13 is what I put together my best 13 tips, both nutrition\\xa0\\nand training to make sure that you complete\\xa0\\xa0 that journey to a six pack once and for all.\\xa0\\nWhich, by the way, starts in the bathroom. \\n\\xa0 So, the first thing on the list actually has\\xa0\\nto do with the first thing that you need to do\\xa0\\xa0 in the morning. And that is you need to reach\\xa0\\nfor this before you reach for this to jump in the\\xa0\\xa0 shower. And that is drink 16 to 20 ounces of water upon waking,\\xa0\\nI mean before you do anything else. You see,\\xa0\\xa0 it starts the habit early and you can continue\\xa0\\nthis, maybe you need one of those reminder water\\xa0\\xa0 bottles, but water is going to be essential\\xa0\\nbecause if we don training tip and even every other nutrition tip\\xa0\\nin this video is going to suffer if you don So now when it comes to the training side\\xa0\\nof getting six pack abs, the sequence of\\xa0\\xa0 the exercises you perform is actually more\\xa0\\nimportant than the exercises themselves. I\\xa0\\xa0 know that surprises you, but I want to show you\\xa0\\nhow to get this right every single time. All right\\xa0\\xa0 focus when you are the same exercises, but they I see the top and the bottom in that exercise. \\nI see the top moving but the legs staying still\\xa0\\xa0 here, and I see the legs moving and the top\\xa0\\nstaying still. Well, what is the right order?\\xa0\\xa0 This is not right. Because what we want to\\xa0\\ndo to get the most out of your ab workout is\\xa0\\xa0 go this way. You want the bottom-up movements\\xa0\\nwhere just the legs are moving to come first\\xa0\\xa0 and that moves because we have to lift the additional\\xa0\\nweight of our legs. These are always going to\\xa0\\xa0 be the most difficult exercises you do. \\nNext, we want to still focus on any exercise\\xa0\\xa0 that in this case from the obliques so you fatigued here. The last exercises that you put\\xa0\\ninto your workout are always going to be the\\xa0\\xa0 ones that just move the top, because no matter\\xa0\\nwhat state of fatigue you going to always perform these movements without\\xa0\\ncompromising the overall effect of the workout.\\n\\xa0 All right so now piggyback that on top of that\\xa0\\ndivision half for your workout, I got one here for\\xa0\\xa0 your plate too where we actually want to divide\\xa0\\nyour plate. Because if you do this nutrition\\xa0\\xa0 will become a lot more simple for you. If you\\xa0\\nvisualize looking down at your plate, think of\\xa0\\xa0 it as a clock. Right? And if we look down at the\\xa0\\nclock, all I want you do to is focus on two times,\\xa0\\xa0 9:00 and 9:20. Once you do that, the rest is easy\\xa0\\nbecause all you do is then portion out your plate\\xa0\\xa0 with different components or macronutrients. \\nIn the largest portion here, that with your fibrous carbohydrates, right? You things that crunch. I have a whole list of them\\xa0\\nfor you on our website, I description below. Second you then fill up that\\xa0\\nportion of the plate, the second largest portion,\\xa0\\xa0 with protein. And again, it doesn a meat eater, your proteins go here in this\\xa0\\nproportion. And then you fill up the rest of\\xa0\\xa0 your plate with your starchy carbohydrates,\\xa0\\nand notice I I think they do get the smallest portion because we tend to\\xa0\\novereat those if we And then over the top of it all is our incidental\\xa0\\nfat. Not piling it on, but more so cooking with\\xa0\\xa0 it. The fact is guys, when you divide your\\xa0\\nplate like this nutrition becomes a lot easier,\\xa0\\xa0 counting calories is not something that you\\xa0\\nhave to do and at the end of the day when\\xa0\\xa0 we get our nutrition in check the six pack\\xa0\\nabs are a hell of a lot easier to see. \\n\\xa0 So, counting calories isn reps is one of the worst ways you can go about\\xa0\\nyour ab workouts. You see what you need to do is\\xa0\\xa0 you need to stop counting reps and instead make\\xa0\\nthem count. And that means trading in quantity\\xa0\\xa0 for quality. See, if your ab workouts\\xa0\\nlook like this, I can guarantee you not getting the most out of them. \\nSpeeding through repetitions just to\\xa0\\xa0 reach a certain number is not going to get you the\\xa0\\nresults you want. Instead, they should look more\\xa0\\xa0 like this. And I know it looks slow and I know it\\xa0\\nlooks deliberate, but really what you is a quality contraction. So, instead of counting\\xa0\\nreps, if you count the contractions you be on the right path. And again, it doesn good repetitions here, what looks like it Now let to some of your lower ab exercises. And see if you\\xa0\\nwant to get more quality, then you on doing things like this, and that is what are\\xa0\\nyou actually trying to move? If you want to get\\xa0\\xa0 the most out of your lower ab movements,\\xa0\\nit Is the pelvis moving through space? If\\xa0\\nit spine and you The second thing is, is there something we can do\\xa0\\nto recruit lower abdominal muscle fibers better?\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, we can do it by contracting your adductors.\\xa0\\nIf your ab movements allow it you would actually\\xa0\\xa0 squeeze your knees together or cross your feet\\xa0\\nover like this and then perform your ab movement.\\xa0\\xa0 The additional stability that comes from the\\xa0\\nadductors on to the pelvis gives you more leverage\\xa0\\xa0 to let those fibers do a better job of pulling.\\xa0\\nYou it a try and I promise that quality of every\\xa0\\nrepetition is going to go through the roof.  \\n\\xa0 Just like those bottom-up movements, we\\xa0\\nactually have an opportunity to do two things\\xa0\\xa0 to dramatically reduce the quality of all of\\xa0\\nour tap down movements. The first one is, again,\\xa0\\xa0 the thing that life, we is driving those lower ab movements, shoulder\\xa0\\nblades getting off the ground will drive proper\\xa0\\xa0 top-down movements. And there of every repetition and I call it the folding\\xa0\\nribcage. You see if I were to draw an imaginary\\xa0\\xa0 line right here under my ribcage and then just\\xa0\\nfocus on just trying to fold my body in half upon\\xa0\\xa0 that line you will feel a much better contraction\\xa0\\non every single one of your top-down movements. No\\xa0\\xa0 matter what crunch variation you will increase dramatically in the long run. \\nSo, one of the techniques I like to tell people\\xa0\\xa0 when it comes to creating an overall benefit\\xa0\\nin terms of fat loss, is to seek out the\\xa0\\xa0 opportunities where you can sort of just sneak in\\xa0\\nthe things that have a marginal impact their own,\\xa0\\xa0 but together can actually make a difference. And\\xa0\\nthat use every single day, and that Pepper Flakes which I put on my dinner at night\\xa0\\nwhich I shared in my full Day of Eating video. \\n\\xa0 And I also shared Cinnamon, how I like to use\\xa0\\na large amount of it every single morning in\\xa0\\xa0 my oatmeal. Whether it be through increased\\xa0\\ninsulin sensitivity, decreasing your appetite\\xa0\\xa0 or just by increasing your metabolism each of\\xa0\\nthese act in their own way, but the big thing\\xa0\\xa0 is they The next step is actually something I shared in a\\xa0\\nrecent video of mine because it I have adopted into my own nutrition plan in just\\xa0\\nthe last year, and that is the addition of Ginger\\xa0\\xa0 every single day. You see Ginger has the ability\\xa0\\nto help our fat loss efforts by decreasing our\\xa0\\xa0 insulin sensitivity. It also has an effect on our\\xa0\\ntraining because it decreases muscle soreness. So,\\xa0\\xa0 if you to get much out of the next one, then this is\\xa0\\nwhere this can have an impact in both ways. \\n\\xa0 All I do is just simply reach for a pinch of\\xa0\\npickled ginger just like this every single\\xa0\\xa0 morning. It add up when we to seeing those six pack abs ultimately.\\nSo, the kitchen isn the little things matter. Jesse\\xa0\\nactually tells me that they matter\\xa0\\xa0 in the bedroom too. Wait, what? \\nWell, that Of course. So, when we Because on every repetition of every exercise you\\xa0\\ndo, you should be breathing. But are you doing it\\xa0\\xa0 right? Well, here but you don exhale with the pushing of the stomach. \\nYou actually want to do the direct opposite,\\xa0\\xa0 blow air while pulling your stomach down. And we\\xa0\\ncall this cinching. You want to cinch your stomach\\xa0\\xa0 down to activate the Transverse Abdominis. And\\xa0\\nwithout this activation, yes you might wind up\\xa0\\xa0 with a six pack, but it everywhere, right Jesse?\\nYeah, something like that. \\n\\xa0 So, if you and frozen yogurt every single night. Okay, maybe\\xa0\\nnot exactly whipped cream and frozen yogurt. Guys,\\xa0\\xa0 the point is, this is something that I actually do\\xa0\\nand I shared that again in my Day of Eating video,\\xa0\\xa0 because I need something to\\xa0\\nmake the process enjoyable.\\xa0\\xa0 But if you hate the process, then you Ultimately, if getting six pack is torture,\\xa0\\nyou Now, am I saying having a hot fudge sundae with\\xa0\\nDouble Stuf Oreos on top? No, I something a little more responsible, a healthier\\xa0\\noption that still satisfies that cheat seeking\\xa0\\xa0 impulse you have that Speaking of sanity, one of the fastest ways to\\xa0\\nbecome frustrated is to actually have a set of six\\xa0\\xa0 pack abs but actually not like the way they look\\xa0\\nbecause something missing, most often it Serratus and the Obliques. Because much like a\\xa0\\ngood picture, the frame is going to focus your eye\\xa0\\xa0 on the masterpiece that you created. If you don So, while there this one is particular gets it done in one move\\xa0\\nand it is simple is to twist as you come up and press\\xa0\\ndown through your hands, getting that protraction\\xa0\\xa0 for the Serratus and getting the twisting for the\\xa0\\nObliques. Regardless of what exercises you choose,\\xa0\\xa0 remember the framing is as important as the\\xa0\\npicture itself. And now that you know it,\\xa0\\xa0 remember not to forget it. \\nSo, if the Serratus and the\\xa0\\xa0 Obliques can taper your eyes and make\\xa0\\nthem focus more towards the midline,\\xa0\\xa0 a pyramid will tend to focus your eyes up towards\\xa0\\nthe top. But if you up towards the top of this pyramid, then that your six pack. Because cardio is not the basis in\\xa0\\nthe foundation of getting six pack abs and neither\\xa0\\xa0 is ab training. And a lot of people think that\\xa0\\nthat is the foundation. But we know, that as we covered here already in this video, nutrition has\\xa0\\nto be the foundation of everything you do. \\n\\xa0 If this isn what you do up here in terms of working out,\\xa0\\nit wrong down here in the nutrition. \\nHey Jeff, you got any snacks for me?\\n\\xa0 Uh, I Grapes?\\nDude, even more sugar. \\n\\xa0 You want a carrot?\\nAh, figures. Might as\\xa0\\xa0 well be a candy cane. You got any jerky\\xa0\\nfor me or something, I mean come on. \\n\\xa0 Jerky. Fucking jerky you. \\nAnd finally, though extremely important, extreme\\xa0\\xa0 nutrition tactics are not necessary and never will\\xa0\\nbe when it comes to getting abs. Avoiding apples,\\xa0\\xa0 grapes and carrots because you think that is sort of like the same mentality of thinking\\xa0\\nthat throwing a deck chair off of the Titanic\\xa0\\xa0 was going to save it from sinking. \\nIt not necessarily ready to come face-to-face with\\xa0\\nor change, that often times are really standing\\xa0\\xa0 in the way and those extreme tactics are never\\xa0\\nnecessary, it ourselves. But now we have an actual list here\\xa0\\nwhere we can start to adopt even a few of these\\xa0\\xa0 to set us on the right path to getting\\xa0\\nthose six pack abs once and for all.\\n\\xa0 So, if these 13 tips have you excited to start\\xa0\\nyour journey to six pack abs, but you for more, I Or, my complete Day of Eating video that I\\xa0\\nreferenced a few times in this video that\\xa0\\xa0 you daily meal plans included with all of\\xa0\\nour workouts, you can find them over\\xa0\\xa0 at Athleanx.com.

5 ÂOld SchoolÂ Ab Exercises You Should STILL Be Doing!!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_30Y7HLJc	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com today we back in time old school back in time like like this old school back in time to help you to develop your abs because there were things that these guys were doing back in the day that you should still be doing today as a matter of fact if you on your ab training I actually followed this exact thing the universal bodybuilding magazine and I did the ab exercises there and a lot of them still make the cut today so I them down for you one by one and show you exactly think I should help with this what are you doing what is what are you talking about I see come on man it was Jesse on both all of you Eugene the third what is this the mustache oh I think the mustache looks fantastic for my style oh my god you know you did you have any try to do its 20/20 I think that Jesse fellow had one and if I recall 20/20 is 365 days so he more days to do that would you mind if I did my video please I these exercises sure I over at the first exercise for you there guys like it or not you asked for it he number one alright first exercise up is think dragon thrust I like this exercise as a stability exercise and it plank for a good reason so if we come up here hands behind your head anchor yourself somewhere Bartholomew good okay so so you put the legs and you start them into the chest and you shoot them up or out so this is going to be easier for someone that you be able to get them and shoot them out at that angle there but what here you need to be able to lift through the glutes to stabilize here so as this is up you need to drive up with the glutes in the opposite direction that what makes this exercise difficult but it makes it much more valuable than say the plank which actually has the glutes a bit on rest so you want to make sure that when you do this exercise again start off at the top if you need this and then slowly lower yourself down here so you get the east-central work on the abs or if you you come up you shoot about that angle there lower lower lower lower lower and you hold it there you lower yourself down long like that without overextending barth all of you oh that was very tough next up we the abscissa exercise number two the abscissa and you your arms down you know do this in due time I will the abscissa and to get in position to do this exercise you have to have your arms behind your body on the bench is that my cue that okay back like that you recline your body down right into that position there your legs are straight down towards the floor and you time here good definitive squeeze and down other side good definitive squeeze and down you can continue to alternate this back and forth the the beauty about this exercise that is number one it doesn place the same strain on the lumbar spine that maybe some of the laying down exercises do that require your legs to be straight because when you get down to the end if you hold it you might go into a little bit of extension keep doing the exercise the last thing that you know here that we see here is a benefit is that in those exercises when you do lift your legs up towards the sky when you get to the very top you actually lose a lot of the resistance on the ABS in the very top position in this exercise you don at its highest range here you actually got peak tension or almost peak tension on the lower abs here making it a great exercise choice the next exercise here is you might be surprised to see the Jessie Bartholomew could I talk to her please sure this is the seated broomstick twist you seen this way back in the day there big change that I want you to make if you about simply twisting as fast as you can like that okay enough it this way you which this should be targeting your obliques the way to do this is to position yourself on the edge of a bench here and then get into posterior tilt and do something that I don often to do and that is to round out the thoracic spine to create a little bit of kyphosis because when we do when we get in that position here we gonna limit the amount of rotation we get with the rotation we will get will come from the thoracic spine as opposed to trying to force rotation as a lumbar spine especially for high repetitions or for long periods of time so if we get in this position we recline just a little bit he tilted here that look straight up and then in here now you into the obliques in almost drive your elbow from this side to this thigh and then from that elbow down to this thigh so tie the side we climb back a little bit more round out there you go you might have thought you could get I don know two minutes worth of twisting the other way you might only get 10 to 15 twists total do it this way so the key here is though you were doing it right and you the process try it this way and I promise you going to see more from it next exercise is going to be the single sided dumbbell carry exercise number four I mentioned the single sided dumbbell carry one of the hardest things you can do for your core to challenge it is to simply pick up a dumbbell but just one because if you pick up - you gonna balance yourself up I just noticed Jesse we got better adductor flexibility I wouldn definitely Bartholomew so we pick up one dumbbell and all you have to do is walk around with it watch what happens when you do this is a pretty heavy dumbbell Bartholomew will pick it up in one arm and we see right off the bat that in order to stabilize and keep these shoulders level that this side here has to contract as if he allowed this thing to take over his whole body would drop in this direction of the weight instead he here really learn how to stabilize and strengthen and then we add some dynamic movement to it by simply having him walk this way where you going so you want to walk around and do carries I heard that dumbbell drop as long as you possibly can without actually just allowing the dumbbell to drop keep those shoulders level maintain a stable pelvis maintain stable shoulder positioning and walk as far and as long as you can and last but not least right here the captain that does not mean remedial or at a lower level it means you can focus more on the ABS and they knew this and they did a lot of their work here on this device this is why because instead of having to focus on holding on to the handles of a bar and do hanging leg raises that we any exercises you see Bartholomew doing here you can focus on the ABS because all the support was being born here through the forearms and we can do things like this oblique twist we can do things like this the bicycle raises we could do things like a simple knee raise here or a straight leg raise if you higher level the fact is you be able to get more quality repetitions out here because of this device taking the demands off of your grip as the weak link and putting it all right here where it you have it guys there are five moves that maybe you forgot about a long time ago but I won to start incorporating them again and the good news is not only we see good results from doing those but we also all don oh would you rather see this classic at [Music] Jesse Jesse yeah can you go work on your intro please yeah dude house we use the moustache anyway classic exercises guys make sure you put in the use it as a matter of fact I appreciate the classics I actually appreciate the new way we should train ABS how we can improve ab training there that the ABS are responsible for a lot of times controlling movement and not even allowing it in the first place and we need to train all of those I actually have developed them in a complete ab training system that athlean-x and

6 Pack Diet Plan Disaster (CALORIE CUTTING!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUt8ckGybWE	ATHLEAN - X	what today I Smartboard to discuss a dumb mistake that a lot of people make when it comes to dieting for a six-pack you see if you rely on calorie restriction as your main and and pretty much sole method of getting to a lower body fat level you going to run to a brick wall a lot harder and faster than the one behind me here to create a body fat loss we have to create a caloric deficit we about that a lot of times before there a a thermodynamic law that states that we need to do that that doesn calorie restriction because the biggest mistake people make let arbitrarily we calorie daily maintenance level that what yours is and you want to create a 500 calorie deficit because you know you need to do that in order to lose some weight lose body fat a lot of people will do this completely through a five 00 calorie restriction on what they eat and that it people will will find that they results doing this but then all of a sudden they hit that wall and they stop seeing results and it predictable because as you think about the calories that you also restricting from your muscles and your muscles are going to be your best friends your metabolically most active tissue to allow you to guess what raise this set point from not 2,000 but maybe 3,000 in a day because if you have the metabolically active tissue like muscle why the hell won not so smart to stick and allow you to burn more calories throughout the day just because of the muscle you have to maintain you a lot more dietary flexibility in the long term and that is how you get this thing done 365 days a year like I preach so you don you want to do is if you maybe what you do and a lot of people may not like to hear this but they restrict their calories by a little bit take the obvious thing out of your diet you is this probably not what you in a day but again arbitrary numbers but take something obvious out of your diet that you know you probably shouldn have and then that then go burn 400 extra calories to get yourself down here that is going to create a much more effective plan because you calories to the muscle that you trying to build maybe you working out and if you that can talk about in a different video you better be working out at the same time because otherwise you skinny fat you you like getting abs but having no muscle it a bowl there you want to have a much more effective plan unfortunately for some but maybe uplifting for others you to get your ass into the gym you going to have to work out and start burning some calories our burst training workouts that we have plenty of here at athle X are geared to do exactly that help you to burn a lot of calories quickly so you don day to burn 400 calories you going for a slow jog here through the park if matter of fact if you one of our videos here actually did a 10-minute workout I here where we did nothing but burpees 10 different variations of burpees in 10 minutes you expenditure of energy feels like if you that you got to stop looking at severely a strictly dietary restriction of calories to get down to this number you don fact try to see if you can do it as little as possible that way so that what you calories to allow you to support the muscle growth that to ultimately raise this number and make your nutrition plan a hell of a lot easier to follow guys if you for a way to have your ass kicked I more than happy to do it for you you can head to athlet next right now get one of our training systems I coach you through every single workout and I provide you with a diet plan that will allow you to make nutrition much more simple than it is and allow you to actually stick to a plan 365 days a year that is what I try to preach here at this channel year in and year out and that is what I everybody that watches us it that hard it little bit of dedication and effort here and then I you to do all the rest from there all right so see me over at athletes.com in the meantime let me know how you felt about this video leave your comment com and thumbs up and I will be back here again in just a couple days with more stuff for you see you	Success

The FORGOTTEN Core Muscles Workout - Serratus Shredders!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URhP3tUogDw	ATHLEAN - X	shredded seratus no guys not a breakfast cereal but mandatory if you want a shredded core and today I show you exactly how to do [Music] it what the seratus interior that talking about today for some of you you might not even know what that is okay I can guarantee you it is a muscle and is actually one of the core muses Muses of our core and I think right off the bat we have to clarify what that really means cuz I think most of the time when we hear the word core yes it word but what it should mean to us is much more than just the ABS the core should be looked at as every muscle that really Falls between your shoulders and your hips and more so those muscles that have attachments to either one of those places because the core is actually going to be controlled and all the Motions of the core are going to be controlled through the muscles that are situated in between those two points so when we talk about the seratus that the muscle that falls right in here you can see it right here on my rib cage actually attaches to the upper ribs here and it goes underneath my lat underneath my shoulder blade and actually attaches back on the medial side inside of my shoulder blade right up near my spine the job of the serratus it depends on what your function is it called the puncher muscle because it going to protract the scapula okay meaning move it forward and around and away from my back directly opposite of what the round boys would do now there is some time when they actually work in conert together but for the most part when we developing it it protraction so when we look at it it actually can form a bit of a visual you know framing of the ABS with the oblique so it comes down and in and it to frame out everything through here so when we talk and even the under under the chest when we talk about the importance of this muscle we have to understand that there are going to be aesthetic reasons why you want to develop it and there athletic reasons why you want to develop it so what I want to do today is show you three different ways and we can cover the gamut so regardless of what your focus is because I know guys on athl X are using it for both Aesthetics and Athletics so why don first one of the simplest ways that you can actually do this while you and it variation we include this in the FNX program we have a regular pushup position which is here and straight up okay down and up to activate the seratus though is really simple we just add one additional component to it and we call it the push-up plus so we come to the top and at the top we then reach further we ground basically taking our shoulder blad which are right about here stable and then rotating them even more around the front protracting them so here down push down push down push okay pushup plus again every push working more into that seratus in here to again give you that visual effect next a direct uh one that we can use to now tie in seratus with the abdominals together remember guys athl X is not about isolation exercises it about trying to work muscles together that prefer to work together that the guys that follow the program get the fast results because they muscles the way that they want so when we do this we focus away from chest and triceps into the seratus and now more into our I don specifically into our seratus so what we do is get into a position here okay we know that that engages the ABS and we actually allow ourselves to collapse right cuz the round boys are going to kind of pull together squeeze together get our shoulder blades pinched and then come up and out okay I my elbows here to get this kind of action okay get that going on the protraction of the shoulder blades so into our plank let it collapse up and throw through push through down and push through down and push through I can really feel I than before because I have a lot more body weight being managed here through my forearms than I did with the help of my hands and my shoulders so it of a body weight more intense exercise than it was before finally Athletics I mentioned it before as the punching muscle so what we do is we get our band that we can set up over here and we think like a boxer boxers will punch and rotate again you punch straight to here you want to punch through okay through it that extra pushes rotation that get the seratus here now you can keep the exercise right and tight which is going to work the core you rotation remember if you standing rotary ab work in your current workout guys you major function of the ABS okay so we know that this is necessary but now I showing you a way that you can tie in the serratus at the same time by reaching around okay you can do it more dynamically here reach around here and reach so you full all the way around really reaching out in front of me all right so again I know there are in it for the Aesthetics for the looks we know summer you want the core because you you want to go out to the beach and be able to show it off perfectly fine guys I can tell you even the elite pro athletes that I work with guys are guys they still want to look good I understand that but it when you so with a purpose and become athletic at the same point and much more functional and that really is what athletex is all about whether it Athletics you guys are all building for the same purpose and that tomorrow than you are today it to get there if you haven as I said summer is right around the corner there to start aing X because we can incorporate exercises like these and get results Faster by working muscles together you can start seeing results in time for the warm weather so that you looking good by then as again you can go grab the program right now over at aex.com in the meantime I here in 7 Days make sure you leave a comment or a thumbs up below if you find

Home Obliques Exercise (INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pddWTcUo5aI	ATHLEAN - X	What athleenex.com. So today I show you a great home oblique exercise. Now a lot of oblique exercises are in fact capable of being done at home, but a lot of them because they involve rotation will be done hanging on a bar. And I know that a lot of people sometimes don bar. Maybe you an option that you could do just on a floor with nothing else. This is what you yourself into a side plank. Okay. And it got my hand here just in a fist like this on the ground. I bit. Okay. Right to here. I get up into a side plank. And then I take my hand that my head. I and try to get my elbow here to meet my fist. Now, I That any type of rotation for my torso. So, what I want to do is keep it up here. I I make contact here. Now, what you should see is that the external obliques on this side will be activated because they rotate my trunk to the right, then the external obliques on the left will be activated. If I rotate my trunk to the left, then the external obliques on the right will be activated. So, what we do is we here activation on the left hand side. a little bit of eccentric too because we don that we collapse down to the ground. The next thing we do is after we touch down here, we come back to the top and then we get a lift here up at the top. Now the lift is going to activate both the internal and external obliques on the right side to cause a lateral trunk flexion. Okay? When they work together on one side, they way. Are they the best at doing that? No. We got muscles in our back, the quadratus that are much better at doing that job. But we can get that little activation there. Again, further work our pillar strength on the side here and come down. So, two parts down, touch external on the left, up, lift, external, internal on the right. So guys, incorporate this move, especially if you looking for ways to really kind of fill in the gaps when it comes to your ab training because your obliques will do a great job of tapering in and giving you that visual appearance of having a more tapered waistline, better looking abs as they frame them out on the left and right.

V-Cut Ab Exercises (BETTER IN 3 SECONDS!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK3x0n1Ww3o	ATHLEAN - X	what x.com so who knew that the key to your strength in your lower abs was actually going to come from your legs your abductors the muscles that run up the inside of your thighs you see you have to understand the anatomy of the pelvis in order to be able to appreciate that but it doesn your don you today you out of your lower ab exercises because you have to understand that with the adductors running up your thighs okay running right up here in your groin they attach to your pelvis from below and when they tensed and contracted they provide tension from down below now the muscles in your abs are going to come down the opposite direction they going to come from here or here and run in they from the top down now we talked about before that whole phrase about not being able to shoot a cannon from a canoe or at least not being able to do it accurately because you don stable base to be able to operate or gener at force from if I take this band right here and this were to be my abductors from down below and this is going to be my abs pulling from up top if my abs were pulling and I didn a lot of force generation from down below because my adductors were either weak or in the case I you here not contracted or activated then I can kind of pull this hand around like a dog on a leash because this isn really able to provide any kind of counter Force to what I from up top so everything moving but because of that the Gage can never really contract or do all that much to generate Peak Force because they an opposite force to be able to allow that so now if we take this and I stretch this all the way out down here because now the adductors are strong and or activated now when I grab on here and I got to pull in the opposite direction I got a lot of force in this band this is going to kind of simulate the amount of strength that you can generate the amount of the strength of contraction that you can generate now from your abs think about what that will do to your lower ab exercises to making them much more effective so how can we do that it used this fat grip here for a lot of things other than as a fat grip and I going to use it again you can use a baseball you could use a tennis ball anything that you could put between your knees do your lower ab exercises while squeezing this between your knees what happens is you start to get the abductors to fire up now that they pulling and and working from down below the strength of contraction your ability to become more efficient with your lower contractions better so think about it here I again a lot of us will do this exercise and allow our legs to just drift apart not stay together but what I just told you will allow you to have a better exercise if you do it so now squeezing this performers many leg raises as you can you can do this right now you can actually stand up cross your legs over each other and squeeze your thighs together as hard as you can and then contract your abs and you stronger contraction I could take this down to the floor though too doesn have to be hanging from a bar any movement where we towards the top so with a reverse leg raise or reverse curl again put something between your legs and then squeeze it and then bring it back up to the top you contraction as I said better results over the long run when you start to apply this little technique to all your lower rra exercises so I hope you guys found this helpful remember we got to put the science back in strength when we need to because it doesn things nerdy it actually makes things more effective and that all about if you complete training program that will get you into the best shape of your life by putting the science back in strength don all through I just have to do what I do and let it all work for you all right you can find that over at athletes.com in the meantime if you found this video helpful make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below and I my best to continue to bring you guys what it is that you want to see here on this channel each and every time all right I	Success

Get ÂSix Pack AbsÂ in 22 Days! (2023 AB WORKOUT)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Bx0Qz1Xro	ATHLEAN - X	What especially if you a zero to the end of 22. But don actually a follow up to one of our most successful\\xa0\\nad videos of all time. And it extinction style ab training, which is something\\xa0\\neveryone can do. Literally everyone at any level\\xa0\\xa0 can follow, I low levels of body fat in order to be able to see\\xa0\\nabs, 5% is not a necessity. As a matter of fact,\\xa0\\xa0 I but a good set of abs. And with the plan based\\xa0\\naround the consistency of doing it every day for\\xa0\\xa0 22 days, it helps in another very important way.\\xa0\\nIt helps to start to get that nutrition on track\\xa0\\xa0 because that get ourselves to care enough about nutrition\\xa0\\nto support the levels of body fat that we going to need to see six pack abs. \\nBut when we can do anything for 22 days,\\xa0\\xa0 we start to bring in habits or at least routines.\\xa0\\nIn the case of getting on the floor and doing a\\xa0\\xa0 small little ab routine, you ll actually will\\xa0\\nfind that you putting in your mouth. You those lower body fat levels will actually let you\\xa0\\nstart to see the results of your hard work. \\n\\xa0 So how is this extinction ab style training work?\\xa0\\nLet me start by showing you here with the first\\xa0\\xa0 exercise. This is called a Lower Ab Spike. Your\\xa0\\njob is to perform ten repetitions. Everybody and\\xa0\\xa0 even at the beginner can you do as many as you can, and you move on to\\xa0\\nthe next exercise. If you can do all ten because\\xa0\\xa0 you you rest 10 seconds. However, many times it takes\\xa0\\nyou before you can the exercise becomes what we call extinct, and you\\xa0\\nmove on to the next exercise in the workout. \\n\\xa0 One thing I want you to make sure you do on the\\xa0\\nAb Spike is just try to hold that top position\\xa0\\xa0 for even a second or two, that hold it for just that brief second, a little\\xa0\\nbit more time on retention for the abs. The\\xa0\\xa0 more advanced you brief ten second rest in between and maybe even\\xa0\\nthe beginners will work their way up to where\\xa0\\xa0 they can perform additional sets of this. \\nThe second exercise here is when we call the\\xa0\\xa0 Seated Knee Tuck Drag. And we because we want to tie in the lower abs with the\\xa0\\nobliques. And all I want you to do is sit and\\xa0\\xa0 bring the knees in, drag them across the body,\\xa0\\nand then shoot your legs out. When the legs are\\xa0\\xa0 extended there, you can see that obliques. You get to pull them back in, drag them\\xa0\\nacross and shoot them out to the other side. \\n\\xa0 This exercise is actually done for time and\\xa0\\nthe same thing applies. There requirement for this exercise. So, if you can. You work your way up close to 45 seconds,\\xa0\\nif you can the way to 45 seconds, you rest 10 seconds and you\\xa0\\ngo right back into the exercise again. Now, this\\xa0\\xa0 is going to be one of the tumblers here, because\\xa0\\nwe know that even if you not going to be cranking out four or five sets of\\xa0\\nthese. The great thing about Extinction Style Ab\\xa0\\xa0 training is that it will limit the number of reps\\xa0\\nyou can do, but at the same time it do it at a level that called a Power Up, it s a mid-range ab exercise.\\xa0\\nAnd what we do here is we and the bottom-up meeting in the middle. And\\xa0\\nthis is an explosive exercise. I want you to\\xa0\\xa0 bring yourself up and reach up, but not just\\xa0\\nup and forward, but almost up and backwards,\\xa0\\xa0 up over your head. Because the additional weight\\xa0\\nof your arms here is going to actually provide an\\xa0\\xa0 additional challenge. The more straight\\xa0\\nand behind your head, your arms can be,\\xa0\\xa0 the more weight you have to carry in that position\\xa0\\nand the more difficult the exercise becomes. \\n\\xa0 Ideally, everyone and a little bit back. But again, the number of\\xa0\\nrounds you can perform is going to be determined\\xa0\\xa0 by your ability level. So, ten repetitions,\\xa0\\nif you can get all ten rest, those 10 seconds,\\xa0\\xa0 get right back into it, do another ten. If you can\\xa0\\nget all ten again, rest those 10 seconds and keep\\xa0\\xa0 going until you can Seated High Twist, and this is a good oblique\\xa0\\nexercise. And again, I want you to stay really\\xa0\\xa0 up tall with your posture here, don keep the elbows pointed out to the sides, hands\\xa0\\nback behind the head, but not clasping on your\\xa0\\xa0 neck and just simply twist from side to side.\\xa0\\nBring your leg up just a little bit, not really\\xa0\\xa0 driving your knee up, just giving your elbow a\\xa0\\ntouch point. So, as I twist towards the right,\\xa0\\xa0 I want to be able to touch my right knee to\\xa0\\nthat left elbow. This is another one of those\\xa0\\xa0 timed exercises, 45 seconds. How many rounds can\\xa0\\nyou do is dependent upon your ability level. \\n\\xa0 Next, we looking seven, but you drive your knee towards the opposite elbow,\\xa0\\ndrag it across your body to the other elbow.\\xa0\\xa0 Bring it back to the original elbow, then\\xa0\\nget that tuck that lift of the pelvis to\\xa0\\xa0 really engage the lower abs and then bring the\\xa0\\nknee back down and your foot back down to the\\xa0\\xa0 starting position. And then you bring the other\\xa0\\nleg up and you do it in the opposite way.  \\n\\xa0 Again, one way it to be a regular looking seven that the idea here\\xa0\\nis that seven is going to be your lucky number,\\xa0\\xa0 sort of, on this exercise. You want to do five\\xa0\\nof them to each side for a total of 10 that is\\xa0\\xa0 going to make up one round. The number of rounds\\xa0\\nyou do as always, is determined by when you hit\\xa0\\xa0 that extinction number. And again, at this\\xa0\\npoint in the workout, there fatigue that The last one here is something called a Sunrise\\xa0\\nSit-Up. And I always say these top-down movements\\xa0\\xa0 for last. Why? Because our abs are stronger moving\\xa0\\nfrom the top down than they are from the bottom\\xa0\\xa0 up because we don start with one arm out to the side and the other\\xa0\\narm folded across our shoulder and we to basically sit up and reach out towards the\\xa0\\ncenter a little bit explosively at the top. Allow\\xa0\\xa0 ourselves to fold in the opposite direction,\\xa0\\nopposite arm reached out straight, the other\\xa0\\xa0 arm folded across our upper chest. Come back up,\\xa0\\nreach out in front and come back. We creating this big arching motion, this sunrise\\xa0\\nmotion, and we for a time, 45 seconds. Again, you have thought because these top-down exercises\\xa0\\nare less challenging, but appropriately so\\xa0\\xa0 because you can do in literally just this much amount of\\xa0\\nfloor. It the consistency matters. You have to do this every\\xa0\\nsingle day for 22 days. Because, again, that will\\xa0\\xa0 establish a bit of a routine change for you. And\\xa0\\nas routines change, things start to happen. \\n\\xa0 When I was a kid, I ate nothing but sweets and bad\\xa0\\nfoods. But what happened? When I started to work\\xa0\\xa0 out, I knew that I wasn I eat completely different. If you guys year-round, you can find it in my Day of\\xa0\\nEating video. If you like this video, make sure\\xa0\\xa0 you leave your comments thumbs up. Let me know how\\xa0\\nyou do. I been asking for it. Also, if you haven you never miss a video when we put one\\xa0\\nout. All right, guys. See you soon.	Success
Smart Snacks for Six Pack Abs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXikF5wPjbA	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] hey guys Jeff cavaliere back here from athleanx.com with the next installment in our series on nutrition our snacks and again my counter is filled up with a lot of food to kind of reinforce to you that you are not limited in the amount of choices that you have for snacks I think we ideas that we have for snacks and what really qualifies as a healthy snack so today I want to show you about five or six that you can easily take with you I know a lot of guys are busy a lot of you are on the run I want to give you some options that you can have that you can take with you be portable and make sure you get your snacks in here here guys if you from breakfast to lunch you looking at around 6 hours that 6- hour time period is way too long if you trying to build muscle if you want to build muscle you need to constantly feed your body every 2 and 1 half to three hours to make sure that your muscles that are trying to recover from let say yesterday constant flow of nutrients ready to be delivered to them to help the repair to help the recover to help them get bigger so you need to eat every 2 and 1/2 to 3 hours the nice side effect of that is also going to boost your metabolism and make you start to burn fat so starting off on this end here you can never go wrong with a peanut butter sandwich you want peanut butter and jelly that kind of bread this is this is Weight Watchers bread you don need to have Weight Watchers but it low calorie bread it slice some of the ones out there actually have like 160 to 180 calories on each slice you know some of the Seven Grain multi-grain breads just be careful with the breads that you select but a good whole wheat bread something I would say probably less than 80 calories per slice would be great for you put on your peanut butter if you want cut it into Force this way here you can grab them just in quarters you can grab them a half at a time very portable they going to go bad throughout the day so that you can also if you want go with these single serving you know cans of tuna again they got a pop top on the top very easy for you to you know to to uh you know to bring with you to the office good source of Omega-3s uh again very easy some cheese wedges you know these little Laughing Cow they make the cheese wedge good source of protein uh individually wrapped so they very portable they bad you can take them with you throughout the day here looking at some uh hardboiled eggs for some protein you have your yogurt you can you can mix those with just a handful of almonds you know something to give a little bit more healthy fats um what you could do if you want to is create your own and these are all included in the in the meal plans is create your own uh sort of Trail Mix bag take your almonds a handful again we don plans guys I don little robots that are taking out your measuring cups and because that not going to work it might work for you for a couple days but you get tired of having to do that and you important thing about the athlean xma plans is that you actually stick with these things from start to finish cuz you time you finished with the program when you when you pair it up hand in hand with the training so handful of nuts even if you want a handful of these semi chocolate right low low sugar in here they not like regular chocolate mix them up handful together with the nuts uh bring out some of your favorite cereal now I know last last time a couple guys said they couldn cereal over you overseas a low sugar cereal guys something like Cheerios something like crispix something like you know that it low sugar we Lucky Charms so mix it all together it a good way to put a little plastic bag you have some trail mix that you can bring with you as well one of my favorites are the bars protein bars just because for me they portable I know I protein in them the calories sometimes fall between that 250 to 300 calorie range which is a perfect goal for you for your snacks and uh again they to me they taste they taste pretty good so I recommend in the program uh that you know most mostly the prograde line of of uh supplements and EAS they both high quality very reputable companies you and you going to delve into the unsafe things okay or some of the glorified candy bars that are out there so lastly one thing I like to do also another tip that I tell guys you in the program prograde you know workout is one of the things I recommend again very highly um uh high quality highly purified real stuff uh you can count on the quality in this and actually helping you to build muscle you take your scoop of this powder this comes in powder form take it out put in your shaker bottle in the morning okay just leave it in the bottom there when you it you pour in your bottle of water and then you shake it up and you have your drink and somewhat fresh it hasn sitting in there all day all right so you can actually you know maintain the freshness of this just by changing the way that you mix you know you mix it up and add your ingredients that said finally water water is key okay guys you got to make sure that you drink water with every single meal of the day the athl X meal plans the xfactor meal plans revolve around the fact that you going to have water every single day with every meal cuz you got to shoot for that you know 80 to 100 oz level so in order to do that take your water take a bottle of water with you each day if you have a problem getting the water down I know some guys said they can water and they can crystalite crystalite is amazing you know there comes in God knows how many flavors you know you that you like pour a packet into your water mix it up and it make sure you get as much as you need during the day guys all this stuff again these are just about five or six of the meal options I wanted to give you but there within our meal plans just for snacks just for

start okay it pops up a workout as you can see six minutes is the total workout time here and this is what I got on the on the agenda basically all I do bring it next to me I set it down I start it we queuing that comes with it it follows guys my six-pack sequencing that I talk about as well the importance of working lower to bottom of rotation to mid-range to top down that whole sequencing is all

3 Exercise Core Killer - No Crunch Core Workout	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sq2l7Oz_0DA	ATHLEAN - X	AB strength or AB stability are you training them differently and should you be I today [Music] what athleanx.com you know we this week a little bit backwards to last week when I did that super plank and more so that progression of the planks you know how do we move from a very basic easier version of the plank to a more progressive and difficult version now one of the questions that came in a lot last week was is that an ab strength exercise it like to think there different main focuses of your of your abs there strength now is a plank an example of out of stability yes is an example of AB strength not really I know a lot of guys who train the hell out of their abs with planks that can test and succeed really well when they train their abs and test their abs and that enough of it so what difference well to me it ability to overcome inertia all right think about it in terms of benchpress if I can come down here I have a stop dead stop position and overcome a certain amount of strength here like it paused or frozen rep right from here and I can push up to 25 out of a pause that don you basically have to like I said overcome that inertia and overcome gravity to do that well if I took a bicep curl and I held it right here that necessarily a good test of my strength my strength would be what could I do to get it outside or overcome that inertia without having to lean back so much but this I could probably hold for a long time this I could probably hold for a long time that how my strength is here for my chin-ups so for abs your planks are more of that they that mid-range position before failing not like this so a leg curl long leg raise is going to test your strength a lot more because I have to overcome again from my legs hanging down here get them up and pass the the low sticking point which is way too right at the bottom and then overcome gravity all the way up to the top so the ability to come up and overcome that and then control it on the way down and up and overcome that this is a lot more of an AB strength exercise then say the plank so now my whole thing is do we want to always this worth the strength do we want to work our stability I don athlean-x we always combine the two because one feeds off of the other strength feeds off of stability the state with more stable you are the more you can push off of a stable base even when you more strength you have the better your stability is going to be so they kind of get feed in and feed off of each other you don vexer sizes you should be doing in every single thing you do so again an athlean-x I don bent over row there tweaks that we give you to make sure that you through your core at all times and every single exercise and also the strength so now let me show you one last thing sort of a bonus time here let to get back into the planks again let say you don plank that we did last week so let me give you another variation take a piece of tubing wrap it around something stable come out here walk it out okay just to the outside of your legs now I already have some resistance in here now we can do plank walks out here walk it out against that resistance it already difficult okay walk it back slump okay walk you out all the way up go ten out and ten back next one and from here okay out punch out punch obviously we three point stance here once I get this arm off the ground only three points of contact I have for those two feet my core and then this arm on the ground the right arm okay out and out work those lastly take them out here t spins get it out open it up to the top don and down punch it out open it come back down out open it come back down run through that little three exercise circuit I feel like I strength a lot I can plate it it was more stability pair them up together you and stability guys if you haven already head to athleanx.com don what you already joined the rest of team athlean but now summer we all want to look good yes it not summer in all parts of the world but it is getting warmer look good this summer guys me proud of the effort that you put in the hard work doing stuff like that for a reason now here other thing we about some new stuff right we to try something new this week I want to see what your top comment is whatever the top comment is I will answer it next week now think about this I know that sometimes the top come has to be a little like I said it strange use it or lose you guys make it good they I stupid blog it is stupid answering was a good one I promise I answer it should be a little bit of fun what the top comment going to be voted up all week and I promise the beginning of next week I will answer that as well as give you another great video guys we you back here in 7 days get those thumbs up whatever you want to ask me [Music]	Success
Do This BEFORE Every Ab Workout (GET BETTER ABS!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HKMTQgLC9k	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com today I want to show you one thing to do before every one of your ab workouts especially if you somebody that has a hard time either a feeling your abs work when you are doing your ab exercises or B you tend to feel it more on your low back and that because you hip flexors to do your exercises and that now we can do that with reciprocal inhibition now this little fancy word is just something that really means if we can activate or contract a muscle that acts on the opposite side of a joint then the one that we don then we can reciprocally inhibit it or at least turn it down a little bit so that the other muscles can do the job and that your hip flexors are initiating too much of the movement when you crunch or do any other ab exercises we is try to get them out of the equation so the ABS can do more of the work and the hamstrings are able to do that because of their function as hip extenders okay what we can do though is also rely on the glutes too because we know that they can also extend the hip so what you do is you take this foam roller and you put it back here behind your ankles and up against your butt and you squeeze your glutes together and your hamstrings at the same time everything should be kind of being squeezed up and under and when we do that now the hip flexors have to sort of shut down a little bit and when we have that done now when we initiate a NAV contraction it ABS instead of the hip flexors over dominating so you want to do a levitation crunch you squeeze here okay keep that in place and we just lift the shoulders up off of the ground just like that and immediately you should feel a much stronger contraction here in your abs because they work harder okay we do 10 reps of that then we come across our body same thing squeeze come up and twist just a little bit up and twist a little bit here you go five on each direction so now you up to 20 reps and then finally we do some kind of a bottom-up movement here so we squeeze with the foam roller back and then we initiate the lift just like that again with the hamstrings actively engaged here and the glutes squeezing from underneath the hip flexors can these lower ab movements as they tend to and this is where a lot of the low back pain comes from so we go ten reps here so now when it carries over to the full ab workout the one thing I want you to realize is anytime you lower ab movement where the bottom comes up here then what you want to do is make sure that the hip flexors are not doing that work and you can do that by actually limiting the range of motion a lot of times what people will do is they think that going all the way down is a great idea because you weight of the legs increasing the moment arm making the exercise more difficult but what that you move your hip flexors to get back up to the point where your pelvis moves right I have to go all hip flexor here to be able to get to the point where my pelvis can then lift and go through the movement what I down that low right go down so that the pelvis and legs move together all the time when it gets down to the point where the pelvis no longer moves then you with that rep can go back up again here so I pelvis is stable and the legs are moving on it that would be hip flexor but if I can get the pelvis and the legs to move together then I you likely now because you hip flexors to sort of blood out and get out of the equation I you a bonus here too what thing you should do after every ab workout you really need to stretch them guys people don nearly enough there are muscles they need to be stretched again if this is going to be a static stretch you do it when you preferably I like to do this at night but certainly not before we do our training but a nice ab stretch is just literally keeping the lower pelvis into contact with the ground and then just coming up for a stretch and hang it out here like that so there you go guys one thing to do to start getting those ABS to feel a more on every ab workout you do by activating them more properly in getting those muscles that we don to be contributing out of it if you looking for a program puts the science back in strength not just on our training but in everything we do head to athleanx.com right now and get our athlean-x training program in the meantime if you found this video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know we want me to cover here in a future video and I best to do that for you in the days and weeks ahead alright guys see you soon	Success
Six Pack Workout | Obliques (26 REPS ONLY!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEBiX0yrcT0	ATHLEAN - X	what today I you should ever train your abs if you want to get results as a matter of fact we little bit put the science back in strength and oh yes we the markers this is four markers today guys you know what they say about guys with four markers so uh anyway so what we on the muscles here to show you what I talking about when you look at the ABS there of muscles that come into play we call this area the abdominal region obviously but there into play first and foremost you have your six-pack muscles which are the rectus abdominis that run this way okay so the direction of the fibers will tell you the contraction pattern of that muscle it likes to contract down up and down okay but that those aren have in our core we then have our external obliques that you can see right here the external obliques are coming in in this Direction so you can see by the orientation of those muscles that they like to rotate and create this sort of oblique Direction movement that they internal obliques they the opposite direction I of my colors here they go up this way so you can see they actually form like a cross-hatch pattern with the external obliques so now we know that they can come down that way so there you go now you got your final color here which is your transverse abdominis that runs like a weight belt straight across this way okay so it actually its function here is to cinch down the waist and and provide stability from within but it part of the overall abdominal area so if you only have two choices the first thing is you pick individual exercises that take your entire core through all those motions you got to have rotation you got to have top- down rotation right from here down you got to have bottom up rotation so this stays fixed and this rotates on the bottom you got to have the ability to do this traditional forward up and down crunching you have to have the ability to stop rotation right we want to be able to provide that stability using the transverse abdominus in preventing rotation and controlling rotation so you got all these things that you can do and I that down for you and all of our athenex training systems I give you are six-pack promise that actually breaks down all these exercises and and we group them into small workouts that allow you to hit all these these movements in one little AB training workout six seven minutes but you could also do what I have here and that is if you time I it you can do because it incorporate all these various motions at one time it come here to a hanging bar and what you doing straight up knee raises okay you of the knee raise which means you going to try to spell out every letter and you can see that right here as I start moving my legs around I kinds of rotation and stabilization I don Direction because I got to get back in the other direction we have that anti-rotation everything is being addressed at one time so what I want you to do is see if you can get up on the bar and then complete an entire alphabet so I go knee raise up and here and then across that and here then I go c big loop that way to the left D big loop back the other way e one of my favorite here then lower just a little bit and here lower just a little bit in here then come back up for an F right and then back up for G don forget the little tail right there H come halfway over back up and down you can see that you hit your entire core with all these sort of unpredictable movement patterns and that want guys I try to tell you all the time you can either train long or you can train hard but you can get a good ab workout in here it really difficult to make it through the entire alphabet and if you enough to do that there stopping you from trying to do it again if you that as I said includes all of our AB training and puts the science back in AB training along the way then head to aex.com and get our athex training system in the meantime if you like this one if you your comments and thumbs up below how far in the alphabet did you get before you had to cave in all right I back here again in just a couple days with another video I soon	Success

8 Worst Ab Exercises Ever (STOP DOING THESE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvKfxoAwiGw	ATHLEAN - X	There What AB exercises ever, as in I don I instead. But because we Oh, I got to do the dumb stuff again?\\nOf course. And you haven on either what I This is Daisy, my new Labrador retriever puppy.\\xa0\\nAnd guess what? Even she knows these AB exercises\\xa0\\xa0 suck. That being said, I want to make sure you\\xa0\\ndon so let popular ab exercises out there that I plank. And my reasoning is just that it than one minute, then you need to move on to\\xa0\\nsomething a lot more challenging because there no benefit to be had here, because it is too easy.\\xa0\\nThere position to the next level where it is capable of\\xa0\\nactually doing something beneficial for you. \\n\\xa0 Try an RKC Plank for example. What you do here is\\xa0\\nyou involve more muscles in the plant to make it\\xa0\\xa0 more difficult and rewarding. You initiate with\\xa0\\nthe glute and quad co-contraction tightening\\xa0\\xa0 your legs as hard as you possibly can, making the\\xa0\\ncore become engaged to a level you before. And to increase the difficulty even more,\\xa0\\nyou keep those elbows out of your body to increase\\xa0\\xa0 the impact it has on your core. But you want to\\xa0\\ngo even further than that and you want to involve\\xa0\\xa0 some weights, you Plank Row by placing just one arm on the bench\\xa0\\nand the other one in the air with a dumbbell,\\xa0\\xa0 you you losing the stability that I which takes this to another dimension.\\xa0\\nIn other words, not just challenging you\\xa0\\xa0 into anti-extension, but your ability to\\xa0\\ncontrol and prevent rotation. Remember,\\xa0\\xa0 guys, it it Nothing says I then this exercise number two, and it if you these either with two dumbbells at one time, in\\xa0\\nwhich they turn themselves into a human seesaw\\xa0\\xa0 or they actually happen. Because my problem here\\xa0\\nis you body doesn Your lumbar spine is not meant or designed to\\xa0\\ndo this, especially when you combine it with\\xa0\\xa0 the fact that you The fact is there a simple Side Plank Lift. You can see that when I\\xa0\\nlift myself up the side that I is the underside, the bottom side there that And when I lower myself back down,\\xa0\\nwhat does it look like I If you turn your head sideways, it actually\\xa0\\nlooks like a side bend right down on the ground.\\xa0\\xa0 But because we was originally intended. The fact is, guys, it you emotion into something that a fight with CrossFit, but they exercise. And they managed to take one of the best\\xa0\\nmachines in the gym, the Glute Ham Raise and make,\\xa0\\xa0 one of the worst AB exercise you can ever do the\\xa0\\nGHD sit up. Now, if you look at this exercise\\xa0\\xa0 here, guys, you can see right off the bat this\\xa0\\nis a one-way trip to the chiropractor. Your back\\xa0\\xa0 is not going to like you if you do this exercise.\\xa0\\nYou were never intended to do this hyperextension,\\xa0\\xa0 especially against the full weight of gravity,\\xa0\\nbecause this is a very heavily weighted exercise,\\xa0\\xa0 half of your body weight being lifted\\xa0\\nup on every single repetition. \\n\\xa0 And again, depending upon the pivot\\xa0\\npoint and where you place yourself\\xa0\\xa0 on this, because a lot of people don you get a real shearing force placed on your\\xa0\\nlumbar spine, it So how could you achieve the same degree of\\xa0\\nanti-extension challenge without having to\\xa0\\xa0 do this? Well, you can just stay on the floor\\xa0\\nand get the same benefit. And we have a simple\\xa0\\xa0 Roll-Up. And even if you have no weight in your\\xa0\\nhand at all by extending your arms up overhead,\\xa0\\xa0 you you on the way down. You And if you have the ability to you add a dumbbell\\xa0\\nto the exercise to add additional weight. Again,\\xa0\\xa0 we can start to mimic some of that challenge of\\xa0\\nthe weight of your upper torso of the GHD set\\xa0\\xa0 up by doing it with a dumbbell in our hands\\xa0\\non the Roll-Up. And if you have even greater\\xa0\\xa0 desire to increase the challenge, hold that\\xa0\\ndumbbell on one side, which is now going to not\\xa0\\xa0 only challenge the anti-extension strength, but\\xa0\\nalso the anti-rotational strength that you need\\xa0\\xa0 to develop as well. Any of these exercises are\\xa0\\ngoing to be way better than this one right here\\xa0\\xa0 and get back to using this for what it was meant\\xa0\\nfor in the first place, a Glute Ham Raise.  \\n\\xa0 Now exercise number four may come as a surprise\\xa0\\nto a lot of people that watch my channel,\\xa0\\xa0 but this one right here. Straight Leg Raises. Now\\xa0\\nlook, I have a lot of variations of exercises that\\xa0\\xa0 utilize Straight Leg Raising because it gives me\\xa0\\nthe opportunity to weight the exercise, the weight\\xa0\\xa0 of your legs is a good overload. That being said,\\xa0\\nif you can then any variation of a leg race is\\xa0\\ngoing to become problematic for you\\xa0\\xa0 because of what it does to your low back. You\\xa0\\nsee, lifting strictly with your hip flexors\\xa0\\xa0 and not being able to control the descent of\\xa0\\nthe legs back down to the ground because you\\xa0\\xa0 don as those hip flexors yank on your lower vertebrae\\xa0\\nevery time you lower them down to the ground. \\n\\xa0 If you have to use your hands to get yourself up\\xa0\\nthere, you should be doing this exercise in the\\xa0\\xa0 first place because you don into the ground, use them instead to check\\xa0\\nto make sure you Place them to the side of you, right alongside\\xa0\\nyour lower back, and try to drag them inward,\\xa0\\xa0 not pushing down. Because if at any point in\\xa0\\ntime I arch my back and my hands are able to\\xa0\\xa0 actually move inward and slide towards each\\xa0\\nother, that I know that I disengage the abs\\xa0\\xa0 and I a leg raise as long as you have the strength to do\\xa0\\nit and if you don Which brings us to exercise\\xa0\\nnumber five, and that is the--\\n\\xa0 May I interrupt this video with a public\\xa0\\nservice announcement from Daisy. \\n\\xa0 For crying out loud guys, if you to add some weight, please do me a favor and look\\xa0\\nto somewhere other than your pet for resistance.\\xa0\\xa0 And before you even say it, the pandemic and\\xa0\\nlimited access to gym equipment are no excuse for\\xa0\\xa0 using man the views are too good not to, let me ask you why\\xa0\\nI always reach for the little puppy or kitten when\\xa0\\xa0 you can create a real challenge and overload, but\\xa0\\nreaching for the big dog once in a while. Or would\\xa0\\xa0 that actually screw things up by feeling like too\\xa0\\nmuch of a workout. That a favor and stick with what you should be using in\\xa0\\nthe first place, weights and let your pet admire\\xa0\\xa0 your six pack obsession from the sidelines.\\nSo, exercise number six is the first of two that\\xa0\\xa0 are actually on the list for the same reason. And\\xa0\\nthat is it it which makes it a really bad exercise. This is\\xa0\\ncalled the Russian Twist. Well, actually, this\\xa0\\xa0 is it called the Russian Twist, because there your hands back and forth across your body,\\xa0\\nwhile it may give you the illusion that you doing something, is actually not doing anything.\\xa0\\nInstead, what you want to do is turn that Russian\\xa0\\xa0 Tap into a Russian Twist by actually twisting. \\nSo, the best way to do this is to focus on moving\\xa0\\xa0 the ball and your shoulders at the same time. If\\xa0\\nthe ball goes to the right, the shoulders will,\\xa0\\xa0 too. If the ball goes to the left, the shoulders\\xa0\\nwill too. Then and only then will you actually\\xa0\\xa0 be getting the benefits of a Russian Twist.\\xa0\\nAnd then and only then are you going to turn\\xa0\\xa0 this exercise that Which brings us to exercise number seven.\\xa0\\nIf the Russian Twist was the most commonly\\xa0\\xa0 performed exercise because of the lack of\\xa0\\nactually rotating, then this is the second\\xa0\\xa0 most commonly performed and this is the Bicycle\\xa0\\nCrunch. And again, it but it not really getting much benefit from the exercise.\\xa0\\nYou isometric hold with a bunch of elbow flips back\\xa0\\nand forth. We we So once again, what I do here is now I try\\xa0\\nto fix my elbows in place and not move them\\xa0\\xa0 across the midline anymore. The only way to get\\xa0\\nthem across my body is to actually rotate my\\xa0\\xa0 shoulders to do it. And if you lock your arms in\\xa0\\nplace and twist, guys, twist back and forth here,\\xa0\\xa0 you turn this from an isometric into an actual\\xa0\\nexercise that Which leads me to the last exercise, and\\xa0\\nthis is a big one, guys, because it any ab exercise that you do where you how you and instead make the reps count. When it comes\\xa0\\nto abs guys, that were to do, let I can guarantee you racking up a higher rep total, but I Instead, slow it down and get something out of it,\\xa0\\neven if it means doing 15 less repetitions. So,\\xa0\\xa0 in this example here, you would actually focus on\\xa0\\npulling the pelvis up and under. You want somebody\\xa0\\xa0 in front of you to be able to see your butt, not\\xa0\\njust the top of your kneecaps. But it doesn here because on the Ab Role Out we have the same\\xa0\\nproblem. This is another one of those exercises\\xa0\\xa0 that people will claim higher rep counts as some\\xa0\\nsort of an achievement, but they right. Instead of going back and forth into hip\\xa0\\nflexion, sitting back on your heels and shooting\\xa0\\xa0 your body out with every single repetition,\\xa0\\nyou want to focus this on the abs. So, go slow,\\xa0\\xa0 lock in your hips.

How NOT to Swing on Hanging Ab Exercises!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qPYYw3lPSA	ATHLEAN - X	what so today I simple way to make sure that when you doing either a hanging leg raise or a pull-up that you over this bar out of control a lot of people say that when I do my pull-ups I swing too much or when I leg raises I can swing too much it really simple to fix and we by fixing it over at the captain okay so you these if you you don show you over there is going to help but from a progression standpoint the captain with a couple opportunities to get this right and to learn and to build the strength first of all if I sit back into it okay and I rest my forearms down by placing my back into the back pad here I point of contact I have a lot of stability between my back and the pad so I can sit here stabilize really well and I can go and I can do my hanging knee raises say for my abs okay remember I always say you got to show your ass on these you got to make sure that you whoever is in front of you is seeing the bottom of your pelvis because you flexing and curling from the bottom up so I show that okay now you move away after you so now what we stability still I had some nice stability back here I don here but what could I do I could use my lower traps to depress my shoulder blades here and provide that stability okay now it you you what you do you get in here and you can point your toes just a little bit to engage your abs okay just a little bit in front of your body because if you go backwards it wants to promote swinging okay once you get in this position here you can do your leg raises again curl up and show curl up and show but at any point in time you should be able to stop and not be swinging okay now how do we transl transition this to the more difficult and more popular version which is hanging from a bar I you that right now okay so now back at the hanging bar again this is what we sort of building towards and again if it work on that progression there because you can still work on developing stabilization through your scapula to be ble to do this when you come over here but we have to reverse what we we still need stabilization because when I get up onto a bar What Here is my only points of contact now are my hands on the bar and my hands run through my arms which run through my shoulder blades if my shoulder blades are not controlled and allowed to move around my body in my rib cage I to have a lot less stability up here on the bar and I if I start to add momentum in it becomes a bigger problem okay and if I start doing leg raises it becomes even bigger problem because now I front to back momentum and we don that okay so now we need to be able to stabilize it fix two parts to it the first thing you want to do create stability from the bottom up we can do that by letting our legs come just a little bit in front of our body so once we hanging straight down just come up just like that a little bit in front of our body to create the contraction of the ABS here a little bit of stabilization okay the next thing now is the important part if you come around the back you can see that the shoulder blades are not really supported they just hanging here so what we want to do is once again engage those lower traps by depressing them just like that just a small little move pull them down keep your arms straight and do a scapular depression here okay so with the other that people think about though is they go really fast and they think that they they have it if I come up here and I do knee raises and I go really fast it looks like I same position here up and down with minimum swing and Swinging but all I done is take whatever momentum I was driving forward and back and I it up and down but I putting a lot of focus on the contraction of the ABS which means I not really doing that much much to improve what I the first place which is my core strength so don those two changes so here depression legs out in front here boom lock it in come up show your ass boom and down and down you can see I can kind of lock it in place here at the bottom of every rip and not be swinging all over the place so guys those little details matter and sometimes it that work so well and help you to do it once and for all I hope you guys are going to find that helpful and try it out I promise you it matter what part of the progression you start at in the meantime if you looking for a program that cares about the details they all matter head to aex.com take our two minutes to use our program selector by clicking on the link below this video it will help you to find the program that to whatever your goals are at the moment in the meantime if you found this video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know what you want me to cover in a future video and I best to do that for you in the days and weeks ahead all right guys I soon	Success

Home Ab Workout (ONE DUMBBELL NEEDED!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oKWugCTFMY	ATHLEAN - X	what sorry we missed washboard Wednesday this week but we didn just missed the timing of it as you can see I our new program getting ready here to release it in the coming weeks and I wanted to make sure though that I didn miss entirely what you guys want and expect and that today I put one together for you using a single dumbbell that even working at at home you want something with a little bit of added resistance you don know buying and investing in all big machines to do this if you have one single dumbbell at home you be able to do all four of these exercises let me take you through each one one by one all right the first exercise up here is pretty easy it great way for us to get a little additional weight it weighted crunch but the way I hold the dumbbell and the way I perform the exercise is the key do what we call a levitation crunch you try to levitate and push your shoulders straight up into the ceiling push that dumbbell straight up into the ceiling you don start pushing the dumbbell forward because as you do all you making the exercise easier the weight of the dumbbell is actually creating forward momentum to get you up off the ground if you try to go straight up remember guys our physics you that dumbbell right up against gravity that and that productive for you the next exercise here we have is our leg raise starting from below but you positioning that I I establish is a a bit of a rotated position pre- rotated I have my dumbbell here to create a little bit of added resistance to pull me in the direction opposite that my legs want to take me this right away is going to increase the activation of our ABS because we know they control rotation and at the same time it involve our obliques so we opportunity as I press both the leg and the dumbbell up together to work both from the top down and the bottom up but include the all important rotation and obliques in the exercise okay next we can take this dumbbell and we can actually do one of my favorite exercises and that ab whe you see if you take the dumbbell and you position it like an AB wheel all that matters now is that you get your grip pressure and the way you hold the dumbbell correct and that allow us to do this great exercise so as you see me demonstrate here all I doing is really changing the pressure that I fingers and through my thumb as I roll out I want to take all four fingers off and literally push the dumbbell away from me with just my thumb that allows the dumbbell to spin inside my hand and not get slowed down or dragged down by friction but as I come back what I want to do is then grasp with the four fingers and then release my thumb from the back side so that now I actually roll the dumbbell back if you grip too hard in both directions you going to wind up not allowing the dumbbell to spin or it like it exercise properly you just want to get the feel of it practice a few times and you this great ab exercise without actually even needing an AB real and of course we can still take advantage of the Rolling situation here by turning our body around and now positioning the dumbbell under our feet so here I variation of it I look like a sprinter one leg back one leg up right we mimicking the athletic movement of a Sprint where we dumbbell we knee we opposite one now the great thing about this exercise is again it lower ab targeted movement because we working on bottom up and we can even get a little bit of bottom up stability because we have to balance the positioning of this dumbbell under my foot you might find that it rolls away from you again manage the pressure in your foot become a little bit more coordinated and athletic it benefit of the exercise but the bottom line is you abs the same way you did through the top down with the roll out now you can do it in a reverse roll out situation and still using just that single dumbbell so there you have it guys there is a workout that you can do at home with just a single dumbbell or if you want to do it in the gym by all means go for it it using a little bit of extra resistance and not needing a lot of equipment and guys this is what athletex is all about you can do all of your workouts whether you matter to me a matter of fact we have a program you need no equipment at all athlean zero range to hard programs that utilize a lot of equipment in the gym it how far you want to push yourself and we mentioned it before ultimate arms is on the way sooner than you think keep an eye on uh here our Channel and of course if you you stay tuned cuz we you very soon when that the meantime I for more videos let me know if you try this video let me know uh if you found it helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below and we again in just a few days for yet another new video	Success

The Ab Workout ÂMaster TipÂ (EVERY ABS EXERCISE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE5l8WnLXjM	ATHLEAN - X	what the master tip series continues this time the ABS there actually is a master tip that applies to every single ab exercise remember the master tip to qualify as such needs to apply to every ab exercise you do it needs to not require any extra equipment or experience in order in order to be able to pull it off it also needs to be able to be something that you can do immediately the next time you train your abs and finally the damn thing has to work I say that all the time this one does work I big problem is when it comes to AB training when we do a side crunch this is what it looks like now you tell me if you can see me what I I crunching now I with my neck here that you can worst things but that wouldn every exercise what I with and what we need to fix we have to stop isometrically Contracting the ABS or the obliques or whatever ex muscle group that we running through the reps with this isometric hold because what we here if you look closely is we getting one single isometric contraction here and then we see people do this all the time look at how much movement I have going on up here at the top but I eccentrically lengthening or even concentrically shortening this muscle at any point in time what would look better and what we need to start doing is allow owing the full cycle of contraction so if I come down I then I come up into a full contraction and then I let it go eccentrically lengthened and then I come up into a full contraction a lot of people that say that they don so much in their abs it it when you yourself into this very tiny range of motion and not ever eccentrically lengthening so from that elongated position you could actually shorten that cuz you longer position to then shorten from so it applies to a crunch on your back too we look like this when we do our crunches we go up and down like that and again forget about what you of course you don on your head here like that and and pulling on your neck but what we doing is we isometric contraction here and then we we this constant isometric and and try them you can feel what I you come down you want to let it go and then contract and let it go and contract okay I hyperextension here the floor is stopping me from that I about letting that contraction go so you can actually shorten and get a stronger contraction we on a bar this is where it time where up here people do a leg raise they get into this position here and then they just move their knees up and down off that one contraction of the ABS now you might be thinking to yourself but wait if we time isn development of a muscle group you wouldn symmetrically and then move the joints around it that would be the equivalent of taking your bicep here get it to this position and then move your arm up and down during a curl you AAL development of the biceps by doing this you the bicep by going going to Ecentric lengthening of the muscle and then shortening the muscle the same thing happens here we get up on the bar we shorten remember guys show your ass here you got to get your ass up but when you come down you let it lengthen inside the ABS okay shortening in here lengthening the ABS shortening lengthening the ABS okay it not just holding on for dear life with one isometric and moving your arm your legs up and down finally even if I did a bench exercise here like a seated knee tuck again you see this all the time guys are in here they come up and they press now I shorten range of motion because you could look like you have full range of motion here but if I isometrically holding remember we stronger isometrically than we are concentrically so we challenging the ABS as much as we can that want to get an Ecentric lengthening here of the ABS and then in eccentrically lengthen in lengthen in lengthen okay get all the way out and then come back in don contraction again the master tip is one that you can apply to every single exercise this can be done no matter whatever exercise you do other than let necessarily an isolated ab exercise anyway you need to have some movement in order to be able to have that done a plank is an isometric in and of itself so guys the master tip is designed to to help you to get more out of the exercises that you do we all do a lot of the same exercises but it them that determines what you get out of it if you program where we always care about not just the exercises that we programming for you but how you do them head to aex.com use the

The Secret to a ÂRippedÂ Core (NOT JUST DIET!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGlax3pCnL0	ATHLEAN - X	What athletex.com. So, today I want to show you a very overlooked but important combination of muscles. If you really want to get a ripped core, all I got to do is lift myself up and show my artwork, show my muscles drawn all over the place with my markers. Because what you really want to do if you want to get shredded or have that shredded appearance, I here and tell you first is make sure you get your nutrition and diet in check. Okay? You if you don when you do learn how to eat right and your body fat levels start getting lower. They don getting lower, and I a second. Then you make sure that you pay attention not just to your abs, but to your serratus and to your obliques. Now the obliques are the muscles that run down here and sort of tie into your rectus abdominis. The serratus interdigitate. It does this. It basically sort of intertwines with the attachments here of the obliques. I didn that great here, but the serratus are coming in this way into the attachments here of the obliques. You can see it a little better here on my undrawn side that we have the obliques that are going to come down here and tie into the abs. And then the serratus, they go in here. They actually wrap in around and underneath the scapula. Their function is to allow you to press out. They you really want to have the ability or or or even the the self-defense muscles because you want to have the ability to be able to push somebody away from you, keep them on arms length. The the muscles that are responsible for that are going to be the serratus. So even if you don getting a ripped core, you do want to have adequate strength. And if you not training them, you get them stronger. So, we know, we know we need to do that. Now, as far as being ripped goes, guys, we focus a lot here on the abs, but the shreds, the rips, all the lines, the more lines, the more shredded, the more ripped you look are going to come from here. And here part that I told you that reason for optimism if you at an extremely low body fat level yet. Where do we store fat as guys? Mostly down here. So, when we what we do is we the top down first. You might see your upper abs far uh uh sooner than you would see your lower abs. You might actually see some serratus development and maybe even some upper oblique development, letting you appear to have a more streamlined waist if you start training them. So, here I Now, you don if you don bench, but the physio ball here allows for a stronger core challenge. You put your hands on the side of the ball. You get yourself with your feet back into a plank position. Now here you now push your shoulders away. Try to get as far away from the ball as you can without bending the elbows. The key is to make sure that you keep your arms straight. Try to get further away from or as far away from the ball as you can. So now you remember I showed you in the beginning these muscles are interdigitated. They like to work together. Why? That they So, let add some rotation to make sure the external obliques are working, too. So, now I take my knee and I drive it across. Keeping my trunk, my upper body straight, I drive the knee across. We getting bottom up rotation. And we do the same thing on the other side. So, we can either alternate, we can work one side at a time, but the key is this. Don start retracting back. Again, if you want to keep the serrus engaged, you got to keep them out and away from your body while you do these side to side uh movements. All right, so hopefully you will gain two things from this video. Number one, and most importantly, appreciation for some of the muscles that you can We always focus on the chest, the biceps, the abs, but we don think serratus. We don think obliques. If you want to get a truly ripped core, I you on these smaller muscles because these smaller muscles again provide the lines to show a more ripped appearance. And secondly, as I said in the very, very beginning, I again nice up and close. You better make sure you make sure you muscles because a low body fat level is going to be necessary, as I said, to start seeing them all all the way down to your lower abs. I got a solution for you. If you want to start eating right, guys, I make it as simple as I possibly can. And our X-factor meal plan actually allows you to eat and it allows guys a lot of diversity in their meal and how they approach their meals. And that why I think it stick to and why we get the results we do. I include it in our Athletex training system. You can get that over at athletex.com. But in the meantime, start training these obliques. Get something going here. Get the serus and obliques to work together. Include this exercise into your ab workouts. And I promise you, you results. Even if you start off a little bit on the high end of the body fat, you should still at least start to see some development and changes up above. All right, guys. If you found this video helpful, make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below. In the meantime, I couple days with another new video. All right, I	Success
HOW TO GET SIX PACK ABS...By Just Moving Your Arms!! (Secret 6 Pack Abs Exercise)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkRFP-qpTI	ATHLEAN - X	who knew that you could get a set of six-pack abs without ever moving anything but your arms today I to show you an exercise that you can put into your ab Arsenal that you might never have thought of before what aex.com as I said in the intro who knew that you could work your abs by just moving your arms but the fact of the matter is if you want to get a complete sixpack if you want to develop your whole core you have to make sure that you in previous videos on just crunching or just planks because you large part of what the ABS do and that what this secret exercise really goes after and that is the control or prevention of rotation and the control or prevention of a lateral trunk lean so as I said this exercise I call it a secret one only because most guys aren doing it or any variation of it and it a perfect way to attack like I just said those two main functions of the ABS I going to break out the TRX as you guys have asked me to do for so long now to show you but as I past if you don mean that you can this cuz all you need is an $8 dog leash even if you don over the top of your pullup bar attach it to itself slide it up and then now you got a TRX strap buy two of these and you should be good to go I though with the TRX and basically what we have to do is get it onto a pull-up bar something sturdy and the difficulty of this exercise is going to be determined by how close my feet are to the Anchor Point and how long the length of the straps are you can play around with that you know as you see if you need to make this shorter just wrap it around your hand once or twice and then can change your foot placement but you also want to make sure that your feet are staggered okay wider Bas of support is going to make this a little bit easier as you get stronger you can pull your feet even closer together but the idea here is to keep your feet in line with each other staggered get yourself away again a certain distance from The Anchor Point my feet are sort of midway between the Anchor Point in the bands and then what I you know at this 75 degree angle or so off the ground Now where like I said at this point we be moving our arms so the arms stay out in front of you right here now what is this doing right here makes it harder to talk is number one but number two is just I have to really work hard and hold in here to control rotation because if I let go it wants to twist me that way right these bands want to twist me in that direction so basically I have to get out here and hold that now from here if I let the arms go up overhead right in here now I have to hold trunk lean CU I that way if I don it straight out overhead straight out so preventing lean preventing rotation forting lean forting rotation lean rotation so obviously you do this on both sides You right and left the concept here see if you can get through six or seven up and down again I call this secret only because most people aren guys on athl next understand these principles so if you haven foll the athex program guys I definitely invite you to come on board team athleen and start training like an athlete incorporate moves that challenge your abs in every single direction right we don just plane or just rotation we work in all three and elements of them at all times okay so single plane Movement we can throw it out if we combine movements together we start getting better and better results guys as I said if you have already pick up the athl next training program and uh let me know what you think about this exercise whether you try it with a TRX whether you try it with a dog leash or even if you try it with a cable machine CU it all works I the meantime have a great rest of your [Music] week	Success
Ab Workout that Burns Fat (YES ITÂS POSSIBLE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S4aLmSp3dg	ATHLEAN - X	what today we out there when it comes to burning fat when doing ab work now we know there no such thing as spot training you can spot reduce belly fat by doing ab exercises okay but what you can do is you can utilize your time a little bit more efficiently and you can make an ab workout a fat burning workout if you use the right exercises we do this all the time with athletex we combine conditioning with core training to make sure that you hit both needs but you get it done a lot faster so today I want to show you exactly how to do that that right now you and some socks that cement like I have behind me perfect if you have a hardwood floor even better but the idea is if you your ab workout into a fat burning workout it has to be long enough you can minutes that and it athletex when we really want to just focus on training our ABS but in this case we conditioning workout and of course using our ABS at the same time so how do we get an ab workout that we can do for 15 20 minutes well it get up here into a plank position all right and then we we climber now this is a little easier position here than down on your elbows so if you want to be down here on your forearms you but you mountain climber and you that for 30 seconds okay so you the ability of your feet to slide on the floor to make this a little bit easier you up obviously this over time is what going to cause the conditioning benefit now from here we come up onto our hands and we this a gymnast AB move we legs straight and slide our butt up in the air and then down up and down 5 6 7 8 9 10 then back down into your forearms and go now you have to rest at any point you can rest on your knees but in a plank position okay so get your arms down you can see the ABS are still working here down but instead you want to keep it going now from here once you hit your 30 again come up to your hands this time swing your knees in to the side and then swing your knees in to the side two two three three four four five five back down and drive them out this time bring them to the side this way which looks like this on the camera do them at an angle keep it going once you back to the top in and out three four five 6 7 8 9 10 back down other side so essentially all you is mountain climbers you you can see I mountain climbers you either straight forward or at an angle right or left you gymnast ABS pulling in straight legged to the center or the knee slide twist that way right and left five and five the idea is you can definitely turn an ab workout into a conditioning workout and still make it an ab workout if you know what you by- step not just this workout but how to do it throughout all of our workouts in the Athletics training system and we say we put the core at the core of everything we do this is no exception conditioning can also incorporate the core and it makes for much more efficient workouts that get your results faster because you don 30 minutes doing each objective all right if you found this helpful guys leave your comments and thumbs up below and in the meantime if you want a complete program the Athletics training program train like an athlete start utilizing your time more efficiently get better results in the process it available over at athlet next.com all right guys we soon see you	Success
The 5 Best ÂAbÂ Exercises (YOUÂRE NOT DOING!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSZaP9gXyPs	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com if you really want to get your abs to show outside of obviously have a good nutrition you need to do two things you need to first and foremost make sure that you train your abs frequently enough and secondly again make sure you train your abs through all their various functions now how do we do that well an athlean X we train like athletes and I said all the time if you want to really get your abs to pop you got to start putting your core at the core of everything that you do so I thought why don five subtle ways that you can actually put your core at the center of five exercises you never thought you could to give you another example of how we do it because if you frequently enough guys it can rely on only your ab training sessions you need to start putting your core central to what you do in the weight room even if it see here in just a moment so let me take you through each of the five exercises and show you the slight little tweak that take to make sure that your core is firing on all cylinders through each one of the exercises alright first up is a classic shoulder exercise the dumbbell side lateral raise now how can we make sure that our core is much more engaged when we perform the exercise without sacrificing what we do from the shoulder benefit side of it well we can narrow our basis support we could drop on the dumbbells you see because when we perform this exercise traditionally our feet are about shoulder width apart and both dumbbells are moving together but what you balanced situation and without sacrificing the gains we can make on our shoulders we can make some very simple tweaks and that is to again narrow that basis support put your feet either right side by side together or if you little bit more of a challenge put your feet in front of each other and what we call tandem stance right now by having that we balance challenge that our core is going to have to respond to in order to keep us upright and moving this dumbbell the proper way now it hard because your core can definitely handle this but it an impact on your core than you ever would have in that balanced situation when you drop one of the dumbbells now we in our likes to respond to that by holding us upright instead each so you get this contralateral action on your core to keep you facing straight ahead so just these two little tweaks without any sacrifice to what you your shoulder can actually help us to get much more benefit in our ABS the next exercise is one I alluded to and that is the dumbbell one-arm benchpress now how in the world could have benchpress actually work our core well it does when you do it one arm at a time here at an incline dumbbell bench setup I can really work my core on over time because I contralateral side again to maintain my stability on the bench you see as I lower one dumbbell down I go light here guys because as a matter of fact if you go light your core really won here it body stable and straight on that bench so that as I drop my right arm down it really working hard on my left side to make sure that I don really simply you not only your core but your chest as well because what happens is if you have a one-sided weakness an asymmetrical weakness between right and left sides doing the one-arm bench is actually exactly what you to try to bring that strength up so there with this tweak third up on our little subtle tweaks here of exercises in the farmer farmers carry I see guys do farmers carry all the time athletes love this exercise for good reasons it way to build your forearm and grip and hand strength and also to actually start building up your traps and upper body as well but you can amount of weight because it goes back to the original exercise that we talked about with the side lateral raise you to balance your two symmetrical and I know as a strength coach in a sports world you very rarely get an opportunity to be balanced in operating in a very balanced situation you with asymmetrical forces and we can do that and we can reenact that by just grabbing two slightly different weights so if we have a 60 pound or one hand grab thirty pound fifty percent of the weight in the left hand and now do the exercise now perform the same length carry that you would you challenge because you want to be tilting to one side you want to make sure that you fight it and keep it straight the whole time so again a very very simple tweak easy to do just grab two different dumbbells you effect going on with that farmers carry next the first of two back exercises that I love to sort of mix up a little bit to get that core really firing and the first one is on a standard one-arm dumbbell row now yes there is some anti rotation going on when you perform this exercise to make sure that your body doesn floor with the dumbbell as you lower but look at what knee on the bench I on the bench I position there and as we probably can tell by now the theme here is stability is not your friend when you work your abs you want to be unstable because your abs will provide that stability for you if you give them that opportunity so what I do is I like to perform my one-arm rose with an Olympic barbell setup it the ABS a lot more because we ourselves in an unsupported environment you can see right off the bat that other hand is now free it not afforded the opportunity to provide me with stability that other knee that was normally on the bench is now no longer afforded that opportunity to provide me with stability so I am free standing and having to manage all that weight but I don those other guys to help you out but that so much better we can get that core working again without sacrificing the weight that we would normally use on the exercise with the benefits that we looking for in our back in the first place last but not least one of my favorite back tweaks here for getting our core to really really work when we pull-up you know what the V bar looks like it here you know you throw it over the top of a bar and then you come up on the right side and then you come up on the left side and you alternately go until you fail and that a great way to work your back but there all you don pull-up bar but you don a bar so less equipment and you can get your core working that much harder all you have to do is grab the bar with both hands one over one under okay so you got one on this side of the bar and one on this side of the bar naturally if you just let your body rest you see that your body will twist Torro in one direction okay will twist towards the forward-facing hand alright the bar on the front side of the bar if you want to work your core all you have to do is fight that don happen keep yourself facing straight out to the side here so if your hands are this way you and don that alone it work that much harder yes you can still come up on both sides you can still perform the same exact exercise but you you different way because you your hands again in this balance position right out one on one side of the bar and one on the other you kind of got them in line which is going to cause that torque that you going to fight your abs are going to be rewarded for doing that so there you have it guys five subtle ways to get your core working much harder than it is right now and all you got to do is just change the way you that you you want to get your core popping and you want those ABS to start showing as I say we got to have the nutrition plan we have that for you in the athlean-x system we out to help you to get them to show but you got to get them working and get into working more frequently alright training volume of the ABS is essential and we can do that through daily lab work or at least five or six days of ab training but you also have to have your supplementary ab training that puts your core into the middle of whatever it is you core of everything you just a saying it that by training your abs through your actual workouts and doing the exercises that demand that your core fires and functions the way it should so that you can perform the exercise at its best we do that guys in a plane access with the whole system is all about it training you like an athlete if you looking for more than just five ways to get your body training at its best in getting your core popping and seeing results much much faster in your midsection then head to athleanx.com right now and start training with me tell you guys there could be doing that a lot of us just are it not because we don because we don exists in the first place that to help show you guys what those are if you found this

SIX PACK ABS TRAINING (Complete Guide!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmR7_NZPrHs	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com I get the question all the time of Jeff am I doing the right ab workout and then they different exercises that they and say is this good or what do you think I can unless I know what your goals are and here at athlet X you guys know we train professional athletes and we help guys that want to look like professional athletes they want to get a ripped six-pack they want to build athletic muscle well if if that is your end goal regardless of whether you plan on having a career at it or not you got to train like an athlete we say that all the time and for ab training guys that incorporates a lot of different types of exercises and functions of the ABS so today what I wanted to do is show you all the different functions of the ABS and start to illustrate a lot of the different ways that you could be spending your time if you trying to train like an athlete depending upon what so if you want to know what those main functions of the ABS are you have strength goals for your abs if you want to make them stronger you have endurance you got to have AB endurance to there times when you have the ability to accelerate your with generate lots of force through your ABS anti-rotational control and stability a very very key component of ab training and finally you have to make sure that you have reactive strength and for a lot of my MMA athletes and Fighters reactive strength is where it that most guys train for one or at Max two see at athlet X again we cover them all through all of our programs and all the different types so I want to take you through each one of these things just to give you an idea of what it is that we about so first up is strength and with strength you weighted ab exercises and a lot of guys will avoid weighted ab exercises thinking that doing them will bulk up their abs it guys there hypertrophy capacity in your abdominal muscles and on top of that building your abs out a little bit if you maintain a low body fat will actually help you to get a those that appearance of deeper grooves because you the muscles to build themselves out a little away from the surface so it a bad thing and here you see me showing you two of the exercises the first up is called an otus up with the otus up it sort of like the beginning of uh a Turkish get up where you have a dumbbell in your hand here I you a zero momentum State the ability to contract your abs and get your body off the ground up to a seated position the arm will rise up as you go up so that it stays in line with your body and Up Against Gravity obviously when you want to put it out in front of you or you starting to test your shoulder strength more than your ab strength then we transition over to one of the ones that I our gymnast ABS exercise and here you just anchor a dumbbell in between your feet get up onto a dip bar you basically doing nothing with your arms at all other than stabilizing and here you to Crunch from the bottom up and pull up your torso pull up your your pelvis into a posterior tilt that will engage the lower abs generally the Reps in here in the 10 to 12 rep range if you to go for hypertrophy or maybe even a little bit heavier if you strength next up we resilience or anti-rotational capacity of our abs and it important especially for athletes because we before the most important thing you can prevent when you classic strength lifts is energy leak through your core because most everything we do starts if it body exercise the poers generated from the ground up if it exercise a lot of times the power is generated out here in our fingertips and it transfer all the way through to a stable base on the ground so we have to make sure that there through the core and being able to resist that and have anti-rotational stability through your core is key you can see a few great ways to do that right here and the first one is with our bar walks and this is a really cool exercise you bar to rest up against your pelvis and we know that when we walk we get rotation of the pelvis we shifting right to left right to left as we step forward well the same thing happens here with the bar it mimicking that movement what we want to try to do is limit the amount of motion that occurs with the bar it wants to swing you get the momentum going in One Direction because of the weight of the bar try not to allow it to move so much contract your abs and prevent excessive Motion in One Direction or the other you want to make it harder do what I showing you here pull the bar up overhead that makes it even a lot tougher now we that our bar is away from our ABS we make that a lot tougher for our ABS to control but of course if you got the strength go for it try the harder version and then an exercise that sort of illustrates one of the key things I think guys often do wrong with a medball throw right if you the wall a lot of times guys will allow themselves to to recoil all the way back in the direction that they started but if you want to start developing your resilience of your abs try to throw it against the wall with as much explosion as you can and then control or prevent the back rotation that happens when you catch the ball so you can see me really struggling to try not to allow the ball to continue in the in the direction that I off the bounce of course having the ability to generate accelerative force from a non-moving state is not only important for our athletes obviously uh hitters and baseball even pitchers uh quarterbacks and football anybody that has to generate a lot of force from a pretty stationary position obviously Fighters as well but also for the guys that are just looking to get better ABS because again if we complete AB development that you after you got to make sure you addressing all these things well the cool thing about the ab throw and the medball throw is it actually works that way as well you momentum State and you to generate as much force as you possibly can so there it works sort of a same exercise Dual Purpose on the endurance side of things we know how important it is for our ABS to be able to be on call whenever needed and in order to do that and realize the fact that our abs are on call pretty much all day whenever we whenever we you have to realize that endurance is a key component and here we attack it with just a couple exercise examples this is an e Centric leg raise where we actually control The Descent of the legs on the way down yeah you get them up to the top of course making sure to poster rotate the pelvis and not just lift from the legs but also to really concentrate on the lowering on the way down and then we can go over to a wall do something we call a wall plant Plank by planting our feet into the wall it way to get a nice closed chain position for our plank so not just relying on the tips of our toes but the balls of our feet and our feet flat up against the wall but here we try to hold and maintain the more difficult version of the plank and just see how long we can do it and finally one of the biggest components of athleticism is our ability to absorb Force through our abs and also recover because even speed and foot quickness is dependent upon the ability of your abs to be reactive so if I get knocked in One Direction if I have lack of strength through my abs and I kind of have to really take a long time to absorb that that hit that I took before I can regain control of my body and then move in the other direction I be obviously slower than somebody that has real good reactive core strength where I can take that hit quickly contract and get myself back in the other direction I that person right off the bat well we have a lot of ways that we can train reactive AB strength as well and again it guys that want to have complete AB development and we work all these things into all of our training programs because I feel it to do that a couple examples here are pounding planks you can see in a pounding plank I Force into the med ball with every single hit of my hand on top of the ball and then we move over to the ball here and that ability to recover from these different various movements we could do it by spelling out the alphabet with our arms just position yourself with your forearms on top of the physio ball and now I those little motions to make the C and the D and the E especially and there now we control if we control through our core to make sure that we can do nothing but spell letters and not fall flat on our face and then of course we can file that up with our pingpong slams and this is just a great way to absorb Force this is great for Fighters you take the brunt of that Force as I slam the ball into the wall either right or left it doesn matter and quickly be able to reverse Direction and get it back to the other side sometimes guys will slam this ball into the wall and they themselves forward they reposition their feet because they can even absorb the force through their through their abs alone they need to get help from down below so as you can see guys there real simple answer to the question of Jeff am I doing the right ab workout and then simply listing a few exercises for me because there that go into developing abs and when I saying developing ABS I mean complete abs and as we do here as I say all the time we train like athletes there lot of components to developing athletic ABS but I will tell you this if you can do it you looking ABS you you functionally strong and be able to do anything that what that is guys I can prepare you to train like an athlete even if you don want to step on the field of competition if you simply want to look like one head to athlet next.com and start training like one guys if you found this video helpful make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below and let me know what you want to see we making

Six Pack Ab ÂHackÂ (ABS NOT REQUIRED!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuYeBkOx-Mk	ATHLEAN - X	what today we got a muscle hack for you it the six-pack hack you know when you don but you can to make it look like you do okay I not going to break out the muscle marker and draw that are going to make it easier by focusing on not the six-pack you see the six-pack is the rectus abdominis and this muscle alone will never give you a good-looking midsection if you don at this picture right here this guy clearly has some ABS but because he lacking obliques and seratus anterior two muscles that I lot of other times on this channel it does doesn probably not what you were thinking of when you said I want to have a rip six-pack but this guy here probably with even a little slightly less AB development looks far better because he tying in and Visually creating a tapering and a narrowing of that midsection and framing out that six-pack a lot better we concept before well today I want to give you one exercise that you can do either with nothing at all if you working out at home in an empty space or with a single physio ball that can actually get this working better here what it looks like you get down on the ground you now there crunches but they do one of two things either grab their neck and they just start cranking away like this with no real care about what muscles are actually doing the movement or they just worried about what down here at the waist and they focusing on the other opportunity they have and that is to get the seratus working as well so what you want to do is do your side crunch and instead of just doing it here where I again mostly on Contracting the obliques which would be a good step up than just grabbing that neck we want to add that next layer in and we can do that by taking our arm Reaching Across our body and then trying to reach out away from us that now if you remember when we cover cover the chest we have a push-up plus and the push-up plus is when we get to the top of the push-up and then try to push even further allow our shoulder blades to kind of continue to protract and go around our body the same thing Happening Here We crunch up we work the obliques we take our arm we press across our body not just to here but as far as we can go and you can actually see the activation kick in if you want to do this resistant and like I said if you going to do this in the gym you have the opportunity to use a phiz ball as well or even at home you can do this you put the ball against something sturdy here I got a wall and now as I come up and crunch now I push into the ball which is going to provide resistance for me so we get even a little bit more work for the seratus the idea here though is you want to make sure that you because these muscles that reside up here are actually going to be much more visible at higher body fat percentages we all know for guys one of the most stubborn areas is the lower belly it the last to come off and if you relying on that alone to be able to show off that impressive six-pack it could be a long long time but if you had at least a little bit a visual muscle popping through here which can happen at higher body fat levels if you just train them you can actually start to get some of that uh that midsection tapering going on to give you the appearance that you direction as I said that other video that I covered over here the Holy Trinity of ab training that you to want to look at for more advanced versions of this because it doesn start here and stay here as always with everything we do it starts and it evolves and it continues to evolve and it continues to challenge you always want to do that with all of your training but this presents a great opportunity for anybody with no barrier of Entry no equipment needed at all if you want to just start getting this working for you right now guys if you looking for a program that walks you through everything step by step and progresses you as you athletex training program that athl next.com in the meantime if you found this video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know what else you want me to cover here on this channel and I that for you in the days and weeks ahead all right I	Success
Core Strength Secret (THE HIP HINGE!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esGYTeI6r14	ATHLEAN - X	what dcom today look who made it here to the brand new Xbox and we hip hinge is critically important when you and strength of your core yes this is a washboard Wednesday video and we going to talk really about the ABS at all we functioning of the joints Below in this case and also above when it comes to trying to make sure that we have the Optimal Performance of the area in question in the middle so if we think about a hip hinge why is a hip hinge so important because we want to be able to maintain the stability of our low back without compromising the stability of our low back okay because if we lack Mobility through a joint below as we might with a hip hinge we don mobility there then we compromising the stability of the low back to do that that get low low back issues and pain same thing that could be said for above we cover in a different video If you lack the mobility through your thoracic spine to rotate again we need to get that Mobility somewhere else down here in the core again compromising stability for Mobility somewhere else that too the hip hinge though comes in so critically important when it comes to all of our big lifts if you do a bent row you need to be able to have stability and strength through your core to perform that exercise without injuring our low back or the same thing can be said with a deadlift but far too often that people who lose that stability through their core they can loads and it winds up compromising the the safety and health of their low back to hip hinge you have to look at Raymond first and see what natural curvature of your low back most of us have a natural curvature of our low back some of us have flatter backs than others but whatever your natural curvature of your low back is that what you throughout all of your other lifts that your low back so for me I have a similar curve here to Raymond it it follows this inward pattern now when I bend over to do an exercise like a bent row if I one and only goal is to maintain the position here as I lift if the Lo load starts to get too heavy and I start to do that now I compromising my lower back at some point same thing with the deadlift if I can get in that position and hold and maintain it then that way we do this I of the way is you want to make sure that when you get into this position that all the movement comes from the hips so that you have this the mobility through the hips to get yourself into this position and still maintain the stability without having to give it up here through the core and the low back so the hip hinge needs to take place all the way until we can get our butt all the way back there bending my knees to get myself back all I basically pushing from here straight back and going as far back as I possibly can to then get myself in position to be stable now to lift do a deadlift whatever else it might be but people don one big complicating factor that comes up that prevents it is hamstring flexibility again if we look back at Raymond we see that the hamstrings will attach right here to the bottom of the pelvis so if the pelvis is back this way into a hip hinge we basically lengthen the hamstrings if I do this the hamstrings now have to get longer okay now the further back I go the more I pulling that hamstring further away from its insertion so there of a pull at some point I can hips back anymore so they kind of try to curl under because they want to relieve the tension so if you have a difficult time getting into the hip hinge you might want to first of all check your own hamstring flexibility if that a problem for you and you just don know the mechanics of it all you got to do is this okay and I insult you here or give you the old DX chop what I what you have to do to mirror the move or mimic the move you push yourself right here allow your hips to go backwards and you there here at the top of the hip flexor area okay when you feel those creases soon as you create them put your hands right in them now stand upright now push through the creases as you allow your butt to travel back you should feel immediately that all the Motions happening right here at the pelvis and the pelvis is traveling backwards again you might feel a little bit of a stretch in the hamstrings if that your hamstrings out of this anterior tilt position so you can actually have a functional carryover we right here I go all the way down as far back as I can and you compromised from the low back that was maintained from here all the way back all the way back all the way back I didn myself back there that difference if I had to go like this and round my back give up some of the stability to allow myself to get back CU now I can get way further back it starting to look uh uh vulgar here with my boy Ray sorry about that right but we we just basically want to make sure that we get it and that Master this try this stretch those hamstrings out from the anterior position if you have to but most of all practice the hip hinge do this a little bit and you get your body in the position you need to be and then therefore allow your abs to be as strong and powerful and protective as they possibly can be guys if you found this video helpful make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below and head to aex.com if you looking for a training system that puts the science back in strength that lets Ray do a little bit of the talking to help us understand why we want to do the things we do in

Med Ball Workout (5 MOVES TO A 6 PACK!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZVvtfqoaY4	ATHLEAN - X	what you know don a great tool for getting a good ab work at in you know a lot of people like to kind of get out with the old and in with the new but the med ball is going nowhere it to be able to use for your abs I to show you here four exercises you can do to get a great medball workout in and all you need is just a little bit of space around your own body now I don care what weight med ball you the first exercise up is going to be a hollow Rock and again if you beginner here what you do is you pull the ball in towards your chest as you get stronger you can start to raise the ball further and further over your head and not just up over your head but back behind your head you can see that I have to be able to resist and control that ball as I rock back on every single rep beyond that now we can make this a little bit more explosive now we can pull our knees into the chest and as we shoot our legs out we throw the ball up again how you throw it and where you throw it is going to stress the ABS differently if I throw it straight overhead it is more work for my abs to be able to catch that and stabilize that on every single rep if I throw it back behind my head even more it be even more difficult for me to sort of catch that and prevent the weight from pulling my body backwards my abs have to work even harder and here it gets even more explosive as I turn this into a Russian ball slam to one side now we have even a little bit more of a plyometric action here I have to not just generate power to slam this ball down to the side but then have the ability to stabilize and control that ball to regroup and throw it down again when I reach failure on that one side I don side and I do the same thing until I burn out over there too now if you want to get a little trickier now you could actually start to slam in all three directions you going slam to the left you slam to the center and you slam to the right the legs are sort of performing a scissor which by itself can be a difficult ab exercise now I will caution you watch that middle slam there middle there you hit with the ball if you don ability to do this no big deal then slam left and slam right in alternating fashion but if you can bring it down the middle then go for it and then finally we have our three-way raise here you going to come all the way up to the top in a high V up with that ball now on the way back down you come up the next time and you drop that ball onto your legs and you leave it there we now have basically a weighted 9090 crunch you have to be able to hold your legs up there against the weight of that ball you come up the next time you do a regular crunch go back down come up grab the ball go down and repeat all over again and keep going until you can anymore so there you have it guys there is a great ab workout you can do with just a medicine ball don ever tell you that it it it absolutely works it applying resistance to your abs and a lot of times if you doing regular AB training and you don apply resistance that getting new any new results cuz you not challenging yourself this is a great way to do it guys if you a complete program that challenges you every step of the way then click the link below this video use our program selector and find the program that is best suited to the goals that you are following right now what is it that you want to achieve I will match those goals and help you get there faster than what you right now in the meantime if you found the video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know what you want to see on the in future videos and I the days and weeks ahead all right guys see you soon	Success
Plank Progression - From Rookie to RIPPED ABS in 7 Minutes with Planks!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVrALzPc7dM	ATHLEAN - X	seeing how long you can hold the plank is a great way to test how strong your core really is but the kind of point that you the real story you what athleanx.com today I want to talk to you about planks yes we know that they good way to measure your core strength and a lot of people use it as a time to test to see how long you can hold it for but to me it doesn much it doing because slight variations in your body and the way that you position it can make the exercise completely different so let me take you down and show you exactly how this works out and how you can make a more challenging as you get stronger and remember that what athlean-x is all about it just throwing some program at you and saying hey go get them guys good luck it so that showing you the science behind the strength since you can always make an exercise more difficult and continue to grow with the program not about having just a 90-day program that you done without for 90 days so now first and foremost we basic as it gets in rehab someone trying to try to get back a little bit of core strength they start off in that quadrant head position hands knees straight down now what this and we put your feet out behind you it that now by bringing my feet back more behind me that lever arm on the ABS are doing the work is longer so now I have to work a little bit harder in this position and what you you back of your head flat level you know with your shoulder blades and with your tailbone so that everything sort of sits straight this angle now if you have a little bit longer arms you angle up a little bit but that as long as you straight you break and sag down you should be okay now people ask is this more difficult or why is this more difficult or less difficult than any other variation well if you bring it straight down into the ground now you have another another aspect that the strength of the chest and mechanical advantage that you had up here right if you have our chest in play that can help out a lot and our shoulder blade are supported by our arms in other words the structure of our of our back here in our shoulder blades can pretty much almost rest in the joint right here it actually going to compress on the floor so it than it is here now I take the chest out of it for the most part now relying a lot more of the abs to hold the plank and this kind of area in here is now more dependent as well the inner scapular area because I don ability to sort of again rest and lock into the joints and now have to rely more on the strength in the area between my shoulder blades so this is a more difficult variation now if I want to make that a little bit harder I got to change the elevation angle so that now up onto a bench what this does is increases the likelihood that I would sag to succumb to the you know gravity basically so that now I got a bigger potential to resent you know cave-in so now I got to just even more to the core in order to be able to hold that ok another element that you can continue to progress to is your base of support the wider your base of support I easier the exercise is so if I my hands out here and my feet wide I longer than I can if everything is in nice and close together because now I have a tendency to rock side to side and I have to prevent that so more muscles more more work to do that and same thing back up here too this is an easier version than everything stacked together so we talked about lever arm we talked about base of support what if we did one killer variation you know that no exercise no athlean-x video is complete without one so let challenge here we incorporate all that we narrow the base of support and we going to lengthen that lever arm we going to do that by taking out a weight plate holding out front of us here in doing our plank in that way so again wait played out in front of you lengthen the lever arm feet behind me lengthen the lever arm face the support very narrow okay suspension remember when I put my feet up on the bench we had a suspension about hands up off the ground suspension so there more work being done this is kind of a combination of all those things right here come out feet behind they know a lot more difficult you got a stabilizes plate down so next time someone ask you how long can you hold the plank say what kind because the kind of life that you a much dressing you know difference between the way it feels on your body and how good you can do on it and this is the point of athlean-x training asking somebody how much do you bench right they you are I know as an athlete there are so many ways that I can expose a weakness in you regardless of how much you bench if you want to start looking like an athlete you got to start training like one it going to expose a lot of different areas that how much you bench is not going to cover and the same thing here how long can you hold a plank it cover if you really want to fortify your body and be as that leg on the outside as you are on the inside you have to start following a program that does that and hopefully has the many guys on team athlean already know we done that we put that together in athleanx i look for you to join us here on team athlean guys we back here next week another video keep your feedback coming tell me how long you can hold that plank that I just did I guys here seven you	Success

The Forgotten Core Exercises (NOT ABS!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvJxS2951P4	ATHLEAN - X	what x.com the other day we did a video where we talked about how a bad bat can truly undermine your training unless you are training it the right way and I did refer to at one point in the video the value of having a strong core and not just the core that you might Define as the core right we about the ABS and the obl but we gotta consider everything from the hips up into the shoulders if we want to really factor in everything we need to to get stronger and prevent low back pain from recurring in our workouts well I think one of the most overlooked and forgotten core muscles if we is the glute medius which is a muscle here that lies in the hips underneath the bigger glute Maximus that we all know and are familiar with and this muscle here is incredibly important when it comes to providing the stability of our pelvis that we need to have not only a stronger core but to not shift the brunt of the of the responsibility up to the back which is what eventually will lead to those back pain uh and and back degenerations so what do we do for it well first of all the gluten medius it function is to stabilize the pelvis as I said and we bottom up and if we look at it every time we lift a leg up so if I were to lift up my left leg here my pelvis wants to fall to that side because we don have that dual support anymore from below so it just wants to fall in the direction of the lifted leg well think about how many times a day you lift your leg every every single time you take a step or if you you top of that but you have to be able to keep a stable pelvis and we do that with our glute medius on the opposite side the grounded leg so we want to be able to keep a pelvis that we lift our leg off the ground and when we have a real weakness of the glut medius we start to get this dropping here even ever so slight that will lead to a breakdown and a shifting of that responsibility up the chain there are some things we can do about this and it start start with just a very easy body weight uh version of this and we don need a lot of space you don of time and what I could do this multiple times throughout the day you know without trying to add to your overall training time or volume if you have to do is position yourself next to something stable so pretend there wall over here you stand on your opposite leg and now you allow yourself to just drop in the direction that it wants to if you stop let letting your gluten medus do the work you would get this hip drop out to the side like I talked about the drill here the exercise is just to contract your way back to a level pelvis okay if you want to exaggerate you can go even a little bit higher but you contraction comes right here through that glute medius and you treat it as a high rep exercise we try to work it back up to about 50 reps here in continuous fashion and you squat a lot of weight at the pro level will be debilitated by this by about 20 reps but see if you can allow the burn you know and and fight the burn and work your way through until you can get all the way up to 50 reps and you work on both sides and then we could take it and we can make it a little bit more difficult make a resisted version of this and actually a little bit more functional version of this by doing what we call a paloff press and with this you just take a band you attach it again somewhere stable to the side of you and we planes of motion here we on that that side okay and we to press out and what it wants to do is again pull me in this direction down to this Direction that doing it same time when I press out is trying to get a little bit of a rotation and turn me in that direction so we got two forces now that we do we not want the hips to drop there we want to let the glute medius work but then we have to control the rotation every time I press out that it wants to try to pull me that way so now we making it a lot more uh athletic and we we presses here you try to go for about 15 presses straight out in front of you then we change the direction of the floor so now we take our press and we my hips are on fire as I talk about this and I press up let go a little bit closer I press straight up here okay so now as I drive it up now it wants to pull me down that way so I have to be able to support but also work in the frontal plane here too so I again two degrees of motion here and really it sets my my hips on fire so I push it straight up guys the whole thing about this though is guys will go crazy with their core training and say oh I working my core I know I balance you know dumbbell curls and things like that remember there and a place for everything just because you mean that you stability because if you leg training on a curl with the effect of trying to improve your biceps you actually doing kind of a [\\xa0__\\xa0] job on both sides of it because you really strengthening your biceps as much as you can because the instability From Below is compromising that and you not doing a real good job on working these these glute Med uh exercises the way you should be if you dial it back a little bit and do what I of robbing Peter to pay Paul and you getting a poor job uh on both ends if you want to do hip stability especially if you have a back injury and coming back from a back injury I highly suggest you do then treat it as such give it its own little routine give it its own little time and work on these things again five minutes 6 minutes is all it going to take but work on it multiple times a week and you with your training guys if you looking for a plan that kind of lays it all out and shows you how to train like an athlete CU as I said even athletes sometimes Overlook the importance of these smaller muscles and these smaller routines just how much they impact the big picture head to athl x.com right now and get our athletex training

Your Abs are Weak (EVEN IF YOUÂVE GOT A 6 PACK!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMgqxxuhd-Q	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com so i you today all right I want you to tell me which of these two guys this one right here or this one here have stronger abs now you have to pick one I a second okay now if you watching this channel for any length of time you probably said Jeff I don who wouldn them it that has the six-pack now even though we here at this channel train guys to be lean we also predominantly want them to be athletic and strong first and foremost because we train athletes here and I can guarantee you I gym with a great six-pack and B weak as hell so what I want to help you to do today is get stronger get your core to be as strong as possible regardless of whether you have a six-pack your nutrition that what it looks like ultimately but you have to make sure you set the foundation first so here want it to establish some benchmarks and I know that not all of us have six packs that are watching this video but we all ultimately want to have a stronger core because of all the benefits that come along with it so can you do what I gonna ask you to do here remember the ABS are an anti muscle group they want to control motion and all three planes and if we start right here we can start to control extension we don allow our body to overextend so the as play a key role in doing that and by doing this banded barbell rollout we use this as a benchmark with our athletes to say how strong on you can you actually get out there hold it for a split second roll it back in and actually start to produce reps here and I want you to be able to do that if you can right now it need to work more on your ab strength even if your your six-pack is showing at the moment now again I realized that everyone watching this right now doesn necessarily have the strongest ABS in the world but you have to have a benchmark as well at least so you can get to that point and what I want you to do is just drop down to your knees and try the same thing can you do this even if just without the band on it can you do a roll out from your knees and establish that end position without allowing that low back to sag and break into an over extension right now that others the next one is the all-important rotational plane and I want to know can you control rotation can you prevent over rotation and we have here this overhead grapevine and what we is we and we weight we more advanced guys I want you holding at least a little bit over half of your body weight and you could do it either with dumbbells or you could do it with a barbell which is going to be more difficult why because the barbell is gonna get more momentum any little bit of rotation you get going in one direction you slow the momentum of the barbell as well you want to walk in a nice tight grapevine without over rotating and of course you can walk both down leading with your right leg and back leading with your left leg for those beginners a little bit less than a quarter of your bodyweight is a good place to start and I your bodyweight was 160 pounds it pounds or less total in your hand so obviously 20 pound dumbbells in each hand okay that single barbell if you for a 45 pound weight now we need to go to anti lateral and we anti lateral control can be done here with a single band in a squat rack set up and what we leg raise with the band pulling us to one side now you test both sides but again I want our athletes to be able to get and be able to do reps here with our legs going as straight forward as possible resisting the pull both to the side and a little bit back right we the way back we of that flexion from the ABS themselves so can you do that and again beginners maybe you just have to start with the ability to do a non swinging hanging leg raise actually made a whole video about how to get more control over the hanging leg raise in the hanging knee raise and prevent the swing actually link that for you guys at the end of this video so the idea is these are the benchmarks and again ultimately you want to be able to get to the point where you can hold these for time you can rep these out and if you be an indicator to you that maybe even though my ass may look they and if you don gonna be any carryover or benefit just go see what happens when you go try to squat or perform a deadlift and you don will be significantly impaired by not having stability I now you get better at these lifts I promise you the next time you get under the bar in a squat or get over the bar on a deadlift you at that lift period the stability will equal strength guys on this channel it about training athletes I want you guys to train like an athlete as well and more importantly I want you to function and feel like one if you looking for a step-by-step program that does that for you head over to athleanx.com as a physical therapist I take all this into consideration because it all matters all of our programs lay it out for you in a step-by-step fashion in the meantime if you found the video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know what else you want me to

Weightlifting Belts | Weak Abs (UH-OH!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBgv30fkD7c	ATHLEAN - X	what it talking weight belts and I about how this weight belt might be making your weight belt weaker you see you actually have a weight belt that never cost you a penny and you carry it around with you all the time it transverse abdominus but by relying on this far too often you to weaken that and have it cost you at the moment that it matters the most on your big lifts when you would actually reach for this one you see the transverse abdominus is a muscle that lays right here under the rib cage and it wraps all the way around our body and through the magic of the muscle marker we can actually see what it looks like it actually comes right here all the way around and as you can see the orientation of the fibers is such that it lays just like a w belt would and it actually functions the same way it doesn what it does is it actually takes our body and it cinches it in so it does this it does the same thing that a weight belt would do as you pull it tighter it our abdomen in tighter which will provide this circular stability of the spine and core so if we train that muscle you want to learn how to actually contract it so that it actually flattens the belly down okay so what it does is it takes this belly from being out here and it learns to flatten it down provide stability that again wraps all the way around I teach you how to do this through a lot of our lower ab exercises and M matter of fact most of our ab exercises in this video that I covered over here you to watch that and see how we do that specifically but the importance of this video is to get you understanding the fact that the more of this that you use the more you completely counteracting what you actually trying to accomplish in the first place and that is stability if you wear a weight belt the first thing that happens is if you wear it appropriately you bit of extra room in here you never want to pull it all the way tight like this cuz you actually don room to push out against this with this intraabdominal pressure so you have it a little bit bit loose so that now you can push into it and then have that pressure against the pad which is pushing back in the opposite directions giving you that extra torque in spinal stability if you do that think about what you doing you with a distended belly you yourself this way to push out as you stabilize when in actuality the healthier more protected spine has the ability to Bear down and still have that intraabdominal pressure but with a flatter belly because you have the contraction the transverse abdominus so that to rely on the weight belt but the second one is overuse of this is just going to make inactivity of the transverse abdominis and it result in a weaker transverse abdominis so you couldn it so I weight belt here would say it with a history of back pain whether you had surgeries lumbar Fusion disectomy uh significant back injuries that have laid you up for a significant period of time then I would say it as you get yourself back into training from that injury but only if you agree that you directly and increase the strength of your transverse abdominus like I showed you in that video that I linked over there with the focus of building that up over time so you can wean yourself off of this use this as a as a crutch to get you back in the game again on the other end of spectrum if you powerlifter there that we again covered on the Instagram profile that will allow you to generate even just a little bit more force in your lift that will increase your lift total by even a small amount that could mean the difference between first place and third place or setting a new PR in those cases you can train there but not a lot of the guys that are watching this channel are competitively powerlifting at that degree a lot of them are watching to to just get either bigger stronger faster more athletic and again athletic you these out with you on the on the playing field or at least not comfortably so we don reliant on this I want to train you like an athlete to rely on the one that you have with you all the time so guys I hope you found this video helpful hopefully for those that are over reliant on their weight belts it wakeup call in the meantime if you looking for a program that will train you like an athlete and make you rely on the muscles that you have so you become more functionally strong and capable of performing at a moment you have everything that you have with you all the time and you use it that athletex training system if you want to see anything else covered here in a washboard Wednesday you make sure you leave it in the comments below I my best to bring those to you in the weeks ahead all right guys I again real soon	Success
Ripped Six Pack & Obliques (THE ÂXÂ EFFECT!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCYr3Sq4L0w	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] What Today, we and we sarapp. The hell is a sarap? The sarra is a piece of clothing, but more importantly, it explains how the muscles work together. We always talk about train the muscles the way they prefer to work together, and that going to do here today. And we actually going to break out the muscle markers to show you how it also going to break out Jesse to help me show you how it on the other side of the camera here. You guys all know Jesse always looking dapper. Now, the thing about the muscles of the core is they prefer to work in cross pattern. So, Sarra is a scarf you wear across your neck and then it crosses over you in front. Athlete X has more than just the X in the name. It actually is how our bodies are set up. So, if I take my arms out to the side here like this and I tell Jesse, try to rotate me in one direction. So, he trying to turn me this way. Let me let me let me let him win. Okay, there. So, he that, I have to do Hold me, Jesse. I have to do this and overcome and turn back. To do that, I need the internal obliques on this side and I need the external obliques on this side. And I trying to basically Let me win this time. protract. He Not working out with me. Now I trying to protract my arm this way too. So I even have the serrus anterior. So what that does is it sets up this cross pattern where the serrus anterior goes through the external obliques, crosses through the rectus here down into the internal obliques on the opposite side. Now let So now if he way, I have to produce this counter force in the opposite direction. So now I obliques over here and my external obliques over here. And of course my uh serrus on this side as well. My rhomboids are working on the other side too. We way to the back. But now color. Now we I wasn actually set up in this X pattern. So now, how can we train this? Jesse, thank you as always. So now, how can we train this? Let me show you right here. We have something here we call Olympic twist. And this is something really cool because it Olympic bar and you start off by having the bar underhand. You a little bit of bicep work here too isometrically, but you allow your bar to stand in front of you sort of at your hips. Beginners, first time through, whatever it is for you, allow your hips to rotate with the bar. What you overcoming the momentum of the bar. That one direction that you have to control, decelerate, and then accelerate your torso back in the opposite direction. So, you we want to take it up just a notch from here, now we can lock in the hips. By locking in the hips, now there stability needed, which is a great thing because the absolutely love to provide stability. So, now the hips stay there. The to the trunk and torso will rotate in the opposite direction. Now we starting to get that stretching effect, that Sarra effect. We it because now we basically have this association between stable hips and a movable upper body, but now and of course we can train both sides here. Now we can go and take it up one more notch. Now we we the hip or just rotation in one direction of the hip and then we trying to get the opposite rotation at the shoulder. And this is really, really common. If you look at this functionally for anybody that plays a sport that throws, right? Anytime you have to lift up overhead, you can see me here. If I a pitcher, I rotate here and I raise my arm up here. I way up top. I way at the bottom. That creates that ser which creates a stretch reflex which allows me to throw more powerfully. That because they create this effect extraordinarily. So, we can train that by actually stepping out, trying to get the hips going in that direction as you see me doing here, and then raising the bar. I an overhand on the bottom hand and underhand on the top hand. And I also had to raise my arm up on the bar a little bit higher because the weight of that bar gets pretty hard to handle. But the idea is the motion is what you going for. And you simply try to work on reps in this direction. And even if you direction, you want to work on that, too, for core balance. So the muscle markers don does your anatomy. Your body is set up in a certain way for a reason, to allow you to function at your best. And if you want to do that, you got to train it. And you can train it that way by training with Athletex. We train like athletes. If you program that does that step by step, daybyday, head over to athletex.com and get your Athletex training program.

Core Carving Ab Routine (JUST 4 MINUTES!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDhad2i-o4	ATHLEAN - X	what I want to find out today how awake your core is what type of Mind muscle control do you have with the elements of your core we know by now the core is not just your abs there around your torso that control your core not having the ability to intentionally control them will set you up for disaster if you react spontaneously which is going to happen you go to lift weights in the gym or if you compete you spontaneous participation of these muscles and if you can good intentional relationship with them then they when you need them the most so there drill here called the ring of fire that was actually created a long time ago by Vince Ganda old throwback name kind of dated myself right there but the concept plays out and it good easy thing that we can do and here over a pull-up bar we athlet in elas six bands you wrap it around each wrist lock your hands together now you here okay what you just get some steady tension on the ABS but the majority of the work is not going to come from the band but from you actually Contracting as hard as you possibly can to create this my muscle connection so the first one we do is the easy one is the top down Movement we have better control here when we to doing this gravity actually helps us here we abdominals by crunching down as hard as we possibly can bringing our rib cage down over our pelvis and you really really really want to try to contract as hard as you can to the point where if it you might feel even a little bit of pain in the upper abs that for 5 to 10 seconds and without resting you now try to shift to the lower abs and to do this now what we do again one muscle group but we preferentially hitting different areas by the angle of pull so when we try to contract here we posteriorly rotate our pelvis as hard as we possibly can without letting up on that constant tension of the band and again we try to really really bear down here and hold this as long as we possibly can then we move on to the obliques we can do our internal obliques and to do our internal obliques if we working the right side as we are right now we shoulders in that same direction so if we rotating towards the right and we squeezing and Contracting as hard as we possibly can now don feel that level of discomfort that I was telling you about or you might not feel that cramping you might not feel much of anything at this point and that because you really truly need to work on that if you actually a good sign that want to get to where you can feel it on every single move we then move on to the external obliques again no resting it the ring of fire for a reason you trying to build up this burn this constant burn in your entire core you rotating now to the opposite side you can bear down and contract as hard as you possibly can here and now of course we can muscles as we wrap around to the side and the back and we did a whole video on the quadrus lumborum and how important this is this is the hip hiking muscle so what we do now is we try to drop back and rotate back and towards our back hip or our kidney area and we contract as hard as we possibly can unilaterally to that right side and before we the back to hit the spinal extenders here we work on bending back into extension to hit those paraspinal muscles right alongside of our spine and again you the ring of fire cuz you have to work your way back around to the front and then of course you got to work your way on the left side back and then back to the front again so how do we program this it put anywhere in your workouts you can actually do this prior to a lower body workout you muscles getting them to know that you that you want something from them so that when you spontaneously try to get it from them they out and of course we know how important that is to participate in stabilizing your your core during lower body movements but you can do them prior to a workout after a work a workout three to four times a week however much help you need if you neuromuscular control there you don need to do it as often if you have a poor control meaning you can of these things when you contract them then you need to start incorporating this more often guys I hope you found this video helpful again it thing to do and of course if you want to start getting more of this these types of advanced training techniques putting the science back in strength knowing when to do them head over to x.com and follow our athletex training system I lay it out for you day by day step by step and we as well meal by meal that aex.com in the meantime if you found this video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know what you want to see here on this channel and I those to you all right guys I here again soon see you	Success

Squat More Weight Instantly (ALL ABOUT ABS!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9dTRcMypNk	ATHLEAN - X	What athletex.com. So, it Wednesday and we squats. Stick with me here, guys. I promise you that this will be worth your while. You see, when you go to do your heavy lifts, if you about your abs, and I mean thinking about actually contracting your abs, you you could lift because your abs provide such an important stabilization to your big lifts that allow you to direct all of your energy towards that big lift. I talk about it all the time. These energy leaks are the bane of your progress in the gym. If you don core, you force that you put into the lift. We don that happen. If you don how much of an impact this can this can have on your squats, do this quick test for me. Stand up. Stand up right now. Stand up and just go through a body weightight squat. And I want you to do it two different ways. The first time I watch me. I want you to allow yourself to breathe in as you go down and then breathe out on the way up. We all hear that a lot that breathe out on the exertion, right? For a bench press, we be down and then we breathe out on the exertion. Well, for the squat, we think we have to breathe out on the way up. No, because that means we in on the way down. Try it right now and see how unstable you feel. Matter of fact, you might feel stable when you start and as you go down, you breathe in, you lose all the stability and you should lose a lot of strength in doing so. Now, do it the way I here. Breathe out and tighten down. Contract your abs forcefully. Be conscious of how hard you your abs. Make sure that you the air and that you from the inside out. You that intraabdominal pressure, but by doing so by tightening down the muscle, not just blowing out. Okay? There big difference. And when we do that, now go down into your squat, you should notice an immediate difference. You should feel much more stable. The squat should feel much lighter. And now it time to actually put into practice now and put the weight on the bar. And I guarantee the same thing will happen. Now I do the same thing. You want to focus on bearing down. Tighten up those abs as hard as you can and then execute the rep. Breathe out as you come to the top. If you have to reset at the top, breathe in and then out and then tighten down, then do that. It an extra second or a second and a half between the reps. As long as you getting good quality reps, that that matters. So guys, remember, even when it comes to your leg training, your abs are critically important. And they should be critically important to every single thing you do. And it important part of what we do here at Athlete X that we build core training and a core focus into every single workout in every single exercise. We call it putting core at the core of everything we do. If you a program that helps you to build a big strong core that allows you to start doing some big strong lifts better and better, then guys, head to athletex.com and start training like an athlete today. In the meantime, if you found this video helpful, make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below and tell me what else you want to see me cover here once a week. Watch more Wednesday. I right, guys. I soon.	Success

Fat Burning Ab Workout (HOME VERSION!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RWQ-iMEN1U	ATHLEAN - X	what little winded already because I already did what you second I actually did today prove a point that you can hit the best of both washboard Wednesday and body weight Wednesday in one video for a combined effect of actually training your abs burning fat in the process and also helping to build muscle because we Crea overload can come in any form it doesn Weights don that that you can do it if you carefully select the exercises that you do to create overload so how are we this we leg combo and your rest period is going to be your direct AB training so indirectly you through the choice of exercise and then directly you the rest period we start off here with a push-up it we the ABS because of course a push-up done in this position is already going to load your abs to keep your body off the ground we difficult create the overload by decreasing the point of contacts that we have with the floor we basically have three points of contact with the same amount of your body weight having to be supported by the rest of your three limbs that that too many reps throw on a weight toest if you have the opportunity to do that and now youve created additional overload take it to failure and then go directly into your 45 second sort of ab rest exercise in this case it plank here you can see that we creating an AB movement directly hitting your abs for the stability of them of course and we can make them even more complex if that incorporating this fourpoint movement with two alkaline climbers mixed in becomes a little bit more complicated because of the coordination but the load on your abs is increased and therefore more beneficial if you level you do three sets of that combo without ever resting then you move on to the pull for portion of this which is our back and bicep version we to do a pull-up we of a high pull pull-up with our knees and legs straight out so the idea here is to indirectly once again activate the ABS and keep them activated throughout you do as many of these as you can until failure as soon as you straight down beneath the pull-up bar and come up and do these knee Drive sit-ups as you come up drive your knee drive your elbow meet them in the middle and head back down to the ground come up do these 45 seconds this is your rest period between your active indirect ab work sets Okay so you overload you challenging version of the pull-up so you necessary to build upper body strength and size you do three sets of this combo and you move on to our final portion here we legs we and for the rolling squat we want to be able to keep tension here on the muscle so we half position not going to go all the way up to standing because we know that at the very top we tension on the quads and hamstrings so what we want to do is kind of stick around in the middle now I demonstrating the two-legged version here what you can do if you want more overload do it single-legged now you have a pistol squat variation of this that will definitely create overload and challenge you depending upon your your strength level again if that easy then throw on a weighted vest but the idea is you do this till failure and then if you you just alternate legs until failure you go back down and then you finish off with this Hollow Rock and in the hollow Rock you establish that position get up off the ground shoulders off the ground legs off the ground get the pelvis in contact with the ground that point and try to maintain contact as you dynamically move your weight forward and backward you do that for 45 seconds three rounds of that and now before you you puffing like I am a little bit right now but let conditioning movement let straight of jump rope if you don jump rope rope pick your poison I don care if it if it Rocket jumps whatever you want to do that going fine try to do it for 5 minutes rest intermittently as you have to but keep that rest to a minimum so there you go guys as you can see we can get the best of all worlds here we can get the best of body weight Wednesday mix with the best of washboard Wednesday throw in some fat burning and some muscle building because of the overload and at the end of the day you got a kickass workout that won long to do and won of anything maybe a doorway pull bar to get it done if you guys are looking for a lot more options things to do day by day I give you a whole step-by-step plan that actually requires no equipment at all forget even the pull-up bar nothing it aex.com a sixe program a meal plan included everything you need to build your own body with nothing but your body all right guys we just a couple days if you found this video helpful make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below if you want to see more of these combo hybrid body weight Wednesday and watch for Wednesdays just let me know and I my best to bring them to you all right I later	Success
Abs and Oblique Stretch (TIGHT ABS FIX!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-RW-8lqtnw	ATHLEAN - X	what next.com so having tight abs is probably high up on your list of priorities if you Wednesday but having tight abdominal muscles that is an entirely different story matter of fact that can create a lot of dysfunction in your other lifts and workouts you see the muscles in your core particularly the internal and external obliques and your rectus abdominis the six-pack muscle that is actually causing a problem for a lot of your other lifts if they are allowed to become short and tight and they become short and tight pretty easily because of two things number one we hardly ever stretch our ABS I to try to correct that for you here today by showing you three ways you can and secondly we sit a lot either we driving in a car on our commute to work or while we even at night we allows these muscle to become a little bit tight and we have to realize that when we look at these muscles they doing really the same thing they all have attachments origins or attachments in our rib cage and then down here in our pelvis so they take those two points when they they bring them closer together so what happens when we bring your rib cage closer to your pelvis you look like that so a lot of postural issues can come out of that actually we can lead to other things that we think might be problems that maybe aren we say oh they got no lack of thoracic extension they can thoracic spine no maybe they can extend their thoracic spine because they can their pelvis cuz they have tight abs so here addressing this I take out a fysio ball like I the top of it and a lot of you might again do this instinctively because you figure it feels good or it stretches you out a little bit but the big thing that you have to make sure you is you the pelvis so I do that by getting into the position where I first lay over the back of the ball I get that rib cage expanded I get my arms up over my head and then the key is dropping the hips dropping the pelvis further away from the rib cage so we can get that maximum stretch on the rectus abdominis and I can intensify that by just adding a nice deep breath in I see it or not while I nice deep breath in to expand the rib cage even more and again increase that stretch being felt on the rectus now what I could do is again we got to deal with the internal external obliques too because those are big muscle groups that are impacting our posture in different ways are a little bit uh slanted compared to the up and down orientation of the rectus abdominis but we can get at them too and we could get at them by just turning ourselves over and getting on the side of the ball now we get on the side of the ball the same thing happens here rib cage and pelvis separate them drop them as far away from each other as you possibly can now when you twist a little bit and lean back you can get the external obliques to be a little bit favorably stretched because you taking them away further away from the angle that they run into the uh to to the rib cage you cage further away from the pelvis where the external obliques uh attach okay and then the same thing can happen here when we go to the internal obliques you just want to roll yourself down a little bit still maintain that side Bend because the real attachment here is the iliac crest right on the side of our hips get that a little further away and again rotate downward and get away from the uh in other words elongate that internal oblique a little bit more now you don have to do this all the often cuz I bet you you at all even at the moment do a little bit more of it and I promise you you going to see benefits as it over laps into the rest of your training I mentioned in the beginning some of the dysfunction that you could see in some of your lifts by allowing yourself to get tight abs the squat is probably the best example of this if you try to squat out of the posterior tilt you immediately putting your low back in Jeopardy of injury cuz you a very compromised position that very stable position at all you want an anterior tilt out of here here so that as you lean forward right to create the right angle of the bar through your the mid the middle of your feet you to need to have a low back that slightly arched to support your spine and and keep it in a strong position you have an anterior tilt or the ability to anterior tilt and drop that pelvis down and away from your roof cage that something that we just covered is not that possible if you allow your abs to get that tight so you want to make sure that you when it comes to stretching because stretching is important for all your muscles your abs are no less important especially as we realize the implications it has for not doing them I hope you found this as a maybe an eye opener and you of the quick stretches that I showed you and if you get a little bit on that nerdy side here uh the PT side to explain these things but I think from the feedback I get from you these are the things that help you to understand why it is what you doing and I think if you understand what you from doing them and that basis of our athletex training programs is to allow you guys to understand what it is you better results from them from all of your workouts from all of your training from everything you do in and outside the gym if you training programs guys they aex.com in the meantime if you found this helpful make sure you leave your comments a thumbs up below watch for Wednesdays once a week we

The Fighter - Abs Workout (Knockout Abs Without Crunches!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HJm3znkAKs	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] h [Music] H hey guys Jeff Cavalier athlet x.com you know big movie coming out this week the boxer um with Mark Wahlberg playing Mickey Ward who I know growing up I was a big fan of Mickey Ward especially in the Arturo Gotti fights are probably the three best fights I life um Well everybody how in shape he is for this movie and I haven years or so to prepare for this role in his head to get in the shape that he wanted to but that said I think one of the critical things we can learn from boxers is how much core training is involved even when we single crunch just executing a punch now I had an opportunity to train in New York City at the Kings Way gym which is one of the greatest boxing gyms in the world with my very own Mickey his his I swear to God his name was Mickey U and he was an old Irish guy but he expert boxing trainer and one of the things that stuck with me the most was teaching me how to actually execute punches namely an upper cut like a a right Cross or a hook and then a blocking mechanism and how much core is involved when you do that so I said why don guys that you could do without ever doing a single crunch that will fire up your core more than anything else so we elastic bands the black bands again you can do it with any other band guys I not trying trying to just sell my bands here in these videos I show you things you can do but with this band it now when you do an uppercut people may think that the uppercut comes from you know punching your arm in this motion it really doesn you sort of 90° angle Bend you step in and it I my body or even breaking this angle at my arm so you and rotating up now we can just fire off about 20 of these okay we can keep it like that or we can step in each time which is technically correct so Step Up Step Up Step Up step up and you can see the core each time has to fire so we can do some really Ballistic Hard heavy rotation heavy but powerful core activation now next one the right cross again it punching straight out that doesn generate the power that we need if you want to knock somebody out you got to get your whole body involved so now what we have to do is get the lower body to Pivot with us which is going to bring the core in so it a pivot at the same time so you basically punch and pivot at the hip same time now he would always tell me keep your hands near your chin cuz that hands stay here and you punch again it that quick pivot and punch at the same time now again you can fire off without any sort of you know jumping in between just straight through let 15 get your winded but works the core another way now last thing blocking again you never want to take your hands away from your chin so you know the second you try to block someone tries to punch you in the body you go like that to block them they out so what you your chin guarded and block like here which is an obvious oblique heavy move take another elastic band the Red Band put your arm through come out a little bit and you can do the two bands together at the same time but basically get your hands up you can kind of you know box run if you have to shadow box when you to get the punch you do to drop down here down here punch comes in down so every time oblique crunch just like that so now you don boxing Maneuvers to this if you don want put a band up high take yourself out here crunch down so if you boxing thing you don Ward you don but get into your get into your flow whatever it is down and block down a block if you have both bands going at once block execut a punch block execut a punch block uppercut do that for 5 minutes continuous guys I get a very unique ab workout and again you don athlete guys to look like one you just got to train like one so all you have to do head to aex.com right now get the athletex training program learn how to execute a athletic type movements not to become a pro athlete but to look like one guys we week with some more videos uh holiday season coming up soon so we might have something holiday themed for you I see you again next [Music] week h [Music] h	Success

How to Get a Six Pack Fast - 6 Pack Attack Plan!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRnLlQT0Y5w	ATHLEAN - X	are you looking to get a six-pack fast well I can without having to rely on any shortcuts or revelations by Chinese scientists guys we rip a real muscle science to work today [Music] what athleanx.com as I said today it about how to get a six-pack fast and we those shortcuts or ancient Chinese secrets and Chinese scientists that are in a lab discovering secret ways to add muscle and all that no but what we going to do is we with real muscle science how you can start doing this by applying it to your workouts and I think when we address the ABS it start off by understanding that there a lot of different roles of the ABS and unless you are training all the rules of the ABS in your workouts or across your workouts you getting the results that you want so I put down a list here of the different roles of the ABS or the different functions that in the ways that you can attack them and we start here at the top and really we it abdominal training you want to make sure that you spine but doing it from the bottom up so what I mean by that is some sort of exercise and we bunch of these as I you are in a fixed position at the top and the bottom is doing most of the work so you flexing the spine from the bottom up this engages more of the lower abdominals gets them firing and proactively working and then it leads us into the other areas in those directions that we can train the ABS which is both up now well both up means that we going to get some sort of a kind of exercise where we can actually bring the bottom and the top up at the same time again I exercises and as I give you an example of what we we mean next top down you want to make sure that when you you flexion of the spine from the bottom portion up but you can also flex the spine from the top down remember all motion is relative in science you have something that is fixed and something that is moving and in this case we want to have both ends come and meet together another important aspect of the function of the ABS next we have the obliques if you want a to AB program if you really want to start framing out your 6-pack then you want to work the obliques as well okay the obliques are it can be attacking a lot of different ways here I you another way that you can do that again using a resistance band but the possibilities are endless next bottom up rotation this is a hugely important function of the ABS and that rotation I think it overlooked aspects of training the ABS is that we all think that it just flexes it just does crunches and that from me and the truth well how do we do it we have to incorporate rotation and we have to break it down when we looking at bottom up rotation as I demonstrating now and then as we move into the next sequence here top down rotation then top down rotation and bottom up rotation the only difference is what is relatively moving what part is fixed and what part is moving and when you do that see the difference as you do the exercises you difference and start to see it in the mirror because you the ABS in two completely different ways but they both complement each other and are both equally important finally we move on to the last two parts and components of a six pack AB you know a workout and that get one of the biggest things that ABS do is they help us to resist rotation as I do this variation of the plank you can see that my abs are working really hard to help me not rotate and again it sort of counterintuitive because we always think that everything is based on motion it main function is to prevent motion and unless you routine you again of their function finally stabilizing all other movements so we talking about every movement and your workouts should involve the ABS in some way and that athlean-x is I talked about core at the core every exercise if you properly you in every single thing you do and it going to be when you movements as I moving my lower body or doing some variation with my lower body the abs are engaged and working or can be with our upper body movements and as I show you here in this exercise we chest no doubt but as soon as I grab the handle so as I grab the handle right now you can see as soon as I grab the handle my abs start to engage that it whole rest of that movement and then they start to rotate so you crossover between the functionality of the ABS here too but the key point here guys is that in order to have an effective ab training program or to start seeing your six-pack ABS faster again relax without relying on anything that on you know not fact you need to start relying on what is true muscle science and this is how the ABS function okay as a physical therapist there different ways that we have to attack the ABS and this is our our attack plant one more thing I think we need to address because it always has to be said the only way to get a six-pack is to combine this with the proper nutrition program if you watching what you eat in the kitchen guys you might have the best developed ass but they a whole heck of a lot of fat and now is the time for the new year to start trying to uncover that guys you want to start to look at how you can change your body I want to point you to athlean-x because if you athlean-x team if you working

Feel Every Ab Exercise More (THE ABS ACTIVATOR!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAXcw3QbqWA	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what here on watch board Wednesday not just another ab workout but an ab workout tip that will apply to all of your ab workouts to help make them better matter of fact you instantly right when you what I tell you to do and that whole reason why we do these things as a coach who actually has to oversee sometimes 25 players at a time going through a single ab workout inevitably I that in my abs or I felt it in my hip flexors or my low back was feeling it why wasn you need to be able to do something about it and for the viewers out there there are a lot of people that don really feel ab work as much as they should so what you have to do is you got to try to activate that mind muscle connection before you start training your abs awaken them we talk about it with the the glutes a lot glute Amnesia you can have AB Amnesia as well so it depends on where you workout if you workout on the floor some floor-based ad workout or EX exercise then this is what you want to do and I said it was simple I wasn just activate the ABS by elevating your torso off the ground and hold it for 2 minutes 3 minutes if you can it difficult but you feel the ABS awaken and activate just by holding this position and when I say this position I blades completely cleared off the floor I don blade nothing making contact with the floor you hold it here and then you proceed into your first exercise no matter what that is if you the aex system we have actually will start with a lower up a bottom up movement but the idea is that you just Awakening them so when you do the exercises you feel them much much more if you your workout is going to be a hanging bar based ab workout well then you do this instead you hang from the bar you get your arms at is as far down as they possibly can without over stretching your shoulder if you have a shoulder issue and you mini rotations left to right your abs are going to have to awaken and contract especially your obliques to control the rotation right and left that will again serve the same purpose now you might only be limited to let hanging from the bar because your grip strength but that that you have then Shake It Off get your arms loose get back up on the bar and proceed into your first ab exercise again instantly you activation and more from your hanging bar ab exercises and maybe you a captain the gym and you always like the way that thing looked and you see a lot of other people using it okay fine you to get on the captain you movement and what you do is just tuck your ab Up and Under pull your pelvis Up and Under and just hold this position here this should not be that difficult to hold either because you the lockout strength of your triceps to maintain this position of your torso aim for 1 minute 2 minutes or or up to 3 minutes if you have the ability to do that this one will probably be a little bit harder obviously than the first one but from there you instantly go into your workouts and and the fact is this guys that if you can figure out ways to allow your body to connect more with the muscle you to get more out of it and then doing so you of your workout cuz a lot of us spend the first half of our workout trying to dial into the muscle we by the time we finally have the workouts over so we can start doing that effectively from the very beginning without having to spend a lot of time and certainly not that much effort here so try this out I down in terms of allowing someone who isn of the work in an ab workout after doing this they actually start to feel it right away so try it out I promise you the meantime if you program that puts the science back in strength that allows you to get more out of all your workouts head to aex.com right now and get our athex training program all right guys we here again in just a couple days uh leave your comments below let me know what you want to see and I to cover in the days and weeks ahead all right I	Success

I Hate Ab Workouts (5 REASONS NOT TO!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hQCaQBfMcY	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com so maybe you guys out there watch it watch board Wednesday that hates training their abs believe it or not there out there and there why either you don feels when you train your abs the burn that you get is just so unpleasant that you try to avoid it at all cost or more likely you look I that I day and that do it I more bang for my buck I my entire body and like let the ABS kind of fall where they may you don don choice because I ways that even guys that hate training their abs can start training them starting today okay kick it off this list at number five is staggered ab training this is really really easy to do because if you think about what it is that you do between your sets you realize wow what a great opportunity you have to do something that you haven been doing and that is your abs you can take any exercise any workout right here I a set of squats and as miserable as it may seem I go over here and I do have my rest period to grab onto a bar and do some lower ab work now my abs are very rested here yes they squat but not to the extent that you going to be working them here so they not pretty fatigued you can go bang out your set here take a little extra time get back into your squats again if you going to want to take a little bit of extra time between your sets as it is so why don two to three minutes you might be hanging out in between your strength sets and do a set of ab work number four is something we can incorporate into our conditioning work and a lot of people now have found the value and finally tapped into the value of carries as a great way of doing conditioning so you can do unweighted unbalanced carries and get a great one to combo here you getting your conditioning effect but at the same time you heavy dose of AB and core stability really that lateral pillar strength because you relative to the other maybe 20 pounds on one side 80 pounds and the other or even higher obviously you can handle it and work on working on your conditioning at the same time that you I work in there reason why you can little tweak to your farmers carries to get that much more bang for your buck when it comes to your abs number three in the next obvious place to go is to make your ab training a little bit more fun and we can do that with explosive ab training generally the explosive AB movements like a medicine ball throw here or like these medicine ball slams side to side these are generally more interactive fun exercises you become more of a participant in them they don feel as boring and mundane as maybe just sitting there and doing crunches so if you can trick yourself into actually having fun which is very easy to do with these explosive exercises incorporating them into your routine for at least even a few extra sets each week shouldn all that hard and it for you to kind of sneak in a little bit more ab work talking about sneaking in some ab work a lot of what we do in the gym can actually be instantly turned into more ab focused training just by changing the positioning of our body in space you see our legs are really really responsible for providing stability and support from below but if we actually take them out of the equation we can get a lot more work done by the next link up in that chain which is our core and our ABS for adding that stability and becoming a lot more involved in what we do so I any overhead work will engage our core because we disturbance up above that requires more stability down below and again if we taken the legs out of it we can actually get that from our core we can do it here just by sitting on the ground with our legs out in front of us and doing our shoulder presses that way as opposed to having to always do them standing you can see my core is much more active this way I doing this as part of my shoulder work but I involved sort of in a way that we never even thought we would and we can even take a little step further than that jump up on a pull-up bar you guys know how I pull-up bar and just hanging in general is a great way to instantly engage the ABS our arms are overhead once again all the work is being done overhead so there core but we can add to it by changing the positioning of our legs in space instead of hooking your feet together and bending your knees back try to just get your legs lifted out in front of you just a little bit that little bit will engage your abs even a little bit more and again not any real added expense to what you were doing in the first place you still training your back but at the same time now you little bit more core to what you doing and finally sort of what we known here for athlean-x it integrated ab training and that we talked about putting the core at the core of everything you do there such thing as a non core exercise here in athlean-x we can get your core to work in every single exercise if you know what you therapist my role here is to make sure that we are letting the core do its job because the core is so responsible for your stability no matter what exercise you examples we could take a cable crossover that incorporate it in such a way we call it a 3d crossover where we get our core actively involved here we get a lot of work for both of our Bleek and the same thing can be said here with shoulder training just by doing a landmine twist we get this first half of the exercise which is very again combining two elements here very explosive and then again working on sort of integrating our ABS with our eventual overhead shoulder press so I can work on combining movements and really that what it trying to train like an athlete you never really move in isolation you combine muscle groups that are meant to work together you let them work together and we have a whole program that does that guys our athlean-x program literally lays out for you step by step day by day exercise by exercise how to get your core back at the core of everything you do because it important for how eventually you will function not necessarily if you have to be an athlete but if you want to look like one you doing it guys if you want to start following a program like that head to athleanx.com and get our athlean-x training system in the meantime if you training as I

KEY Lower Ab Workout Tip - LOWER ABS (At Last!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ula9h4jXN1g	ATHLEAN - X	Are you having a hard problem getting those lower abs to pop? I show you one very key component that you should be including on all your lower ab exercises to make that happen. What If you want to get those lower abs to pop, you have to start thinking about one of the things I my videos before, and that is quality over quantity. especially when it comes to ab training and especially when it comes to lower ab training. The reason why is when you abdominal work, mo most guys will do is try to accomplish again that point A to point B mentality. If they hanging leg raise, they know they got to get from point A to point B. The problem is they muscles. They flexors and most of all they what I feel is the most important activation of all when you lower ab training and that is the transverse abdominis. Now, why do we ignore it? Because it ignore it. Basically, guys, when we get up into a hanging position or any lower ab movement, what you want to do is first contract the transverse abdominis. And for those guys that don that is, it that goes around like your inner weight belt. Okay? It runs this way all the way to your back and around the front. The way to activate it or feel as if you activating it is like if you just stepped into an ice cold pool, right? For us guys, we try to, you know, pull our nuts up, right? I mean, that really what it would be like like that. You what you want to do is feel that contraction in through here. But that just the start because you have to be able to hold that before you execute your rep. So how do we do it on some sort of hanging leg raise? Quality over quantity. We want point A to point B, but you better do it right. So what you want to do is again first activate the transverse. Flatten it out. Pulling in from here. Now execute the rep. Again, I told you that when you do a reverse curl, it what the abs are working on is flexing the spine. So if you that get spinal flexion, curling of the torso, curling of the sacrum up and underneath. So flatten it out. Feel the transverse first. Hold it. Pull up. Curl. Okay. And then down. You want to make that harder, all you have to do is increase the time under tension of the ab movement. For this, we have a whole hell of a lot of options. What it does is it makes you hold that transverse even longer, even harder. So, what can we do is it gets more advanced. Again, if I do it normally, a lot of guys will push out when they do their ab exercise. Push out. You belly look. You want to be able to pull in, pull in, up, turn, and then kick out and then down. Okay? That whole time I held that initial transverse abdominis contraction. So again, contract, pull up, rotate, kick out, back, and down. It makes it hard to speak because the whole time I abs. So one more time again. Set, lift up, turn, kick out, and down. Reset, and down, reset, and down. So guys, first and foremost, do these exercises right. Contract the transverse abdominis. Hold it throughout the duration of whatever rep you your ab exercises and most importantly your lower abs so you don distended look. Secondly, nutrition, nutrition, nutrition. Make sure that you are following a good diet plan. We don like to call it diet cuz we actually eat here at Athletics X, but eat the right foods. use them to fuel your workouts and therefore get you to start stripping away that fat and getting them to show. So again, you could have the best form in the world, but if you them, no one them. So guys, at Athlete X, we focus on all aspects. I don here and tell you do this and you going to get abs. That some guys, even here on YouTube, we tell you that Shortcuts, those kind of things, you know. So, what we do here is we cover the real nitty-gritty. You got to follow a great diet. You got to have the right exercises. We put it all together in Athleten X. You can get that, guys, at athletex.com. In the meantime, start focusing on this muscle first and you going to start to see a lot better results from your ab training. I you guys back here again in just a few days. Make sure you leave a thumbs up below and let me know what you thought. See you later, guys. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]	Success

Beginner Ab Workout Mistake (WE ALL STILL MAKE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMBzuYmLq-8	ATHLEAN - X	what today I want to cover the biggest beginner AB training mistake that even Advanced lifters continue to make and that is the number of reps that we doing or focusing on the number of reps that we see even when people say to me they done a thousand rep ab workouts and they do them every day I at all because the number of reps that you do doesn about how much intensity you brought to that ABW workout as a matter of fact most often unless you Advanced trainee the number of reps the higher they go the lower your intensity is and if you want your abs to show you better start flipping that equation around start focusing more on a high quality contraction of your abs and I promise you with far fewer numbers and far less time spent you better results from your ab training think of it this way if you look at me doing this AB scissor here if you focus solely on on how long you can go and how long your legs can stay off the ground and go what is your legs will get tired you it in your hip flexors but you shouldn have that ever happen to you because if you not on your hip flexors but you shifting that Focus to your abs you intensify the contraction by lifting your trunk up off the ground like I doing here my shoulders are off the ground I crunch I top down now the purpose of the legs is really just to act as a disturbance to my ability to hold this position so that it and shaking of my torso from the bottom up that hold here but it hip flexors and if I do it right and I intensify that contraction in the ABS this exercise becomes a whole hell of a lot harder and who cares if I last only 30 seconds versus maybe being able to do it for 3 minutes the other way the 30 seconds was actually targeted at the muscles were trying to develop and overload is everything so another equivalent is trying to do basically bar or bicep curls with a 5B dumbbell am I doing a curl yes am I executing a movement called a curl yes am I doing anything to develop my biceps no that the same concept here that I just tried to cover with the ABS try to focus on causing enough of an overload by increasing the intensity and forget all about counting your ab reps forget all about how long you showed you last week in 6 minutes I did an ab workout here for you that you can follow along with that will push you to the limits I promise you it will was it damn hard yes it was could I have done it for an hour absolutely not did it get the job done 100% so start focusing Less on numbers time reps everything else just focus more on the quality of your contractions no matter what ab exercise you do so there you go hopefully everyone benefits from this video even those that need maybe just a little refresher every now and then me myself included here to keep us honest and to make sure that we focusing on the things that really matter all right in the meantime time if you found this video helpful let me know below cuz I want to see that all about let me know what you want to see and I you each and every week and also if you want more of those follow along ab workouts if you want to be able to crush your abs a lot faster than maybe you thought you could we have unlimited ab workouts because of our ab workout Shuffle feature that athletex training systems you can get them over at athl x.com all right guys I	Success
6 Pack Ab Exercise - Standing Planks! (AWESOME)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3fDepIp5Gs	ATHLEAN - X	What athletex.com. I want to show you today a much more athletic version of the plank that you can start incorporating if all you have is just a single piece of wood, a broomstick. I got a metal bar right here. You could do with a baseball bat. Just one of these and a band. Okay. If you want to start being more athletic and training more athletically, then you should try to get on your feet as often as you can. Most athletic endeavors occur with us on our feet. And if we could build our core strength and stability in that position, well, now we guys rely so much on groundbased core training. And unless you or a fighter who relies on having to have your strength down low, you going to want to be able to incorporate your core strength and have it carry over to your feet. So, here do. You take whatever bar you to use or whatever broomstick, whatever you the band around an end. Okay? Just like this. Now, we take one end and we just pass it through the other loop. And then we pull on it. So, what that does is it creates a nice anchor to the end of the bar this way. Now, we got to go and hang it up over our pull-up bar. So, we hang it the end through the pull-up bar and then we pass the bar all the way through. Okay? Pass it right through there. Pull down. And now pull down one more time. Now we got it anchored up there perfectly. So now, how do we do this? We call this a standing plank. We know that again, one of the best ways we can train our abs is to try to resist rotation, resist this anterior uh you the sagging here of our low back by having our core be strong. But if we can change it so that we feet, even better. So we unilateral setup here where I push out on the band this way. And now I this force I pull me back in this direction. So even better than a plank, I resisting this anterior posterior motion, but I which is a huge component of our core. So if I get out here and I push, now I can actually do this and hold this just like I would a plank. So the challenge here is to not allow myself to be rotated back here by the band and work on the same way you would a normal plank. try to build up your your uh the time and the endurance that you can hold this. And of course, you just flip it right here to the other side. And I push out with the left arm. And now I the same scenario going on where I resisting rotation this time to the left. Now, if you want to make it a little bit more athletic and dynamic, you can turn this into more of a power exercise by pushing out and then letting yourself eentrically slowly uh coil back. Okay? Push out and then coil back. Same thing here. Push out and then essentially control that recoil. Push and then control the recoil. So, as you can see, guys, if you want to start training like an athlete, then start doing more athletic things in the gym and in your workouts. We that here at Athlete X. I don to sit there and start worrying about concentration curls and leg extensions. Start doing things that you can do that will have more carryover. Even if you not going to be an athlete or have to ever function as one, you want to start looking more athletic, then you got to train like one. And that looking for a complete system and training program that does that for you, head to athletics.com right now and let me share with you the exact step-by-step workouts that I use with my top level pro athletes that we now bring to you. In the meantime, if you found this video helpful and you want to give this a try, leave your comments and thumbs up below. And also, let me know, guys, watch Wednesday.

40 Rep Ab Workout (HARD CORE!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsqVAPKcGZU	ATHLEAN - X	what dcom I got a good one here for you today it you train your core stability different than core strength here simplify it if your spine is moving during any ab exercise you for strength you core stability and if you training enough exercises for stability then you workout today I want to show you really fast with our north south East West workout how you can start to address this in a really effective way so to perform this workout get down on the floor and don this at home you have two options you can actually take a plate put it on a carpeted surface so that it will slide or put it on a towel and slide it across a hardwood surface both of those will likely be a little easier than what I showing you here and that we dragging the iron on the rubber floor but we gauge what you can handle and push yourself to make sure you most out of this so here have a towel under my elbows for good reason because I forearms and elbows to stabilize and prevent rotation of my spine as my arms move and that make sure this spine doesn least try not to let it move that key to core stability so we start out north south I out and then pull it back towards me push it out to arms length and pull it back towards me yeah I little bit of additional shoulder work here which is never a bad thing but more importantly by using my arm to challenge my core that move your arm you stability of your core right we getting asymmetrical so you want to make sure that your core can handle that and not just that be able to overcome and pull that back we north south on the right arm and then we 10 reps north south but that just starts getting interesting because now we go east west and this is a lot more of a challenge to your spinal rotation which is the point of the entire workout put that plate all the way to the left reach into the hole so you have a little bit more leverage here and pull that thing across your body with your right arm and then push it back over to the left each time you pull or push your body wants to follow you don the whole point of this challenge make sure you do not allow movement of the spine or at least resist it as much as you can do 10 reps with the right arm start with the plate over on the right side and do 10 reps with the left arm so there you have it guys a complete ab workout and just 40 reps training that all important core stability remember it and if you want to get complete ABS you got to understand how to do them both and if you things in your training that you just weren right now and get our athletex training system I worked very hard to make sure that I address everything that I felt were the most common things that guys Overlook so you can get way better results in a shorter period of time training with me you can get that over at athletes.com in the meantime if you found this video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know what you want to see on this channel your channel you let me know and I my best to cover what you want to see in the days and weeks ahead all right guys I	Success
OBLIQUES and AB Shredder in 1 exercise!!!!!!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwgIuO0Xz24	ATHLEAN - X	h [Music] H hey guys Jeff Cavalier back in the Xbox out of the kitchen this time to show you uh something I think you guys are really going to like if you look at this is last month Fitness magazine uh that I wrote in um I was interviewed really to about a uh uh something called balls uh appropriately 10 ways to dominate and it talks about uh how to train to build muscle gain speed improve your agility uh everything we talk about here with athlan X and I want to go one step further not just how to perform on the field but really how to perform anywhere uh we going to be pro athletes but you want to be able to have that kind of physique and have that kind of strength to be able to do whatever it is that you like to do so in this article we talk about a lot of key principles being able to stay on your feet cuz I think all athleticism begins on your feet and most of the exercises that I ever try to Advocate you doing are somewhere in some position you tie more muscles together while we do it and we with everything we do if you stand on your feet unilateral training you know trying to work out one leg or the other or work one arm at a time because you want to try to overcome the imbalances that a lot of times what we do in daily life or on the field will establish they establish imbalances we want to try to over them and then everything really about the involvement of the core can you involve the core in virtually everything you do because even if I were to just grabb this thing right here you can see just how it it it engages the muscles over here just to be able to pull that down it body it funnel through it so I and I playoffs a guy who uh I I love his story the fact he adversity and he is just dominating right now Major League Baseball maybe on their way to the World Series and one thing about Josh Hamilton is that he involving huge amounts of core strength with everything he going to hit a baseball you have to be able to load up on your backside and then you have to be able to unload but it all comes to rotation so in wanting to say how can I help you guys to increase your rotational power become stronger become more ripped in the same time at the same time I came up with something I call a double-edge wood Chopper we Chopper you know coming down like this with a double-edged wood Chopper one of the exercises that I use when I train my athletes I load up a cable machine with you know I got four plates on here and four plates on here but I basically set the arms up as if I here one up there one down there I going to grab them both bring them together in front of my body but don clasp your fingers if you clasp your fingers you uh uh the Advan that you have here from not letting these things slip away if you hold your hands here you can see that you working the bicep everything has to work hard so with the double-edged wood Chopper basically we we we chop down come back to the top now as you can see I got this Ecentric or slow control contraction on the way back on this arm but I got to overcome momentum and actually work the Lower Side on the way down I got to eccentrically control this and you can see that this side has to do the same thing and I got to concentrically drive down and use my obliques and my abs to get the top arm down so you it both sides and of course after you work this you would go reverse the arm setup and take it down the other way too so guys if you are already training like an athlete I don to play if you never step on a field in competition if you want to look like one you got to start training like one and these are the kind of principles these are the kind of things like a guy like Josh Hamilton does to get out there and just crush and and become an MVP and you can do the same thing and look like that so if you haven it go over to aex.com right now get a program that weight room but make you more athletic at the same time and certainly give you that RI strong athletic muscle that it seems like most guys want again aex.com we another video thanks again for watching guys I h h [Music]	Success

Home Abs Exercises - FIXED! (Planks and Rollouts)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI-MNJTbf7U	ATHLEAN - X	What A couple weeks back, I showed you how by contracting your adductors, your groin muscles during hanging ab exercises, how you can get a lot more work done for your abs and therefore get better results from your hanging ab exercises because of the stability that that contraction provides and how it actually sets up a stable base for your abs to contract. When it comes to stability ab exercises though, like the plank and like the ab roll out, two of the more popular and beneficial uh exercises for your abs, the same thing applies here too. But you got to learn how to shut off the other muscle. This time it hip flexors. And again, we about how the hip flexors can get too involved in ab exercises, costing you for your abs to actually do the work. So, I right here and show you how to shut them off to better activate the abs. All right. So, first of all, I get into a plank position here. When we normally do planks, we don focus so much on what the hell is going on from here down. We always focus on the abs. We don going on down below. So, you see people do planks in this position all the time. Or maybe they right? And as it gets harder, they even start doing this a little bit more. They while that is ab activation by lifting up, what you you ground, you counterbalance or counterforce your ability to stay in this plank. So, I talked about it in our shoulder video last night, how when you try to push back into a bench as you do a shoulder press, you force away from you so you can get that weight away, you know, away. The same thing happens here. You got your toes digging into the ground. Hip flexors are activated. they ground. Therefore, we know if the hip flexors are activated that the glutes are not and the abs are not doing as much work as they could because the hip flexors are trying to help with that. So, what we can do is squeeze our ass cheeks together here. It makes it a lot easier. Now, not only do we have a stable base from below, but we shutting down the hip flexors. We reciprocally inhibiting the hip flexors from activating by squeezing our ass together. You can have your toes, your heels right next to each other and squeeze your legs together to also activate the adductors like we talked about the last time. Now you that the abs do much more of the work. It doesn to show you the ab roll out. Okay, like I said, next up is the ab roller. And the ab roller is a popular ab exercise and for good reason. Matter of fact, I think it exercises you can do. It challenging. We have a whole workout on this channel if you that you could use this with. But more importantly, it And it the muscles that you may have forgotten about that more effective for your abs. So, this is what we do normally when we do an ab roll out, right? Okay. Watch as I go out here. So, we to the end here and then the first move that they this. Look what are flexing this angle. You can even see it on the my my pants with the the three stripes. The angle of the hips is flexing. Okay. So, if you really want this to work though, even if you don hold it all the way out, the most important time to hold this is when you get out there. So, if you do the ab roll out and you get to the end, now squeeze your glutes there. So, the first move is back with the abs. Okay? Here and here. Here and here. Okay? Everything up. I back. Everything is coming up at once. And of course, as we get to the top, you can do some of that flexion to actually incorporate the abs much more strongly. But the idea is you want to make sure that you doesn don outs. I see people doing it all the time, just counting away at ab reps. It doesn can count to. It only matters how many quality reps you can do. And that you you start incorporating and becoming more aware of some of the muscles that aren supporting the efforts of the abs and helping you to get more out of it. Guys, we have complete ab workouts every day available for you with our athletics training system. I do believe that daily ab work is a great thing, but only if you do it efficiently, shorter periods of time, more effective reps. I put that together for you with our athletics training system.

INTENSE 6 Pack ABS Exercise - Get \"Bulletproof\" Abs (6 Pack Abs)!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzBZmX8Mb7k	ATHLEAN - X	it [Music] hey guys Jeff cavaliere back here aex.com continuing on with the bulletproof series you guys have liked it we what are we talking about how do we develop bulletproof ABS well the first thing that I got to do if I making bulletproof resistant to injury more functional you got to tie in other muscle groups and with the ABS we know right off the bat from that buzz word about the core there ABS than the ABS we have the hips the low back right we want to get all these areas tied in together to work together so one of the best things that I uh tend to use is you got to have rotation too and you have to have your feet grounded right if we want to be functional we got to have our feet on the ground crunches on the ground are okay but when you put yourself up on your feet they become much more Interactive and you to see what I little bit of rotation one little band something to Anchor it to that do get our feet firmly grounded in here two hands on top of the band we to take it down and up and over our head now from here you if I walked out a little bit further this band wants to pull me back there right the only thing that me back to the front is flexing ABS now I could actually turn that into just an exercise on its own it just coming straight down straight in through here straight down I pulling with the hands pulling straight with the core but we even harder we down okay and then just blow it up drop it down control and up what we is on top of getting rotation in through the core we hip that we talked about and we have internal rotation at that hip external rotation of the hip internal and external it post off in that direction now something really interesting happens if we want to take this to the next level and this is what I if we want to get a little bit more intense we got to get off this leg because what this leg is doing is providing a lot of that front side stability so that when I come up into here I leg to hold me so if I can this leg what happens when I take that leg off the ground and I come up now this side is transferred from the ground straight up into here all that stability I was getting with my foot on the ground now has to be handled by the next part up the chain which would be up there here through the outside of the ABS and the obliques so we can try to do it down and up down and up I pinky toe touch or nothing at all this is not easy but when we talking about getting bulletproof D guys you got to take it to the next level so I think the main point of all this in this bulletproof series is are you doing enough in your workouts to create what I would call a bulletproof body and 99 times out of 100 even top level athletes that I get a chance to work with are not doing enough so if you want to do what you need to do then I suggest you follow athlet X this whole program was a 90-day program created to develop what I like to call a bulletproof body bigger muscles No Doubt out less fat no doubt but a body that also is resistant to injury so you can stay in the gym and keep the results coming guys if you haven aex training program over at aex.com I comments rolling let me know what else you want to see in the bulletproof um areas have you suffered an injury yourself tell us about it let talking leave your comments below and oh guys do me a big favor if you like the video and it helps us to show more people and to help more people and show them all what athl x is all about we be back here again in a week more bulletproof body maybe a few other things mixed in too see you guys [Music] n	Success
AB WORKOUT CHEAT SHEET (Which Ab Exercises and When to do Them!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KmkN_Fzoqc	ATHLEAN - X	one of the biggest questions when it comes to training your abs is not necessarily what exercises to do but when you should train them we to cover that today and of course I even show you a few [Music] exercises what aex.com AB training in particular when is the right time to train the ABS we not talking about just the exercises here but when should you be doing the exercises and to me there is a difference we basically have three options before the workout after your workout or my preference at a whole different time during the day carving out an AB time each day now why and how can we do that we can do that because I yeah I want it five to six times a week but I only want you to have to dedicate 5 to 10 minutes in that AB session now you know at aex we talk about this six-pack progression and how we should be attacking the ABS lower uh lower up bottom up rotation obliques mid-range and I do that in a second but when you do those it it on your abs and then by doing them at a separate time during the day you to focus because I find that if we take the scenario of doing it before our workout let we kind of not really uh giving I think the focus we need to to our ABS in that pre-workout time we anxiously waiting to get to our legs so we can get our workout done and get out same scenario after the workout you just left it all on the floor if you doing athlan X you workout 40 minute workout and done a great job at high intensity how much should you really have left to start doing extra ab work at the end the answer would be not very much um if you what a contribution hip flexors play in AB training and we don do that with fatigued legs and hip flexors so you try to take that approach so try to carve out a time during the day that you can do this separately and keep it consistent now my favorite time right before dinner why because I know I going to eat dinner every night there not a night that goes by that I try not to eat dinner so if I keep that in mind and Link it to my ab training I ab workout right before I eat dinner and then go from there and I know that I not going to miss now all this being said guys if you can dinner or if you can separate time then do it before the workout or after the workout because if the alternative is not doing it at all I don you tone to be able to see your abs that necessary all right so with that being said let routines exactly like I talked about to give you that strategic approach athl next [Music] stop [Music] [Music] he [Music] so there you have it another athletex style ab workout that you can add to your Arsenal and most importantly see two things again take this and put it where it works best for you I have my time I carve it out see a time that works for you where you consistent with it and secondly remember notice the way we attack the ABS this is not just about choosing any exercises and then randomly hoping that they produce results you want to attack your abs in a in a certain way again following a specific order if possible to Target your abs and get them to respond best when your lower abs are fatigued you still want to be able to have your your upper abs functioning and it gets a lot easier to do that if you approach them in the right sequence if you haven athleen x.com grab the 90-day training program get a plan you know have this as your plan as your guideline to show you exactly how to attack not just your abs but every single muscle group in your body so that the end result being you get a lot more athletic looking you get a lot more functional and overall you start to look and feel a lot better I see you guys over at athletes.com in the meantime make sure you leave your comment below let me know what time are you training your abs and what results you switched that up and also let me know if you like these videos I them like you know guys two times a week so anything you want to see make sure you leave it down below I guys [Music] [Music] soon	Success
How to Get a 6 Pack (WITHOUT \"Ab Exercises\")	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aImW4d9BnaQ	ATHLEAN - X	are you training your abs enough well even if you told me you did them seven days a week my answer to you would be no let me explain in today [Music] video what athleanx.com AB training how much is too much well if you videos here on our Channel you know I gone on record to say that I believe five six and even seven times a week AB training is great why because these resilient postural muscles are built for that these guys are ready to take on the work and the more frequent the work the better now that goes contrary to pretty much everything else I believe when it comes to training we have a very specific dose that muscles can handle that beyond that we wind up overtraining and causing damage the ABS because of their ever constant firing throughout the day these muscles are different and built for more volume that said is that all you need need to do right five six seven days a week no of course you obviously need to have your nutrition in place because even the the the best app program with the shittiest diet leaves you with the shittiest ABS okay there just no way around it but there than that we talk about direct AB training and then indirect AB training and for anybody that athl X you should know all about the core being at the core of every single exercise we do so what I wanted today to do was to show you what about AB can we have a workout where we highly Target the ABS and work them on every single thing we directly training them so let me go and break down muscle Group by muscle group an example exercise that highly integrate the ABS without us feeling as if we directly you add those two together indirect and and in direct AB training you combo okay so let top chest right we take a single arm dumbbell bench press as you can see when I demonstrate this exercise if I have a dumbbell in one single hand and I lower it down to that side obviously 60 70 80 lbs that Direction so there my core to pull myself back keep my trunk from rotating in the same direction that dumbbell is dropping if you want to make this extra challenging you want to make it a little less of a chest exercise then lift the leg on the same side of the dumbbell and that going to make it even harder for you to resist the rotation next we look at back right the king of all back exercises the pull-ups but as you see with this one slight modification of the exercise that I doing here the knees come up we get a tremendous amount of core activity matter of fact we stress the lower abs which is even better because these are even harder for us guys to Target now how do I know this because as you guys might remember if you me for any length of time having a hernia surgery I went through and tried to do my recovery and speed it up as fast as possible I was down on the ground doing crunches literally 3 days later but for 3 weeks I couldn suspend myself off of a pull-up bar why because it core exercises the soon as soon as you lift your feet off the ground while hanging from a bar you already ignite those abs so yet another way just by pulling your knees up to really engage Ys at the same time you old classic killer back exercise going next one I demonst right here is for the shoulders our seated long leg press we all know pressing overhead tough activity even harder when we ground right and on our butts because when we get our legs out in front of us we leverage that we once have with our legs underneath us now normally guys I want you on your feet for every exercise that you do because that however in this case we different Target here we work the shoulder ERS take away any momentum force them to do a lot of work but at the same time because our trunk has to stay upright as you see me fighting here to keep myself upright that work overtime moving on to the biceps our incline variable curls now look at me do here what looks like a regular incline dumbbell curl but wait what come up I actually am changing the angle of where Peak contraction occurs right in an incline curl heak contraction occurs down here in the 45° uh range of motion however as I sit up not only am I shifting that Focus to the end range a little bit more to get a little bit more Peak contraction but as you can see the ABS are working as well so a nice way to integrate ABS again without even thinking about it into a standard classic effective bicep exercise you guys know I love this one the body weight tricep extension this is a classic exercise that basically our way to take the great nose breaker skull crusher type exercise and turn it into something we can do anywhere with just our body you can do it on the back of a couch but as you can see this is sort of an elaborate plank exercise right besides what we up at the arms you can see that the plank is established through the rest of the body you you got a tough tricep exercise with of course a heavy dose of core finally we wrap it all up with our leg exercise and overhead dumbbell lunge now before you start thinking I know the lunge great exercise but how we your sides and put them up over your head thoratic extension is demanded in order for you to do this exercise and along with that heavy core stabilization as you can see as I exercise I the weight because it different feeling and a completely different challenge for our bodies than what we having the those dumbbells held at our side but yet again you can see core at the core of everything we do whether it be direct or indirect work so there you go how much core training is too much well if you work guys not enough right as we see core work needs to be done more right we need to be able to in integrate direct and indirect work and it doesn matter even if you sixpack ab app our six-pack promise plus you combination of the two you need to start integrating into everything you do this is exactly what athletex training is all about if you haven over to athlet next.com and grab our 90-day training program remember I said even the best ab training workout direct and indirect is not going to do anything for

The Weirdest Ab Exercise Ever (THAT WORKS!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P9dJbMRKgo	ATHLEAN - X	what you ready to do the weirdest ab exercise you probably ever have well I tell you this it may look weird but it actually going to help you a lot and of course we wouldn exercise if I didn case now let me start off by describing why this is weird well all you to have to do is look at it you to know it ever ever going to want to do this in the gym and that understand because I wouldn you might even want to stay away from your girlfriend or your wife or whoever might be watching cuz you might want to maintain a little bit of um Integrity but I will tell you this if you want to develop a complete core you have to start mastering the skill that required to complete this exercise and that talking about spontaneous contraction and if we we want to look more athletic you got to make sure that you can have the ability to control a contraction a moment notice so let these examples here okay first off this is what we call rolling like a ball and this is a Pilates Type move and again maybe your wife has even been doing this or your girlfriend long before you what actually fun a lot of guys that hate core workor are probably going to be stopping this video at some point getting out on the on the floor because they have to try this and that bad thing if we can get anybody to try and exercise we here now you do is establish my my feet off the floor and keep them there the whole time I want to hug my knees into my chest keep those legs off the floor and just simply hollow out my body by creating a posterior tilt and then rolling back now as I come to the top all of my momentum wants to take my feet forward they want my feet to touch the floor right we want to complete that movement but guess what that our abs are going to contract spontaneously to prevent that forward momentum and they so at a moment we you see I keep trying to fight that you I go wrong either I can way up because I enough momentum on my roll back or I do it wrong by allowing momentum to control my body and not let my control uh my core control the momentum and my feet wind up hitting the floor but we always have ways that we can we can progress and regress things here and if we want to progress this to make it even more difficult we move on to this next variation that we call a hollow Rock and now for a hollow Rock you extend your legs out in front of you you uh overhead so now you weight to control especially with the legs that far out now you much more weight of your legs to prevent from hitting the ground and the move is very much the same you rock back and then you rock forward you got to put on the brakes and those brakes are going to be put on courtesy of your core now we can make it even goofier but effective by moving on to another Pates Type move here called the seal and this really is a stupid looking exercise guys don me wrong like I said do this in the privacy of your own home if you want to maintain your your integrity but it will help you you grab on the inside of each leg and around each ankle and once you are going to be obviously uh spread apart here you want to clap your heels together when you come to the top in a seal-like movement I guess that the movement got his name from when you get to the top the demand of clapping your heels maintain or ensures that you your core strength and control not because you got lucky cuz you to have to hang out there now for a couple seconds and establish that you not going to let that momentum take your feet down you can stay there so long that you can even clap your feet and that fun try it you how many times in a row you can do this most people can row without at least not getting up to the top or or having their feet touch the ground so you clap your feet at the top you roll back you clap your feet at the top again the last variation of this makes it even more difficult now you got to clap your feet at the bottom of the movement so when you roll back and then you got to clap your feet again at the end of the movement so you establishing core control at the end of the day guys that about if you can get more core control you that you can generate from the ground up no matter what movement you perform or no matter what athletic skill you perform because you your entire Mass controlled everything will go and flow through the core and if we can very impaired athletically and you just won if you want to have the most strong athletic rip core and that is all about so guys try this out I promise I won at you doing this but you got to try I telling you it too if you guys on how to develop that complete core if you want a complete training program to help you do that head to athlet x.com right

Ab Workout Booster (MAKE YOUR ABS WORK HARDER INSTANTLY!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhScFOaEeN8	ATHLEAN - X	What Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.COM. You want to know how to make any ab exercise\\nharder and therefore more effective in the long run? You abdominis when you I want to show you today exactly how to do\\nthat, and show you a couple new ab exercises that you can apply it to where you can really\\nfeel the difference. First and foremost, what is the difference\\nin the 2 muscle groups? The transverse abdominis is the one that runs\\nright to left. It runs around your waist and it will act\\nlike your own internal weight belt, ok. So, especially when you it the band, it That easier if we get on our feet. Secondly, it So, how are we making sure that we I Most don So, you turn to the side, the muscles in the\\ntransverse abdominis are not all that sexy. They if you And we all sometimes can even be lean enough. I abdominis, but you could if you train it. So, what I try to do in every one of my ab\\nexercises is first and foremost contract the transverse abdominis. Right there I was able to flatten my stomach\\nby basically pulling my belly button in towards my spine, ok. It cinching down the waist. You can visualize it. So again, here I am relaxed. Here I am with the transverse abdominis contracted. You can also see that when I do that, that\\nsort of V cut area becomes a little bit more visible and that With that held in place, that You don You contract the transverse first. Grab here, and now we twist towards the center. Holding it on every rep where I normally could\\nprobably get, you know, 30 of these. I might only be able to get 10 perfectly executed\\nwith the transverse engaged. Ok. That You If I worry about it and I contract and I hold\\nand now I try to do it, it Now, what The next step is, you want to get into the\\nposition already. So here, and then contract and then take a\\nstep to the right, my right here. Step. Step. Back. And back. Step. Step. Back. And back. I can hardly even talk, whew. Step. Step. Ok. And now it Whew. Whew. Again, a lot easier if I hold it here and\\nI step and I step. I step, and I step. But you can see the difference down here. Even the twisting of the abs. I I don I want to hold it, and hold it straight ahead. That means the transverse is going to have\\nto hold me there. It doesn Look, as I contract the transverse abdominis and then\\nperform the Reverse Curl. I can do it in a Bicycle Crunch. First, contract the transverse abdominis and\\nthen perform the right and left rotational movement. It applies to every exercise you do with your\\nabs. Hanging Ab Raises, the same thing. Contract and then pull up. It makes a hell of a difference. It time will accumulate into a much better result. Guys, if you feel you might be overlooking\\nthis in your training, don you There how you train, if you start to train like\\nan athlete, you that you can improve. There of a lot of time. You start right there. This quick little fix takes about 2 seconds\\nto get into that position, and it takes a lot more hard work to maintain it. These are the kinds of things we teach in\\nour ATHLEANX Training System. It In the meantime, if you found this tip helpful,\\nmake sure you leave your thumb comments below.

Most Versatile Ab Exercise Ever! (6 PACK ABS)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeJ5Xc_7qEI	ATHLEAN - X	What athletex.com. Today I you the most versatile ab exercise that you can do. And guess what? We to take it from Pilates. And before you start thinking that it is not something that you macho six-pack, trust me, guys, the principles behind Pilates and the principles behind this specific exercise are so versatile, they into any ab program. Matter of fact, they should be in your ab program if you want to develop complete abs. The exercise is the rollup, and I demonstrating it here. I over so many of the components that are so good about this. First of all, we looking for elongation. We getting a little bit of decompression of the spine just in the starting position. I as I can over my head. Given I have my labor issue that makes my right arm hang a little bit higher than the other. But the idea is the intent is there. The feet are also pointing and lengthening. My quads are lengthening as far as I can. I and decompression in the spine. I sit up and I initiate as I always tell you to do. We had a whole video about this before. As you exhale, draw in the stomach. Do not blow out the stomach as you as you come up. Draw in the stomach as you exhale. And I initiate and I come up. And now the cool thing about this exercise is if you try it, I guarantee you, I don the first one, you will get further on the second rep, you the third rep. Each rep you will improve and increase your flexibility where you flexibility in your low back and in your hamstrings predominantly in your low back. But sit tight. I you how you can change that to actually include the hamstrings a little bit more as well. So now when I come up and I reach towards my toes as I come back down the next thing we abs. We obviously are trying to slow the descent of our upper body back down to the floor. And we segmentation. Another benefit as I try to literally paint myself one vertebrae at a time starting from my low back and working up one vertebrae at a time trying to make contact with the ground so I have that control of the abs at the same time that I segmentation here through the spine. So we have all these components working but I said if you wanted to try to get more out of your hamstrings here then you have to do another very important thing that we is change the position of your pelvis. If your pelvis is in a posterior tilt, as it will be during this exercise, then you you You stretching out your low back, which again is not a bad thing, but it going to help your hamstrings. So, when you get to the top, make this one little switch. Come to the top and then try to get into an anterior tilt. Try to tilt your pelvis this way forward as if you your of your hipbones. And that will get you an anterior tilt. And you immediately feel the hamstring stretch kick in a lot more. You going to back off a little bit on how far your hands can get because you limited by your hamstrings. Hang there for a second or two, get a little bit of a stretch on there, go back into the posterior tilt, and then complete the rep as you would. As I said, one of the most versatile ab exercises because you You together. And a matter of fact, you training them the way they prefer to work together. Remember, your body is not some isolated ab exercise performing machine. It does a whole hell of a lot more than that if you let it. If you head to athletics.com and get our Athletics training system, I show you how to train your body like an athlete. We talk about it all the time, how to start incorporating exercises that make your body move the way it should and because of that get you far better results by training that way.

got to go high carb diet low carb diet no fat high fat all this stuff guys it not that hard it really isn there to follow start implementing them this week and I to help you strip off the fat so you can start to see these abs that you creating underneath okay first thing is water drink a lot of water throughout the day there substitute you can drink coffee and people drink milk and people but it not the same is water this little Poland Spring bottle here is I believe it O or so or you know 15 o a trick that someone told me a while ago that I I you know I use now I don much but in the beginning I did was to put a couple rubber bands around the bottle you drink the bottle let say take you put four if it pull rber rubber band off fill it up again and drink it again when you empty it again take another rubber band off fill it up again it many bottles you drink throughout the day or otherwise you track so make sure you probably between 80 and 100 ounces for most of you guys second thing is let go back to the whole issue about cardio forget it guys I not need cardio to strip off the fat you don training if you haven out the athletex work workouts we have total body workouts upper body lower body core everything we possibly could need we have them there go go to athl x.com right over here and click on them and get those workouts but for the core the last thing is Diet guys don confused with all this high carb no carb low carb stuff it are very important let you limit your fats pick out the foods that have a lot of fat in it your sweets your chocolates your Butters your your cream sauces your mayos your anything that has a lot of fat in it let out this week let diet just replace it with different different condiments if you if you putting it on a sandwich or you know put some ketchup put mustard put salsa put you know lowfat uh salad dressings any of that stuff make your substitutions take your whole milks out use nonfat milk you thankful that you did when you do it guys you calories off nine calories per gram of fat versus four for carbohydrate or protein it those fats out let to introduce five new exercises I want you to do every day this week remember ABS can be trained every single day you start with these next five exercises and will carry us through to there will be a show this Saturday where I going to feel some questions because I getting a lot of questions from you guys out there and I appreciate it I to feel some of those questions and we let the first exercise this week on the second week of wasbo Wednesday is something I call the iso reverse crunch but with the typical reverse crunch what most people do is you see them come here and then they swing their legs up like that we kind of did that heels to the heavens last week it but you have to do it with strict form you don to use your lower body your lower stomach what we do with the iso reverse crunch is actually pin our heels to our butt okay we don of momentum from our legs extending here so keep your heels up against your butt as much as you can if you have tight quads it will be a little bit more difficult but from here your hands down at your side and simply lift your butt up from there just trying to get your butt off the ground right up from your tailbone the next exercise is one called one down two up it of what we did last week the heels to the heavens and again what I just said was you want to make sure that you not using momentum to move your you know to move your body here you abdominal strength core strength and move your body it going to get real results but with the variation is instead of having right here we have a one down which means one leg is going to come down obviously this is going to require my stomach to brace even a little bit more then I bring it back up and then two up all right two up then I go to the other side one down bring it up up press two up so one down two up I doing crunches at the gym what we want to do is a do them right and B use a medicine ball to enforce that we do them right when we get back into our crunch position which is exercise number three here this week you themselves in this position here which is correct they crunches and as they get tired you start to see those legs drop more and more and more it gets harder for the lower body and core to hold your legs out the weight of your leg starts to make it more difficult as you fatigue well let do that right and now let harder by putting the med ball out on the ends of our feet right there and balancing it now you can either keep your hands behind your head here for more more challenge CU more weight to lift or cross them across your chest here and let your knees head toward your elbows head towards your knees don you got to start over from one all right guys time to step up a difficulty a little bit here in week two this is called the Commando or downhill crunch take an ordinary bench take a chair take a stair in your house anywhere where you can put yourself on a decline you going to come out like this and put your feet up on the stair or elevated platform stabilize your upper body here keep your elbows almost locked out now basically you right knee cross it across your body towards your left hand crunch up actually try to squeeze your abdominals in here really works the obliques in a real challenging way all right guys let episode of watch board Wednesday with one that I like to call the standing tubing over twist you standing tubing twist before where you take the band you rotating back and forth that does work the core and definitely an important way everything is not about just crunching your core controls and produces rotation so let twist it up a little bit no pun intended let that Center position so I working because this is the relaxed starting position right here let engage the ABS get it to the starting position here right in in in the center of my chest now let now my exercise is decelerate it control it back to Center there tension right here trying to pull me that way and let so I position to the neutral position but never to the relaxed position which is different than a normal standing tubing exercise let control all right guys so that the second edition of wasbo Wednesday here on the athletex show guys it really simple I our journey in 12 weeks to get you six-pack abs what do we need today again we stay confined to our Xbox which is great for me I love it here but we don need much space number one number two we just need our bodies we have a medicine ball we

Killer Oblique Exercise - Get Shredded Obliques!!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir5_zkjpx00	ATHLEAN - X	with Thanksgiving day just around the corner here in the United States you may be thinking about ways that you to carve up the turkey well I about ways I out those abs and going show you today how we can do it by focusing on the obliques [Music] what athleanx.com as you know here in the states Thanksgiving Day holiday coming up in a few days and you might be thinking about what you eating and that worry about what you doing to you offset that as well with the way you work out and train now I said one of the areas that we to focus on and obsess about as we get through the holiday season are the six-pack abs because most guys tend to let that go they figure we that on January 1st and try to get them back I think if you have the right training approach you don that and one of the ways we can help the ABS to show is by Framing them anatomically we set up with some good advantages to frame our abs and that with the obliques because they face down and in and we could actually help to again make a picture and sort of frame the ABS and make and actually trim your waist you know give the the uh impression of a trimmer waistline so I have one great exercise that I think you should try and do all I do is hang one of the aine resistance bands here up to a pull-up bar so I don of tubing you handled tubing you could double It Up and Hold on both handles with one hand or tie it up and then hook it around your forearm right above the area of your bicep here you around your forearm and then take a step away now what you want to do is again look at the direction that the obliques run they basically they run down and in so in order to activate a muscle you usually want to stretch it or put it in an elongated position first because then you have the advantage of being able to contract it more forcefully so what we do here is we turn a little bit away from the direction of the band so the band little bit away that creates a stretch here and then we down you know turn and go down so we come down you can see just that move right there we can fire the obliques so it rotation I arm is staying here I rotating and pulling down through here through my torso so obviously you want to do that on both sides but the idea here is guys that you want to be able to help frame the ABS by giving some work and direct work to the obliques now as I said you might have dreams of eating everything you that in sight come next week but we all know that abs are made behind the plate as well as down here in the gym it onew combo and getting rid of the fat that sits over it is extremely important if you head over to aex.com right now and get our 90day training program if you haven haven including for the next few or few weeks the ri for the holidays bonus we going to tell you how to sort of strategically eat around the holidays to help yourself and give yourself a better chance in case you are one of those guys that is going to overeat on Thursday okay so we strategy in going forward into the month of December as we have a bunch of holidays coming up there too but the idea here is guys you got to train the right way you got to activate muscles the right way pre-stretch gy put all the science back in strength get the best results and I promise you we with athlex meantime for all you that will be celebrating next week Happy Thanksgiving and we Friday with the Black Friday workout coming back again for our second year in a row till then I I [Music] [Music] n for	Success
Core Exercise Combo (2 MOVES TO A BALANCED CORE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tvJPnp6x40	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com today is another washboard Wednesday video and of course we going to attack the core here but we have to see how are you going to Define core if you think that it abs you disappointed or at least you might be until you actually try what I show you here today because this might be exactly what you need if you always think about the core in terms of just your abs you see we back in time here think about maybe when when you were a kid when you out in the snow and you made those snow angels right just up and down legs in and out arms up and over your head and an arc we we course it know and should expect by now become more of a devil when you see how we perform this exercise from the other side you see when we want to define the core we including all of the muscles that surround our entire torso and again like I said surround that side and most of the time our posterior chain muscles are not nearly as strong as our anterior your chain and you going to find that out firsthand when you try this so here I am demonstrating the classic snow angel movement except I I do this you can see that obviously I working all the muscles on the front side of my body and in order to do this and maintain my stability while I do it I strength anterior shoulder strength AB strength even quad strength to keep my legs up off the ground it together but guess what you should be strong in these movements in these muscles because you lot of these interior chain dominant exercises where the real fun comes in is when you try to turn over and see if you can do the same thing and I can pretty much guarantee you whatever weight you are using and managing on the front side you if not more and sometimes guys have to even cut it down to nothing some of my top athletes literally can weight but what exposing a major problem in terms of the balance between frontside and backside strength and when we talk about the core we have to have a good balance of strength here between our front side and our back side because our core does continue to wrap around our body as I said in three dimensions it doesn right here at our sides or end where it goes out of sight so I flip over to my stomach and now I have to do this prone version of this exercise and it becomes way the hell harder this is where guys start calling this the angel of death because you 5 lb dumbbells from the 10 I was originally using and as I bring my arm up over my head I obviously have to have full mobility in my shoulder and also through my shoulder blade but the stability to allow me to do this without my arm sinking back down to the ground under the weight of the dumbbells and when I come back down towards my sides I position down to an internally rotated shoulder but most importantly here as you do this when you my glutes and low back have to fire extremely hard to be able to keep my legs off of the ground and also keep my upper body stabilized from sinking as the weights come down towards my lower body so there fact is you want to make sure that you can handle at least half of the weight that you can handle on the front side and if you can you thinking about the core and a lot more narrow sense than you should be you might even be thinking to yourself what is the big deal what working on these smaller muscles I can tell you even as you look at the movement I just showed you there glutes lumbar spine thoracic spinal Erectors all these muscles are going to be extremely important and guess what those big lifts like the deadlift like a bent row all these exercises matter every everything matters when you train like an athlete and if you don have the proper balance or attention paid to some of the smaller muscles it going to become the weakest length that will derail your performance in the bigger exercises the one that you rely on to help you build muscle bigger faster stronger so we have to make sure that we take care of everything here and that are looking for a program that leaves no link in the chain unnoticed then head to athletex get our athletex training system and you train like an athlete to make sure that you right guys I a few days if you found this video helpful make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below and give it a try let me know what is the imbalance you any weight at all that always improve your strength I you guys back here soon	Success

V-Cut RIPPED Abs and BIG Biceps - One Killer Exercise (abs and biceps)!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7zIneoRv_Q	ATHLEAN - X	ABS biceps and obliques who have thought you can combine them all into one exercise but today with maximum muscle interaction from athlean X I show you exactly how to do just that what aex.com as I said in the intro right we have our biceps here obliques and abs and normally we reserve them to train them independently but with maximum muscle interaction which is a principle of applean X I want to show you that yes you can combine all of those into one exercise now what does that do especially here as we hit the New Year it helps you to get faster workouts in because we groups that prefer to work together and by doing that we those muscles by working together to produce more efficient and effective outcomes so stronger muscle actions right you um and the ability of those muscles to work together allows you to function better and then again because we can work quicker for even the guys that are just starting or trying to get over the hump here in the beginning of the new year it get yourself going right that motivation or that little kick in the ass like I said to get yourself at least started because the the thing that stops most people is the start so we want to get you started so I have something I want to show you today here which is an example of Maximum muscle interaction at play and it Constructor now it acronym that stands for biceps obliques and abs and it series that we can do and all you need is a pull-up bar so obviously this is not a traditional pull-up bar but wherever you can hang from something I gave you the limb last week the tree Lim go back out in your yard and use that if you have to but basically what we going to do is again combine a chin up with some ABW now we all know that the chin up is a great bicep exercise a matter of fact I have a variation of that we use in aex where we show how it could be a tremendous bicep exercise even more so than back depending upon how you lift and how you activate your arm but for this one here we do a basic chin up and then at the top we moves to incorporate it so basically the three parts of it are you come up into a chin up and pull your knees up now the point here is not just lifting with your knees cuz that mostly a hip flexor dominated movement we flexors what we work the ab so you want to get some flexion of the spine now we can assure that by having our feet the the soles of our feet visible towards the camera for you now so basically the difference would be if I came up and just lifted my knees here that dominated if I want to get my spine flexed which is one of the functions of the ABS then I want to be able to show my feet to you guys okay so as I curl and pull myself up show the feet then come down twist the feet and then come down twist the feet okay so the three components every time with a pullup up show the feet up show them and twist them up show them and twist them as you get into a rhythm you can probably start cranking out some of the Reps so it looks like this one two 3 one two 3 one two 3 one 2 three one two three one two oh man so that much you can do but I can tell you right now the ABS are activated obliques activated biceps on fire everything working together even part of because I was talking my way through it but just going through there even a bit of a cardio because it of energy to do a full body weight movement like that and incorporate all those muscles together so as you see guys if you start to work with this maximum muscle interaction principle you together that prefer to which allow you to shorten your workouts okay no need to work out for an hour guys I promise you that if you no need to work out long and not only that but by working together you going to start to produce results and see results faster than you normally would because you do the things that they prefer to do in the first place right we by function and the point here is to let them start functioning together guys if you aren of a better time than now to join team after start to see what you can become in 2013 By training like an athlete I invite you on team athleen to come part of our team and be our next success story if you haven now you the program today and get started meantime I your comment down below let me know if you try the B Constructor and how it feels and works for you meantime I see you guys back here in 7 days he	Success
\"ELASTIC\" Legs and Core Workout - Resistance Band Workout	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBSkbfY5pqs	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] Heat up here. [Music] Hey guys, Jeff Cavalere from athletex.com and you might not recognize this uh little mini giant next to me, but uh his name is Neil Bruner and he coming all the way from Saratoga, California. Y right. And uh he for Athleen X Live. Uh yet another guy coming into the Xbox to uh spend a day with me, have his whole program broken down. Now, you know, Neil is a pitcher, um, a high school pitcher, 16 years old, and he really good natural talent and physical abilities, but he develop some spec, you know, specific, uh, protocols and programs where he can really address, get generate more lower body power so he can throw the ball harder. and we few things, but what we decided to do is put together um a cool lower body core circuit utilizing just which you probably seen before this great little uh band, which I think is phenomenal. And you things you can do. You arm pull-ups, one arm push-ups using this band. We explosive today with the lower body, showing you some things that you can overcome the force of the band, try it out, alternate legs, whatever. If you go this side, you right leg. If you go this side and you go your left leg here, you can pick whatever leg you want. Okay, drive out. Get it quick. Come up. Regain your balance and go. Put it back down. All right. Ready? We ball. Put it back down. Good. Center. Get that one a little far further away. Right here. This side. Come on. Drive it out back there. There you go. Back here. Right side for me center. Get out there. There you go. This side over here. Come on. Green ball. This ball. Last one to the [Applause] center. Cool. All right. Now, stay in the band. Just turn and face the camera that way. Right in here. Okay. Now, we This is lateral band squat. Again, what we come out, get the resistance of the band. It this way. So, you got to drive off of this back hip. Get yourself regular squat. Don Your core is going to be firing up on this side. So, you working in this kind of a pattern, but a regular squat. So, take these dumbbells. Very little rest in between here. Try to go as fast as you can. Come straight down. Up. There you go. immediately. Where do you feel it? You feel it firing through here? Yeah. Right through that right hip. All right. So, he from here and he here. So, we that kind of firing going on. Give me uh you got 15 of you. Oh, yeah. Okay, let I hope you Now, let Let work this in too in case they want to do it. Let squats. All right. Right leg is going to be easier to post up on. So, let right leg squat. Give me three on that right leg. So, right there on the right leg, left leg in the air. You see how hard that gets? Now, you can go in a little bit. If you need a little less tension, just go in. Okay. Now, come down there. Straight down and up. You guys know how I like the one leg squat. Come down and up. Good. One more. Now the real hard one. Get on your left leg. You might need to creep in a little bit more. From here, just get a little tension and try to lean out over that side. There you go. Good. Two more. One more. Good. All right. So, I kind of made it a little harder for you. You could split that up. Five, five, and five. Five with two legs. Five on the right. on the left. Now, keep that thing. Take that thing off your body. You to hold it way up over your head. So, these are overhead marches. Legs are going to be out. Try to get out. Get a little bit of a lean forward, but mostly stay vertical. And then I want you to march your legs out. Again, you to have to really work your core and hold yourself down. Okay. So, right from here, this thing wants to snap you backwards, right? So, you got to engage all these muscles in here. Now, when I go on one leg, there you go. That moment that you upright, but you job. Before we did this workout, I think Neil negotiated with me. He said he going to do 15 on each leg. So, I sure if he at this point or not, but that said. So, 15 is what you got to do. Try this one at home if you haven already, guys. As soon as you take that leg off the ground, your core fires up. I I don I say, keep it up. You sure you all the way from California to do that? Oh, yeah. All right. What do we got? 14. All right. Good. Now, last one. We going to elevate this band a little bit. Remember, no resting time in here as as little as we can. So, we to loosen this up a little bit. Climb it all the way up to the top here like that. And then lock it in. Now, what I want you to do here, wood chopper crunch. Get both hands on top. Lead with this elbow. This is good. is going to have a nice carryover for him as a pitcher. Leave with the elbow. As soon as he gets to the front here by rotating now, he towards the front knee. Come up right like that. So, a little bit of power here. And my MMA guys out there will notice that this is a, you know, very similar movement almost to a throw. Same type of thing. Get yourself there. Let the elbow lead with you and then drive it both down and come right out of it nice and explosive. Let right over quickly to the other side and get 12 over there. That That if there are watching, the amount of drive and rotation he through, but I don play any sports, if you trying to get a a better body, better physique, better core, um, all these exercises are great and are going to help. Cool. Do you think you you could ever do core exercises without, you know, being on the ground? Yeah. So, anyway, guys, that take that. I would let him rest a minute and then go through there coming off your forehead. And let him go through that again three to five times total. So, maybe two times more, three times more, something like that. Uh, anything you got to say to anybody out there that those bands in. It than using any just regular free weights or whatever you What we guys, is we bit of force. So, everything just moving straight up and down, usually like this or straight up and, you know, front and back. But if you add the band to it, now you have to stabilize this way, too. So, you can take any exercise that we have, even if it band on us, and that that way. So, we can even be on one leg, whatever it is. So, basically, guys, again, bringing you some unique uses of the band, unique workouts, everything unique here at Athlete X. I thank Neil for coming by all the way from California and I appreciate it. And uh guys, if you want to be the next guy to be here standing with me and doing something like this.

Ab Exercise You've NEVER EVER SEEN (6 Pack Pendulums!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1hTEMtvltw	ATHLEAN - X	does core work mean more work for you not necessarily in fact you can keep your core work very short if you doing the right [Music] exercises what aex.com core work does not have to equal more work why because if you can start training your core and your abs smarter you for as long so what do I mean by that well you guys have probably heard me talk about before some of the major things we have to make sure we when we them I wanted to cover today so I could lead into a really brand new cool killer exercise for you that you can start doing the fact of the matter is the way the core functions we have to have two things we got to make sure that we have a control of rotation or even a prevention of rotation I what I mean by that you guys know that you probably heard the ABS help prevent or or cause rotation you turn your body and your torso by Contracting your abs but they also for me more importantly control Andor prevent rotation so you seen me do this sort of chest exercise before but let part out of it and sort of focus instead on the ABS when I come here if I don control and contract hard through here everything twists you can just see it kind of lets go all right but if I here and I want to let this thing go back slow okay or if I just want to keep it here my abs really have to fire to hold that there so we know clearly that prevention of rotation is key second thing rotation in what direction you just saw me rotating from the top with a fixed lower body here okay but we can also look at it in a different way what if the top stayed and the bottom was rotating so that brings me to the exercise something I playing around with we want to have a challenge to our core you guys know about planks great exercise because it it causes a lot of stability reaction throughout the trunk to engage the ABS but what if we had a way to disturb that try to cause rotation that we would have to prevent well that with this move where we use just a plate and a band and all we one of the athlan elastics extreme bands wrap it through a plate however much you can handle 25 35 45 wrap it through and then just tie it to Itself by you know passing it through so what we created this contraption here now you want to get in between two suspended benches so anywhere that you can support yourself between two benches you going to step through right here with both feet in and then in then you bring it up here around your hips okay so watch that rebound guys it could be deadly so now you got the the weight suspended here you yourself into a plank position now the hell is this weight doing hanging down here well you want to get it moving side to side side to side to side to side now just like that people are going to see that could be a huge challenge for them why it are not just working in a plank but they rotation left and right left and right so becomes a much harder exercise what can I do to make this even more difficult I can raise one arm up and try to do the same thing okay and same thing here letting it go side to side with one arm up gets really tough and again you can even turn into the side plank here you can hardly see but in here and hold and let it turn now I got side plank oblique activation with the challenge of The Swinging pendulum plank guys definitely not an easy exercise but something H take the F pants off something you can do that would clearly add a new challenge and obey the rules that I say for ab training meaning get your rotation in get your challenge rotation and change the relative direction of it top down or bottom so there you have it if you want to start training your core it doesn training it more it means you have to start training it smarter guys if you aren you head to athleen right now grab our 90-day training program we give you a complete day-by-day workout program as well as your ab workouts exactly what you have to do again short quick intense and covering these principles to make sure that you before I go guys make sure you do me one thing thumb the video up if you like it leave a comment again two videos a week now so let us know what else you want to see but I do have one other major announcement guys you remember the dorm room challenge we had a lot of guys that stepped up to the plate took a shot at it videotaped themselves and included their video response as I requested on that challenge I told everybody on Facebook if you haven Facebook guys it facebook.com we said that we would give away one bundle pack of our RX supplements for free to the person who did the best job on that that value we look through every one of them I was the final judge so if you want to get mad at me this is is the person you one guy in particular hubner 92 hubner 92 you can see his video over here I post it up over here he did an incredible job he did 17 reps of that yes there were guys that did more but h92 was the only guy to put that belly of his flat up against the uh the wall each and every time he did a rep he did it that few inches as you guys know when you approaching vertical is really tough if you haven then you can click on that here now and make sure you go over and watch that and you can even try your best too that said guys this is the type of stuff we do

The SIX PACK ABS Sizzler - Advanced Ab Exercise!!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuYiS3WXIMQ	ATHLEAN - X	h [Music] H hey guys Jeff cavaliere from athleanx.com uh back here in the Xbox with our newest video it an AB killer guys and U if you know me by now you know it ordinary run-of-the-mill uh core exercise and there I think that um you can get much more out of your abs you can actually make it much more effective Ive exercise if you to do the exercise remember this whole area doesn works whenever we do anything if I were to pull this band down you could see how the body actually activates and that very important that if you do proper out training that you actually build that into what you going to show you an exercise I to use a band first but don you don a deal because I something that you can do with the wall to get the same effect but with the aan elastics bands here um basically what you want to do is hang one high and I going to show you a variation when you hang one a little bit lower but hang one up high over a squat rack over anything a pullup bar okay now this is the tricky part you got to get your foot into the band pretty much just like that now come down to the ground put both feet in okay now I here but my upper body is working don that kid you that your upper body is not working it is now I just a little bit and now I Crunch in and back in and back now the role of the ABS is to flex the spine it rotate but in this case we flexion of the lower back down and I upper body obviously with my shoulders here so I could actually drop that down do a pushup if I wanted to get a real you know um you know extra extra bit for the upper body now you can do this exercise I you can do this exercise with a TRX that cost $187 or an athl elastics band that cost less than 30 it to make it a lot harder put your feet in lower down here I why now I don to have this thing support me way up I actually got to use a lot of my upper body here to to hold myself up otherwise if I just let go I drop so now I and pulling in okay so an exercise looks like that now I promise you a version if you didn get a wall we wall come up against it going to put your feet flat into the wall keep your upper body out just support it now again as soon as I get into this position right here I hold myself up so what we is cross body here drive your foot into the wall cross body [Applause] where obliques you alternate 10 and 10 or until your upper arms give out and your smashing face on the floor and whichever one comes first is the tough exercise so guys don doing all the same uh basic crunches um basic sit-ups if that abdominal development to the next level you got to start training them the way that they need to be trained and again athletex is all about that in that the concepts that are applied in the Athletics training program are the same ones that I would use training my athletes is that don isolation so much bring muscle groups together that are meant to work together so you can develop them the way they should be if you haven to aex.com and uh grab the 90-day Training Program full of exercises and combinations just like this that may be unique to you but they unique to your muscles and that going to challenge you and help you develop a whole new uh body that you you probably haven what on the other programs you following so head to aex.com right now guys we another great video next week and if you want to you the bands they alex.com El sx.com all right guys talk to you soon thanks [Music] h h [Music]	Success
SIX PACK FIX - How To Put ABS in EVERY Exercise!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAmHQDJHf9I	ATHLEAN - X	is split muscle training really possible with athle X I it [Music] what aex.com we split muscle Group Training and whether or not it really is possible well if you which is what we look like an athlete it shouldn possible I today I exercises and show how you can tweak them with just a small small change to make them much more than just a shoulder movement so if we started with a front dumbbell lad or a front dumbbell raise right we could be right here trying to work just through the front of our shoulders but why do that when we can easily add some core training on to what we body in position in relation to the weight so I have a low cable here you can hook up a low band here it could be around the bottom of a bed post or wherever you want to Anchor it to but if I step out just to the side here okay out in front into the side what you going to see is my preos is going to stretch and work my coronal baks just from having to be in that position all right so from here with that load I can come up towards the top and now work the front of my shoulders here but at the same time have to control and decelerate that down through my core my obliques and actually and through my low back at the same time so we can make it a really explosive movement too by accelerating it up and then having to again decelerate on the way down so we can tie our core into everything we do just by changing body position around in relation to the exercise that you just grab your dumbbells come straight out here and do your front shoulder raise when you have so many more options at your disposal all of which the types of things that we cover in the athex program next another sort of unique way to get this side or medial head of the deltoid again we grab it doesn be a low cable guys it can be you know again a band down low up here and we going to pull it up towards the top so both thumbs up here towards the top this is not an upright row where your elbows are higher than your hands which you sinking down in front of your chest because that into an impingement position here we actually coming out elbows down thumbs up okay just like that from here you can see we can get that medial head of the deltoid involved okay but now why don we take that a step further and change the position of our body in relation to the weight or the resistance we take a little bit of an open stance so that again preload I just by doing this Reaching Across you can see how I activate a lot more muscles in my core so I across and then down the focus here is on the left side at the moment again even the low back and that position is going to have to work to pull up if I want to work the other side I just drop it back open up in here and again rotate pull up high work the right side [Music] okay so the lesson here is split muscle Group Training you you you train biceps today with athl NE yeah you can train shoulders you can train biceps but at the same time you getting a lot more work done because we every single exercise we in together groups that prefer to work together if we can guarante dantee that we are pulling with our biceps as well so nothing works in isolation it way if you into the field it way if you gym guys we here 2012 it an athlete to look like an athlete as I said last week that in weight training that all headed if you haven on board team athleen become part of this growing movement athl X guys we be back here again next week in the meantime aex.com I guys here in s days it [Music] a	Success
AB EXERCISE & AB WORKOUT - Intense Anti Gravity Ab Exercises	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylknLJ1Mx_U	ATHLEAN - X	home sweet home back in the x-box and ready to get right down to business [Music] what here athleanx.com and God does it feel good to be back in the Xbox it was only a couple weeks ago that I left you with the walk doing the walk the local after that my appendix said goodbye to me and I was out of commission for a couple weeks but here I am back and ready to go and some people are like geez you think you too soon and I say no because if you training the right way you yourself it all starts from the core and you can have a strong core it through the muscles down there you can bounce back quickly because you to five for that type of stuff whether you surgery or a long layoff and I firmly firmly believe that so what I wanted to do today will show you another cool core exercise that you can incorporate and explain to you the different ways that the core works and why this is a great way to Train it to show you that again all of your exercises start and finished with the core so you can keep your core strong you can pass back a lot quicker all right the first thing we do here is I don you need are a couple bands that you can hang over your pull-up bar and you can do the same exact thing so you the resistance up then you down into a push-up position so you gonna probably have the sneaker on the side once I get started here to see exactly what I down into a push-up position so I have to really push hard and down here in here now once you try this you see right away that your core starts firing up just because you have to hold these bands down onto the ground right because they want to pull me up that way I have to flex the core to hold myself in position now let one sort of a of a myth that everyone likes to jump on the bandwagon and say you can they exercise your abs that but one of the main things that your core does is it is the spy okay so whether you your back or whether you knees here and you and that the ABS are responsible for so if anybody tells you stop doing crunches it now just crunches would be the worst thing you can do but stop doing crunches all together that want to do is you want to get into the position you actually are flexing them the the back in order to get to this position here okay now once you the first the way the drill starts is you want to just raise one arm out in front of you okay so that makes it harder because I want to extend through the back but I have to flex the back you know the ABS to keep me there so raise up and raise up and you be doing alternate raises honey okay but now here everybody gets fun if I let this thing go out to my side now I have to control rotation here and then generate rotation to get me back down to the ground okay let it go up it wants to snap you right up okay but I have to control rotation that of the ABS is to control and decelerate this rotation here why because as it takes me this way I have to contract the ABS and rotate back down to the ground obviously same thing here and I have to contract back down in the ground up to the side track down to the ground so now you can lift out and then up and then out and then up down now I don been out of the gym for a week and a half or what or persistence exercise but it is killing my abs in a good way of course okay so point is guys how we said you have to fortify your core and everything you do and that focus on in athlean-x every single exercise in the program works on getting your core involved so that it integrates upper body and lower body not only does it make your core stronger but it also makes the other muscle groups work together since you every single lift and overall increase your muscle size and strength it key but most of all have strong core allows you to bounce back whether it layoff from an injury level from a surgery or just being out of the gym keeping that core strong is essential to what you feels great to be back I hope you enjoyed the live Q&A if you did it I put a link to it over here and make sure you check that out we did that last week on YouTube we for sure but for now it good to be back in the gym I back to my strength and more and more challenging things to come taking my alright supplements to a very key component of recovery guys I appreciate all the time recovery recovery recovery I idiot here in the gym doing exercises I and then I everything properly and taking everything here I supplements so guys I will see you back here in seven days and again hopefully feeling even stronger and better and increasing the challenge even more for not only me here but for you as well in the meantime I athleanx.com [Music]	Success
How to Get Insane Abs (3-D AB TRAINING VIDEO!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n43lnn5QUE	ATHLEAN - X	what know it the best ab exercise ever but this truly is one of the best ab exercises ever if not the best if you your abs like an athlete now we talk about training you entirely like an athlete here on the athletx channel but this particular exercise is one of my favorites for the core because we going to hit your core the way it meant to be hit we from all three angles let me show you the exercise right off the bat this is a side plank pull the side plank pull is an awesome exercise because we are actually training the ABS through all their function and we multiple directions we all three planes of motion so let me break it down here for you we three planes of motion that we operate in the first is the sagittal plane which is the front to back movements that we do then we have our frontal plane which is a side to side movements and then the all important transverse plane but sometimes we don right the muscles can be working by preventing movement in any one of those planes as well and that exercise does a great job of and because we usually lack stability in our cores if we to build the stability in all three planes so back to the exercise again in this exercise take a look first and foremost at that Sagal plane we driving our knee up into our chest and that back that and a flexion of the spine is an AB generated movement it movement there sure but if you get your butt most importantly to curl under and you get your pelvis to go into a posterior tilt you we the bat then we go into our next two important functions we have through the uh the virtue of the side plank we have a frontal plane hold so if you look at me from really down low here you can see that if I start doing this exercise improperly I lose the stability of my core by allowing my hip to drop down to the ground with each rep that not what you want if you this right you got to keep your hip elevated whatever you set it at should be parallel there to the rest of your body your whole torso should be in one line from your leg and your ankle all the way up to your shoulder you keep it there the entire time now the most important thing the band and if you doing this to a gym it doesn you don cable machine to do this exact same exercise I just wanted to show you the home equip equalent by using just a resistance band here when you look at it from the top you can see that if I pull the band now I component front to back am I allowing the momentum of the band to actually rock me back into a posterior uh rotation here if I do then I the exercise right anti- rotation is one of the biggest uh jobs of our core and you can see that with every pull it enough of a of a disrupting uh disrupting pattern to my core strength that it knocks me over or it pulls me forward when I go back you don either of these so this exercise is great for testing us and our strength in all three of these planes and also helping us to build our strength in all three of these planes and guess what like I said you could do it with just one move so who knew AB training was all that complicated actually guys it really isn function of your core and you have to make sure that you all of its functions it functions there we can do with our ABS that a lot of people don doing top down movements mid-range movements bottom up movements bottom up rotation top down rotation anti- rotation there functions of the ABS the cool thing is we can work them in a much more Consolidated way if we know the right exercises to do I all out for you guys I ground workor as a PT this is what we specialize in having you do exercises in all three plans of motion so we can get you more bang for your buck get you in and out in a much faster time and get you a better core in theend in the at the end of the day if you a program I for you on top of the fact that I covering all of your other workouts to help you train like an athlete not just right here but to train your whole body then head to athlet x.com and get our athletex trading system in the meantime make sure watch for Wednesday here tell me what else it is that you want me to cover here on these videos and I sure that I cover the core related topic that you want to see in the meantime if you found this video helpful and you going to try this exercise out make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below and I just a few days with yet another video all right guys I soon	Success

Let from what we did the last week. Last week I got you doing some uh different exercises that you were supposed to do at least five times a week. Um hopefully every day because again, ab training can be done every single day. That we Don overtrain your abdominal area and you got to give it a rest and it simply not true. The other thing we talked about was covering some of the basics in terms of getting enough water. Keep drinking your water. Keep doing that trick with the rubber bands if you need to. If you don anymore, great. If you do, there problem doing it. Just make sure you get enough water. We also talked about the diet. I hope you made that change with the uh you know, cutting down the fats in your diet and you some results. Results are going to be what keep you going. Results are going to be the the the selfm motivating factor that get you guys to stick with this program. So, it that you follow what we say each week so that you can get those results and feel motivated and keep going. This week, what we things. Nothing new really about this, but the big physio ball and just a weight plate, standard, you know, weight plate. This is 25 lbs. It could be 10. It could be a dumbbell. Anything. But that going to be back here in the Xbox again. Our little C cubicle or a little bit of space. That to have any fancy equipment to get done what we need to get done. One thing I want to cover for this week theme or or episode is, you know, it getting nicer outside here in Connecticut. We weather. It in the 90s. Now, there opportunities for not doing what we saying. There There you know what? I golf. I buddies. I a baseball game. Do anything but do our workout. Guys, it only takes 10 minutes. It this done. I suggest doing it first thing in the morning. Find a time that you know you can routinely do it every single day. Whether that be at night before dinner, after dinner, in the morning, whatever it is for you when you know you minutes to do it. All right, so let get started with this week and let right, guys. First exercise we to cover this week is called the plate eight. Really, what we taking a plate and we figure eight in the air with the plate. Real easy, real simple to describe. Not that easy to do, but what you have to do is lean back onto your onto your tailbone, legs off the ground, plate in front of you, firmly held on to with both hands, start to drop it down to the side, almost like you Some people call these canoes. We call them plate eights. You make your figure eights. Knees come in a little bit each time I come down just like so. It Our second exercise for this week of washboard Wednesday again uses our plate. We recliner press. Take your plate here. Let yourself recline. As you come in, press the plate up. Down. Press it up. Go through these slow. Get a little upper body work through the shoulders. And you working your core. A to stabilize and b to do the crunch portion of it. All right, moving on guys to exercise number three. This week we have the side pillar twist. Pillar strength. You want to work on the muscles all the way down our sides obviously to keep you keep you strong like a pillar. Upright and strong like a pillar. What we do here is get on our side. Come up into a side bridge. Elbows should stay right beneath your shoulder for support. You don be out here. You don far over it that way. Up here. Look up at your hand. Reach underneath. That going to challenge the left hand side of your uh abdominal area into your obliques. Come back up and let your bridge come down. Bridge up, reach up and down. Bridge, reach it further if you can. Each time see if you can reach a little further. It fourth exercise for this week, the physio ball roll out. You guys have seen those things before where you with the wheel in the middle. Um, abdi sort of a a version of that too, but the the one that has the wheel, I don remember the name of it. But what the the purpose is that we to duplicate that with this physio ball. This is multi-purpose. We can do so many things with this. Upper body, lower body. We can do abs with it, too. So, let the ball. Kind of sitting back, not totally on our heels, but up a little bit. Engage your core. Let yourself roll out right there. You feel your stomach working hard and pull yourself back in. Don got to pull in with your stomach. Crunch. Try and create a crunch. Round your back out. Okay. So, come on out and crunch. That this physio ball roll out. But if you want to get a little advanced, get yourself anchored up against the wall. Got the little brick here in the Xbox, but any any wall will do. Get up here. Now, as I roll out, I and lift my body up out right there and roll back down. Come out, roll down. at this position here. Don your abs engaged. Keep your stomach up. Okay, we one for the last one this week. It called the physio ball skier tuck. There doesn upon where you put your knees on the ball. What you do is position the ball underneath your Let easier version. Put the ball underneath our knees. Okay, hands down squarely on the floor beneath our shoulders. Going to pull up and basically turn. I want you to point here. I camera. All right, so pointed to your left, straighten out, then come back to the right. Okay, get a little bit of momentum like so. Want to make it harder? Put that ball out there. Get under the toes. Do the same thing right there. Wherever you find it most challenging, that stick with for this week. All right, guys. That third week of washboard Wednesday. Stick with these exercises for the next week. Try to get them in every single day if you can. get better and better each and every week at these things. Keep drinking your water. Keep cutting out the fats and find that time of the day when you can work out and get it in routinely. Don going to be a lot of distractions coming up.

Six Pack Abs Challenge - THE 200 REP AB SCORCHER!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ873MX85dU	ATHLEAN - X	Laer fear of mathletics calm here with Ben may the winner of the first mr. X of the Year award for his transformation that he made in the last well I basically he followed the program about seven months ago really did an amazing job you could read all about it over the the blog from athleanx about his his specific numbers and his ability to drop you know almost what fifteen percent body fat or thirty percent body fat and and really transform himself and get more muscular lean Oh Ben is here he uh he his award for being for his accomplishments to the Xbox spending a couple days with me we wanted to take the opportunity to sort of create an ab exercise or do something for you guys that you would find valuable I think now Ben went through the program one of his I guess favorite or one of the ones that he that everybody worked it out of the favorites the right word but worth his as was the connections I might show me the canoe exercise so the committee like this as if you canoe and then you pretend to paddle right so you you yourself sort of in that isometric position at the same time you there we kind of talked about he starting to master that and get a little bit you know how that become a little easy but the nice thing I could think about athlean-x is that the exercises that are in this program now like other unique and most of all very different from probably some of the things you done in the past or you but I like Athena they what I mean by that is is your exercises that can always be made to be harder to adapt to your level of strength so we can make it quite a challenge I done something through it for the first okay so I don call it but maybe you know maybe something call it torture but really what you come and you come back down you can start and it know as that roll up from the Pilate so roll up would be coming up here trying to get some flexibility back here a roll up now you down to the ground right one vertebrae at a time really working your abs now I position we know you I want to see you shake and lift the legs up put your hands up on your head now I want you to rotate down in the ground and rotate down to the ground just like that no cheating you can and drop your elbows you got to actually rotate your shoulders 40 times 20 and 20 all right now crank them out a little bit of a pace there you go good feeder up still abs are engaged still have the rotation still have that component of a canoe I have an account when you get your 20 and 20 let me know five four three okay now he straight up again feet can touch your ground is going to stretch one stretch come back down keep it there stop again another 40 guess how many rounds we doing to this been a minute we five rounds of this so you reps okay this is going to be quite a challenge so I want you to crank it out keep it going I breath you are and how much you know close to death you are but I them the play-by-play but you just keep cranking out the exercise okay and that gets his stretch he better stretch each time because that one of the kind of principles of Pilates as you continue to actively go through these motions you will increase your flexibility through your low back so in the middle of his third round here he gonna get over the hump when he can finally get through this one good he not cheating a cheat would be just to drop that elbow without a rotation come on hang in there two more there you go he he his good posture he technique drop it just elbow to elbow down it down good he wincing in his eyes so I getting towards the end come on for anymore treat these ones are the most important ones right use the one we in the most amount of fatigue these ones that count a lot of times it says other reps I get you to this point here they do this there to get you to the point where it really matters there you go now how much easier is this than they do canoes easy oh no no no right so basically we took an exercise like the canoe that you were doing a great job but we nother level yeah and that thing might a thing thanks guys is that you know we you start the athlean-x program there change this is there there you being overweight out-of-shape right it a lifestyle and it evolves with you so if you the fence about wondering about whether this program would work for you or whether you would have grow the program trust me catch you won program you know I will make sure that bed never outgrow this program and you don but that you know with these open-ended exercises to be able to modify them they can be more difficult so Ben thanks again he did an unbelievable job we actually come back here again we two videos have been this week a really cool workout that he wanted to do he said hey Jeff what if I had like a min class I knock out everything in one workout like a total body workout what would you recommend how would you structure that cope with something really good and we this week in a whole new way so the double of the double X destroyer I think I was about it you exactly what

this guy by now because he like a little athlete celebrity but Adam Jarvis back here 37 years old and I have to say that this is probably one of my favorite moments in the Xbox for the reason that a lot of guys want to know what happens what do I do after aane X I what that we saw you when you were in your greatest shape right but what about now you know are you still in great shape and I can attest cuz I next to you that you are not even in great shape but better than you were before absolutely you can actually prove that to the people let he want to know you program two more times since then yes absolutely so now why why for you has it been able have you been able to go through it and continue to not only enjoy it and not not you know get bored with it but actually still get results like this because everything is constantly changing and it same my body never gets used to after the 90 days there workouts yeah that my body never gets to adapt to any workout so my body there there there workouts a week there different workouts in athl X because it one never repeats itself so it impossible for your body to you know to not um you know to to adapt to anything to to actually stop producing gain so for the people that want to know what can you do ath X is a program you can literally do for life cuz you can continue to go through it and still get the results cuz really literally you have actually gotten more muscular since the last time I saw you well that was basically because of the meal plans that really helped me out quite a bit um I was able to eat five six times a day um preparation the ease of eating um I eating more than I um you used to struggle big time with your eating absolutely because it was always trying it difficult to differentiate my carbs and my proteins and you simplify it so much that it and and the key thing is that you simple easy and the fact that you said you eating more than you ever have you know and that guys you got to feed this muscle that you now couple cool things that we to do here the first thing is uh I letting you off easy it you here it are over now it because he was sort of like my original X-Man now now I want to I take him through one of the exercises that I originally put out that X-Man crunch right and I kind of played around with a little bit more and made it more challenging than it ever has before so you it out so all we going to have you lay down here I going to show you guys an exercise that you could do with a partner or you just anchor this band around like a a squat rack or something that you could you can anchor around but just a regular band ad is going to lay down add the EXT man crunch so basically what I have you do is you end of the band here one end here those feet will be wide apart okay it off the ground when you start your arms will be up over your head in that X position wide and then they come down to the ground as you bring yourself up and then press up so it little bit of that heels to the heavens exercise that we go through but at the same time you angles that you you at the same time so we to put you through this and I want your your pinion at the end you got it all right so arms start off there everything then everything in there and press all right so then everything wide everything comes in press and down now you know it takes the X-Men Crunch and it makes it uh you know pretty much like uh xman crunch crunch you right you got two parts to it and we taking the difficulty level up give me uh two more come on and up and press arms up wide everything wide stabilize up press down cool all right so that you little bit more advanced version I only did eight reps with you you look like you know we continue to make these abs pop and keep them going right absolutely all year round now here what I want say uh and what I want to start doing now it able to bring you guys the information I love being able to uh you put new workouts together for you put new exercises challenge you in different ways but I think some people sometimes think that Jeff it because a that living and B um you just you know you you kind of have you you long that your body so long and you to look that way and I look that way well I don really don for longer than you guys do um I have a lot of other things that I work on I work on the business itself and it really gets to be you know pretty hectic but I think it to hear from you and hear from the guys and you out there that actually go through the program so because I to have access to Adam here I want to have you guys be able to ask your questions for Adam for what he went through being that he shoes that you are when he put yourself when he decided 7 months ago to put himself through actually 10 months ago to

5 Things Supplements WONÂT Do (REALITY CHECK!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JNKbvvS3rM	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com today we supplements but not what you might think instead of talking about all the good things that supplements can do we want to talk about the five things that supplements won don acknowledge these five things your sup list will never do what you were hoping they to cover them first up guys we to talk about the fact that supplementation will never overcome a lack of focus or training intensity I made the same mistake I have to be honest when I first started to train the number one thing I did was worry about which hot supplement I was going to take literally I was taking something called hot stuff because at the time everybody on the high school football team was taking it it was the hot thing and I was so focused on just making sure that I got that and took that that everything else became secondary my workout intensity who cares to focus on how to do the exercises who cares the fact that I was half reppin everything who cares as long as I was taking the supplement everything was good that your supplementation that way you have the equation 100% backwards think about supplementing as quickly as you possibly can get it in and then get over to the gym and spend all your time focusing on doing the exercises right training with your hardest intensity and making sure that you know how to do everything to its fullest every single time so you can get the most out of every gym experience supplementation will never ever overcome a lack of training intensity the next two things that supplements will not do are both related to nutrition and the first of those is that supplements will never help you to overcome poor food selection or a poor diet guys I talked about this all the time if your body fat levels are 30 35 40 % focusing on what supplements you wrong focus you need to instead be worried about getting solid foundational nutrition and improving the foods that you the impact that these supplements can actually have on your physique is about as impactful as throwing a single deck chair off the Titanic or as Jesse says [\\xa0__\\xa0] with a broken condom we drew up this video to bring you a public service announcement for all the athleanx.com don Willie good luck out there boys it just doesn nutrition in check first and then start worrying about supplementation as it becomes more necessary to take you to the next level and continuing on with nutrition supplements should never be used to replace that good nutrition that we just talked about a lot of people will look at supplementation and say I meal replacement or I this meal in favor of this supplement and I don looked at that way think of supplements as supplementing that good nutrition plan you each and every meal as opposed to replacing a meal why because I just don marketed that way they supplement taken in liquid form is going to replace all the benefits you your solid meals and meeting all your micronutrient and your macronutrient needs throughout the day guys someone should always always always supplement the foods you opposed to try to replace them next up supplements do not negate the need for other supplements guys if you look at supplementation the right way it should be very prescriptive there should be a reason why you you they that you are trying to achieve in the gym so just because you pre-workout doesn that you couldn formula especially if you have joint pain or just because you are taking a protein doesn necessarily couldn pre-workout the fact is if you supplementation right you should be looking at the way that that supplement ingredients specifically or if you looking at a product that has all these ingredients together that the benefits of each of these together are going to have on your training creatine alone is going to benefit a very specific purpose and a high energy power output lower reps in your training whereas if beta alanine on the other hand is going to increase your ability to perform at higher rep ranges more in the 10 to 12 rep range where hypertrophy might be your goal so depending upon what you supplementation needs should vary and taking one thing does not preclude the need for others if you have those benefits and last but not least one thing supplements cannot do is equate to you being healthy look I get it let you right intensity your nutrition is in check and you are supplementing your supplementing with a purpose and you benefiting from it if the rest of your lifestyle however is not conducive to being healthy then the supplements are not going to outdo or overcome any of that if you find that you too much if you find that you recreational drugs for all the wrong reasons if you find that you are smoking if you find that you have a lot of lifestyle habits your stress levels are through the roof it doesn you standpoint even if you are so dialed in that does not mean that you person and I think a lot of people get confused by that and they think that just because their gym habits have them dialed in and healthy it doesn necessarily overcome the fact that their lifestyle might be getting out of hand so there you have it guys there things that supplements will not do and remember this is coming from somebody that always a supplement company you see I on you or deceive you or BS you the fact is all I misconceptions head-on so that you are more informed about your supplements in the benefits that supplementation can have if you take them in the right doses at the right time for the right purpose because then and only then will they be incredibly impactful on the results that you see from your training and even how well you perform in your training if you take you to the next level we put the science back in supplementation over Daphne XCOM you can grab our entire bundle over there in the meantime if you found this video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know what you also you want me to cover here in a future video and I do that for you alright guys see you soon [Music] you	Success
5 Reasons to Take Supplements (AND WHEN YOU NEVER SHOULD!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sREg8GrkPio	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] What Cavalierx.com. Today I you to determine whether or not supplements are a right fit for you. Supplements are not the right fit for everybody. But you can ask yourself a series of questions and determine whether or not you are a candidate. And it starts right here in our yes or no with where are you at in terms of your program. Are you just starting out? Are you a beginner? Are you a real skinny guy who before in your life? Because guess who knows somebody that is like that? I do because that Matter of fact, this is my actual very first dumbbell that I ever used. And you can see it right there. That pounder. This 5 pounder went on to allow me to start lifting a lot heavier weight. But I started with that. And a matter of fact, my brother told me growing up, you have to earn the right, earn the privilege to be able to start taking supplements. Because if you just starting out with really light weights and you sophisticated with your training yet, supplementation is overkill. You much better off figuring out the basics and understanding how to start building your body from the ground up, learning the proper movements, the right way to train, how to put it all together before you start, you know, finessing it with supplements. Okay. On the same other the other end of the spectrum with the same note, if you yourself to get incredibly out of shape, 40% body fat or above because of your absolutely poor nutrition habits, trying to fix them with supplementation is not the right way either. So, you want to make sure that you you shape, you a while, and you to the next level, then you would be a yes. But otherwise, if you starting in either one of those extremes, you here as a no. Here I know a lot of you can probably relate to, but I am actually living it and breathing it every single day right now. And that is high levels of stress. And it doesn could be good stress. In my case, it is good stress. We came a little bit early. That stressful. But we to grow and develop and sort of catch up to where they need to be. That provided a lot of stress in my life. But guess what? I I I can. But as I covered in my nutrition video the other day where I showed you some fast ways that I can create lots of meals at once. I that here if you haven already. Um stress is present in my life right now. And even more so supplementation can help you to overcome stress because it can do two things. Number one, we know how nutrition can be a large component of providing your body with the fuel it needs to stay healthy even in the face of stress. And we also know that we don time to prepare it in stressful times. So supplementation can be extremely uh easy to prepare and allow you to be consistent with your nutrition. So for me, I supplements than I am right now because I get good nutrition. The the the cafeteria at the hospital isn place for me to get proper nutrition. But if I can mix up a shake, take it with me, and know that I optimum nutrition at my fingertips whenever I need it, it becomes even that much more imperative. I will say if you yourself in a high stress situation, and you don nutrition and you still want to be able to train, you stress to your body, make sure at that point that you absolutely incorporate some form of supplementation to allow your body to recover that much faster, to allow you to bounce back even better. Okay, the next one is actually a personal question that I bring it down, bring it in here and get manto man with you and ask you to be honest with yourself. Are you the type of person who takes your supplements and then finds yourself eating crappy foods because you figured you already did what you were supposed to do? If that then supplements are not for you, okay? They point to be learned from all this and that is sometimes supplements will make that person much more accountable for the rest of their actions throughout the day. So you go and you spend all your hardearned money on your supplements, okay? And you take them religiously. You take them regularly. You have that opportunity then to kind of screw off and do what you know you shouldn doing to be in line with what you trying to achieve with your physique. You become much more aware knowing how much money you spent on your supplements, knowing the hard work that you spent in the gym and the time and the effort that you put into the gym to do what you knew you were supposed to do. You become less likely to kind of fall off the beaten path where you know you shouldn supplementation become incredibly can become incredibly important and can make you accountable for all of your actions beyond the time when you supplements. Anybody can take a supplement. That thing we can ever do. And that many people love to take them because we all know how simple it is to mix something up and drink it. But it goes on in all the other hours and minutes surrounding the time that you take your supplements that counts. And if it makes you more accountable, then absolutely I think that they should be part of your plan. Especially if you that type of person. Okay. The next question you want to ask yourself is whether or not you when I say athlete, I don mean professional athlete. Matter of fact, we have a lot of guys that train here with this channel to look more athletic. But if you better start taking your supplementation seriously because if you don tell you right now, you left behind. Having just come back from the winter meetings last month in Nashville, Tennessee, the major focus of the strength and conditioning coaches at the major league level is supplementation. Because let the game of baseball has undergone some serious changes in the last few years to eliminate drugs from the game. It was a large portion of how players sort of prepared themsel every year, but that gone. That need to be able to they need to be able to replace that with some real solid research evidencebacked supplements to allow them to take their game to the next level. And those that aren it are going to fall behind. And the same thing could be said here again for those that sort of want to take their not just their performance, but their physique to the next level. Again, you on that path. You want to take it to the next level. Those are the guys that need to start looking into uh the benefits of supplementation. Okay. Last but not least, we or false here. I question. I want you to answer which side you think. Do you think that you can get all your benefits of supplementation through food alone? That you don the benefits of the things you to supplement with? I second here. Okay, I can end that now, the suspense, because the answer is a resounding false. And I you two just two examples of this. When people try to take a supplement, let just say they right? a joint formula and they taking glucosamine. They people that would argue that they can get the glucosamine that they would get say in our athlete mechanics. Where are you getting that from? Are you eating? Are you out there at a restaurant ordering surf and turf and telling them to hold the lobster meat and just give you the shell because it tastes so damn good? Where are you what are you eating to get the glucosamine that you need to gain the benefits of the supplement? Now, does everybody have to take a joint formula? No. But if you me that you formula and get or you want the benefits of glucosamine from a joint formula, but you don kidding yourself. You I add up. And the same thing could be said about creatin, one of the most wellressearched supplements out there. There of research behind it backing its efficacy for anybody that trains. We have our creatine and our RX2 post-workout supplement. And I can ask you again, where are you getting your creatine from? And I hear it all the time, Jeff, you can get creatine from meat. Jeeoff, you can get creatin from tuna. Let example. Tuna has actually 4.5 grams of creatin per guess. Get ready. Okay. 16 ounces of tuna. So that tuna. Okay. Four and a half grams of creatine is great. That for you. But you guess what? You know, if you know anything about creatine that in order to gain the benefits here, you So that means you take 16 ounces of tuna daily. That means that your budget is going to have to provide you with the opportunity to buy tuna at 16 ounces, which is one pound at around $17 to $25 a pound depending upon sushi grade or not every single day. So when we start thinking about where your monthly bill is going to be, oh, I don know, maybe 500 bucks to get your creatin. Does that make sense? Not to mention, you with mercury poisoning along the way. That doesn way for you to get creatin. Does everybody need creatin? No. I saying they all do, but don and say, Jeff, I want to get the benefits of creatin, and I do uh doing it through my regular diet and through the foods that I eat. It ain Again, a big false. If you want the benefits of spec specific ingredients to get the erogenic benefits, then you better start realizing that most likely you too. If you benefits, then you don need it. And as I said in the very beginning, if you going to take your supplements and think that that hard work goes out, you think that supplements are a replacement for hard ass work, then guess what? If you do me a favor, don least because it don answer for everybody. But I think that the majority of the people that follow this channel and follow the advice that I give here are a little bit more serious about their training. And in those cases, in a lot of the examples I just gave you here, you might be fitting one of those. Then supplements are something you should probably look into if you want to start taking your results to the next level. We have our supplements, guys. I them every single day. Every time I do a video here, we arx.com. In the meantime, if you found this video helpful or in the very least refreshingly honest, then please do me a favor, leave your comments, your thumbs up below. Let me know. Tell me what else it is that you want me to cover here on this channel, maybe regarding supplements, and I that here in the coming weeks. All right, guys. I soon.	Success
Bodybuilding Supplements Video - The SCARY TRUTH!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqfM_QBYNFs	ATHLEAN - X	if you people that are working out and using supplements then you make sure you watch this video cuz it may change what you your body and to me that would be a good thing what aex.com I decided to do something a little bit different this week you know I said let cover a whole other aspect of something that I know you guys out there are most most likely doing and that supplements in some way shape or form I grew up using supplements I played Sports in high school I tried Amino fuel Hot Stuff metrics with Dr Scott Connelly animal pack cybergenics the point of the matter is I used them all guys and and I believed in all of them when I took them so what I wanted to do this week was put together a video where we look at the bodybuilding supplement industry and really kind of cover some of the most shocking things that I discovered as I went through all right so one of the main questions that is always on the minds of everybody it should be on the minds of those that are taking supplements are right here on my computer I supplements worth the money or are they a waste of my money I come out there and say that you absolutely need supplements you absolutely need you see results no you results from hard training and a good nutrition but if you want to see that extra Edge or if you want to make your job of nailing your nutrition easier it supplementing your diet with you know uh some of these ingredients because some of them simply can dosages that are been shown to be effective in you through regular normal nutrition you have to sort of go to outside sources and and you have to be able to call the ingredients in certain you know certain amounts to get those benefits that you able to get from eating real food so are supplements a big benefit yes the first thing that you might hear is about fillers and what is in your supplements not really actually being on the label you the bottles that you have right now and see if anybody has magnesium ster in as one of the ingredients because I can tell you it not something you should be using in your body magnesium sterate is actually a filler that the goal this is the stuff that I told you guys that when I decided to do the athlan RX series when I found out about some of this stuff we were really shocked by it and determined to make sure we didn sterate the goal of the manufacturer is to put this agent into your supplements because it helps the ingredients when they Machinery which requires less cleanup which requires less labor that they paying for which requires less uh maintenance of the machines because they do happen to break down if these things get gummed up well there all for the consumer if you consumer taking you don ster as a matter of fact it interferes with some of your ability to uh your immune system it kind of interferes with your immune system in certain cells in your body you don certainly don supplements and all I you want to make sure that you do something about it the next thing I think we should cover here is the percentage of active ingredient again this is something that FDA there are certain percentages of active ingredients that are standards for the ingredients that are in your products so for example if we take something like Cas and protein Cas and protein comes either most likely two uh potencies 80% or 90% what that means is that your body or your your body can process and absorb 80% of what in that amount so if you let only able to absorb 16 G well not even forget absorb you active Cas and protein stuff that can actually do something to help you build muscle in 20 80% of That So 20% Which would be four uh four G of it would go away so companies aren going to say that most often that oh well we have 20 grams of protein and casing protein in our our blend yeah that really all you use when we just set out to do the RX series I said tell me the bottom line I want guys to make a judgment on the protein they from the bottom line of what what they system what are they going to use because we know we have to have some of that go away in the absorption process and when we break it down so if a company is telling you there good that 80% of it is only is all you looking at 16 on some of them and then less than that because your body to break some of it down so when we talk about do supplements work yeah they they work if you know that you can trust the brand that you might be thinking you in actuality you all right so this next one might come as a shock to some of you guys and I have to admit it did to me as well I think back to what I went through as a teenager going into the supplement stores and I would ask them what is the best thing for me to take or best things for me to take I would save up my money to spend it on something if I felt like it would work but I my you know my my my own fate in the hands of one of these sales reps thinking that they and the reality is even today more than ever these sales reps are often times incentivized by the manufacturer to recommend things that they may not necessarily feel are best why because it means more money in their pockets you might find that you go into a specific supplement store and ask for a specific you know product and be swayed towards something else when you might have heard good results from your friends on on this other product the sad fact is is and then sometimes even the sales rep themselves have used the product that you initially went in there for but are going to be paid more by the manufacturer as an incentive as a kickback to recommend that brand over the other and that it it comes down to finding a brand that you trust because you know that it delivers what it says it deliver and you know that you can put your faith in that and your hard earn money and realize that you sort of told something just because there a hit list the safety of ingredients i in the in the I don it was 2011 I think and I made a statement on the inclusion of 13 dimethyl aamine in pre-workout products and I said that this stuff is going to be banned you know a matter of fact it should be banned but it banned at some point in time because it it companies were using in their pre-workouts guys you ultimately responsible for what you put in your body and I can only recommend things to you that I feel as good advice and things that you should listen to and then I can only help that from there you and make your own well-educated decision that was one of the videos where I sort of stepped out of character a little bit and I said emphatically guys do not use this try not to use this I know it very popular supplement in a very popular brand right now but try not to use this because you yourself in the process in your health and I kind of promise to continue to do that if I find an an ingredient that I feel is not safe had I been around doing videos back when the feder was out I would have said the same thing but if I find that and I go a little bit over the edge in my you know being emphatic about it just understand that I make sure that you guys know that these are not always regulated by the FDA they when they become a problem the FDA steps in they get rid of it but unfortunately they become a problem when a lot of people get hurt and potentially die from them first and then they come in and say wow a lot of people got hurt and died from this so we do something about it so the fact is you always want to make sure that what you that with athle RX every single thing we do we bottles to the nth degree and so much so that we the process of of of obtaining for all three of our supplements the NSF certified for sport designation that will allow us to be used by all of our Major League Baseball athletes NFL athletes PGA athletes guys that are being uh regulated by their sport uh in total to make sure that what they taking is safe as I mentioned earlier the FDA is not going to get involved in every single supplement that goes out so in a in a world where there regulation we decided maybe stupidly we want to be FDA compliant but it because I want to make sure that we hold ourselves to the highest standards as I said guys not all brands are bad there plenty of good brands out there but you have to know and trust that the brand that you towards is doing it the right way I can tell you this at athle RX we the right way everything you put in your body Matters from your nutrition to your supplementation don to get away with taking supplements if your nutrition sucks make sure that your nutrition is good supplementation follows and that combined potent one two combination is going to provide you with the best chance combined with a good workout program obviously to put on the most muscle and to stay as riting as possible if you haven you want to check out the supplements head over to athl rx.com or aex.com RX and check out the bundles you more on the entire bundle and as I said it bottles not having to buy 10 different things just to cover your needs we put it in exactly when you need it uh and when you and how much you need of it guys in the meantime we next week back in the gym more workouts head over to athl x.com check out also the workout program if you haven already started that perfect compliment for the supplements all right guys I see you back here in the 7 Days in the meantime have a great rest of your week [Music]	Success
Whey Protein: Everything You Need To Know!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_au4UOs4mw	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what don knows how important it is especially if you know what are we actually getting when we take it and there variations if we can put together a video here to help break that down that I thought it could be helpful so I want you guys to sort of Envision first of all what is wheight protein if we look at milk it it portion in that liquid portion we have not just protein but protein carbohydrates fats vitamins and minerals all that we have when we talk about the different kinds of whey protein are basically different stages in preparation of that protein to the point at which it gets to you so if we think about it it a three or four step process and where the manufacturer intervenes and puts it in a bottle is really what you getting so when you look at whey concentrate it basically taking that that separated out whe and filtering out the main impurities and then giving you the rest of it the thing is that could be 35 to 80% protein by weight that is a big variation guys between how much protein is actually in an amount of powder so if you it getting 10 active grams of protein in a concentrate luckily you know there some manufacturers will steer towards the high end I can tell you athl RX steers towards the high end to the highest end we use 80% in our concentrate so that for every 10 gram of the protein by volume you of the protein when we use our concentrate again we isolate in all of our proteins but just to point that out this is also going to have a higher concentration of lactose in it again less treatment less purification process more lactose so if you are a lactose intolerant person if you buy a whey concentrate you to find that you have a lot more gut issues having that than you would somewhere along the way down here we talk about these in a second it to retain a high percentage of the important subfractions we know that whe protein is important as an immune boosting uh agent well a lot of those important boosting uh properties come from the sub fractions like lactoferrin that are in Whey Protein those are going to be again untouched for the most part in weight concentrate so you have good immune boosting effects from concentrate the best actually then finally this is absorbed a little bit slower again because you have other components in here you are going to have some fat you are going to have some carbohydrates that gastric emptying of a concentrate versus an isolate when you compare them side by side next let so now if we treat that we take that concentrate and we treat it a little bit more then we have more benefits and sometimes more things that we don about it that at least 90% protein by weight okay so in order to have that for every 10 gram you have to at least be delivering nine active grams of protein and again we we score off the charts here we have a very high ratio of our whey isolate that we deliver in our athl supplements there are far less issues with lactose intolerance here why because almost all of the lactose is removed when you go through that additional p ation step of an isolate it may destroy immune boosting subfractions like lactoferrin because now the more we treat it the more that we start to break down some of those other components which we break down the protein into smaller and smaller peptides I say may because we the different ways in which whey protein isolate is prepared but before we do I and it is another way that is that is covered and that okay which is just basically hydroly protein you probably before some people will say this is the end all be all of protein I kind of don with here is yes the fastest absorbing form of protein because it is so broken down it individual peptides that actually kills all the we call quinary structures of protein but those are the lacto ferin and immune boosting sub fraction so you you do this and it has a it was actually done because they wanted to take out any of the the things that could be potentially allergenic right so these immune boosting fractions are also very highly uh acted upon by our body in some cases when there they see them as an allergy so you can have an allergic reaction to them that we formula that created in the first place and it going to taste awful because the amino acids once they the rest of their protein chains are bad we talked about it before the branch T amino acids when you break them down to individual components things like Lucine tastes God awful and Proline tastes God awul and they here so when you go to eat this it going to taste like crap the bottom line is before we talk about these last two things here is you got to understand guys that the the way that these are broken down they know is it dening the proteins we going to eventually whether these are broken down when they come in a bottle whether they gut your your body these things down eventually into their individual components so the argument some people will make about denaturing proteins guys when you take a a thing of egg Whit and you pour it into a hot pan to make your scrambled eggs you are denaturing that protein the thing is you properties of the protein when you do that you building properties it can still have a benefit or you would never be eat You never be finding any benefits from eating cooked proteins you everything Raw so don it really determines whether or not one is more right for you or not so of the isolate there most often a cross flow micro filtration and an ion exchange uh preparation with the ion exchange preparation Guys these are usually treated with chemicals like hydrochloric acid and other reagents that basically do the splitting they licing they proteins into individual components that really need to have uh foreign chemicals introduced into here to do the to do the breaking down for us we that in our own body in our own gut we have our own asses to do that cross microfiltration is a process that uses cold cold temperatures to split the fractions into their into their parts this again if you want to go down the road of not denaturing your protein this is what this is high highend crustal microfiltration will not denat the proteins cuz it won heat other processes that I haven covered here will expose them to high heat and that could break down the proteins but again it breaks down the proteins and causes a breakdown of a lot of these other important fractions like I talked about like the lactoferrin that would be why you would want to eliminate the chemical and the uh high heat conditions but from a standpoint of the value of the protein itself it going to have a high value in terms of building muscle but I I like to think again with athl X it building muscle it whole better you well that to worry about the the the benefits that we do want to preserve here of the immune boosting so ion exchange again cross microfiltration is the way that the isolate is further prepared same thing with the um the hydroly protein all at all what do that mean to you guys it should just mean that when you looking for your protein determine what it is you lactose intolerance you got to start looking right here at the isolate if you probably can get away with the concentrate you good immune boosting effects again me I like the I like the combination of the speed of Entry of isolate I like the fact that we can prepare it with a cold process across from microfiltration to get you guys the highest quality and Purity in the protein and I like the fact that again it has all of these important immune boosting agents intact as well so that guys if you haven already tried is how we develop our athl RX supplements we choose the highest quality proteins we choose the highest quality ingredients we get you guys none of the fluff none of the filler none of that crap to make sure that the uh the stuff that we deliver to you at the end of the day is the best product that you can possibly use if you haven guys head to athlin ars.com to see what it is that we supplement line expanding every day uh to meet the demands of what you guys want and need in the meantime if you found this video in this 101 helpful make sure you leave a thumbs up below and some comments and if you want me to continue to do more of this nutritional breakdown I know what it is you want me to cover all right guys I soon	Success
The Supplement Timeline (What Age - Which Supplements!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhK0kyJj00s	ATHLEAN - X	what athletex.com a couple weeks ago i did a video where i opened up my vitamin cabinet i showed you all the vitamins and the supplements that i take on a daily basis well that video sparked a lot of follow-up questions and mostly in relation to not just supplementation but training and where it fits in on a timeline from an age factor when should you start working out when should you start taking certain supplements what is it appropriate to do each so i thought why don follow-up video that discussed i it the supplement timeline that discusses the major categories of supplements when i feel across one to take something and we workouts too we might as well address the workouts right off the bat people ask me jeff when is it appropriate for my son to start lifting weights i don recommend in this first age bracket 10 to 13 years or years older obviously less than that that anybody starts training with weights i do think that exercise and training is great at any age even kids under 10 years old training is actually accomplished in a form of play you watch a kid outside and they lunges lunges they when they jump up on rocks they a lot of different movements that we doing in the gym that we something else and they just call it playing that builds body awareness it builds coordination it builds baseline strength well in this 10 to 13 age bracket don get them into weights they don do that most often i find that kids are still pretty uncoordinated at that age and they need to be learn how to control their own body so body weight training programs resistance bands all good weights not really necessary until you start hitting your teenage years and then from there becomes really easy ways all the way through the rest of your life all the way up into your 80s you can continue to lift weights and build muscle long long into your older years if you keep pushing yourself in your workouts you might have to dial back a little bit on the intensity that you have when you relative to how you feel in your 70s and 80s you should still continue to give it your best and still continue to try to build muscle and build strength because results and research has proven that you can still do it you can still do it maybe not as easy as you did back here in these formative years but you can do it so supplementation now where does that fit in well we broke it down into these four major age brackets 10 to 13 year olds again we don saying there supplementation prior to that you what my answer is here too 14 to 19 year olds so your teenage years 20 to 39 so just basically your your middle years 20 20s and 30s then we just go 40 and up okay we can probably break it down another age bracket a little bit higher especially for specialty vitamins but what are the categories here multi a multivitamin specialty vitamins pre-workouts protein powders and meal replacement powders branched-chain amino acids creatine joint recovery formulas and high-grade omega-3s now all of these are ones that basically made up that vitamin cabinet video of mine now if you haven the video it it for a long time jeff what is it that you exactly take every single day i break it down literally a bottle of my bottle what it is so this will look familiar to those of you that watch that video as far as the age brackets and the appropriateness of it i believe that a multivitamin is appropriate for all age brackets now is it there or not they at it as an insurance policy i think that in this age bracket for sure and everything else really but right here your nutrition better be in place and i blame it on the parents a lot of times but that by the age of 10 to 13 if your kids are still eating a bunch of crap because you thought it was cute when they were four five six seven eight years old you gotta start teaching them habits here because this is when childhood obesity really starts to rise because they haven and they changing their bodies pretty soon because of puberty if you don them here you problems going forward so baseline nutrition nutrition should take up 98 percent of everything here a multivitamin yeah maybe for some insurance and specialty vitamins there are some conditions that could be benefited by taking some specialty vitamins like a vitamin d or like some vitamin u b6 or b12 that might be appropriate for somebody in this category so specialty vitamins might work again same thing here i think the reason in the 14 to 19 year old a few more specialty vitamins to again start not only teaching the responsibility of addressing some of your nutritional needs through supplementation making that making there be an awareness that maybe i getting everything through my diet because i still don perfect but i might need to address some of my in insufficiencies through supplementation so specialty vitamins a good thing i think here and of course through the rest of life as well as you saw i had a bunch of them in my video now we get to this big group of stuff that i talk about as sort of performance enhancing uh supplements i don committed to eating well and this is a very important point for this video if you are committed to a diet that consists of ding dongs uh twinkies fried foods cakes um candy all that all that you don discussion because thinking that taking supplements is going to get you to where you want to be when you get the rest of your diet in check is the biggest pipe dream out there and the people that want to make you think that that out there and we know we don supplements if you following a proper nutrition plan i mean a healthy nutrition plan doesn be perfect we talked about that too but start having a commitment to eating better because you truly are what you eat if you think you all through supplementation you wrong but if the guys who are watching my my videos like most of them are out there they they they they look good in the right light but they you know they when they the you know the lights are all on them they don you can start really fine tuning and helping yourself through supplementation because it makes the job of getting nutrition right that much easier it allows for the consistency that to see results over time from your nutrition and i think that part about supplementation so pre-workouts my feeling on pre-workout certainly not here these guys are out for the rest of the way there else i would recommend for them here in the teenage years yes we know athletes especially they pre-workouts just be careful about the pre-workouts that you like i showed you my athlete rx1 we went to great lengths to make sure that we did not include any of the banned substances we went for nsf approval for sport because we don ourselves to any of the scrutiny that comes from putting banned substances in our products just like the videos that i did on end about uh 1 3 dimethylamine we were out of it from the very beginning we never we we knew that was a bad ingredient from the very beginning we stayed away from it some manufacturers have not some have replaced it with new dangerous ingredients and they willing to do whatever it takes to get you to take them and feel like your heart we on the other hand go for a lot more of a consistent safe energy so one that one that energy we know that athletes are taking them again i think it goals if you like you need them to get up for your workouts or need them to get up for your your games then we know they take them of course it here as well same the guys will take them based on preference protein and meal replacement powders again i think protein powders are a staple of a good supplementation plan if it about in plenty other videos the differences in proteins and what makes a high grade protein a good protein if you think they that you can tell you that in my teenage years i was taking meal replacement powders as one of my after school meals to make sure that i wasn it was far too easy for me to go grab the enemas chocolate chip cookies instead of having a protein shake but when i started to become more committed to what i was doing the protein shake become a lot became very easy for me to do i said goodbye to the cookies and i said hello to my abs for the first time in my life so protein powders now branched in amino acids we talked i going to kind of group these together breast amino acids and creatine i think i am i am a big believer in the benefits of creatine i think that creatine is one of the most well researched uh supplements performance enhancing supplements that are out there that you cannot get in adequate amounts no matter what anybody says through diet alone because what happens when you to get it in the amounts you need to get it to have this it you meat that could cause other problems by having the amounts that you eat to get just the creatine alone so why not go if you ergogenic aids of the creatine why not just supplement with creatine well we like pre-alkaline more than we like creatine because of its less acidic state because of its ability to be taken without cycling on and off creatine we and because of its lack of conversion to creatinine we can actually do this more effectively with the branched-chain amino acids with our protein powder we do that with rx2 again that was why i showcased my rx2 as what i take again you can take your own supplements guys this is not a take my supplements and that your own research i our research and we combined the benefits of all three and i think it appropriate again for all three age groups especially those are looking for the convenience of making sure they have enough muscle building protein high grade in their in their diets supported by brainstem amino acids and also supported by creatine which we feel in the form of pre-alkaline in one formula just makes it a lot easier than having to have six different bottles or or or four different bottles here joint recovery and high grade omega-3s the last two that we had talked about again in the video dr sees omega-3s was the one that my father developed back 30 years ago this i had the benefits of now for a very long time again growing up with my dad who was making it and joint mechanics athlete rx mechanics this is our new joint recovery formula this i wish i had a lot longer a lot a lot longer ago because you guys probably know my history if you watch the videos bad knees a bad shoulder the shoulder didn have been a problem for a long time i feel like if you you i by training hard i mean you regular gym goer you your training you weight you the time those guys are serious then those guys should certainly be be taking joint recovery and muscle recovery the inflammatory anti-inflammatory properties of high-grade omega-3s in your in your teens and in your 20s specifically in your 20s here again me personally and this is my opinion i would have been taking both i was taking the omega-3s i would have been taking the joint recovery formula as a proactive step to help me not be in the situation i am now because a lot of the damage i did was from high school sports i had been taking a joint recovery when i felt no pain back then it would have been a better situation i think for me now than i am you know had i taken it so there i again it not you take them in those years but if you athletically or if you yourself in the weight room i would definitely take it here 20 to 39 years old definitely i think that these are totally appropriate here even if you not feeling joint discomfort at the moment because if you continue to work out for long enough you guys probably know there right now matter of fact i know there probably one joint somewhere that aches you or causes you some discomfort a lot of times from the results of your training you can okay and then again 40 and up for sure i think guys here it they already have issues they feeling the discomforts from their daily life that makes them look for joint recovery formulas and high grade omega-3s but again i think here it better uh chance for you to get in on this proactively especially if you athlete so here cabinet of mine once again broken down into major categories this is sort of this timeline i wanted to put together to answer that question for you a little bit more specifically about what is appropriate and what isn appropriate one thing you did not see on here you did not see any pro hormones you did not see any testosterone replacement supplements you did not see any of that garbage guys those that i steered away from for a long time and going back to when mark maguire would have his anderstein dial in sitting up in his locker which essentially became a smokescreen for what was really going on those supplements just aren anybody that will sell those to you also i i i just uh we same page that and morally we would steer you guys away from that you don need are the basics here and then the commitment to proper nutrition okay if you a commitment and you a commitment to proper nutrition you can do that guys i lay out the athlean x factor meal plan for you it commitment to proper nutrition there no gimmicks there there real food i give you real easy ways to do it i don chef to learn all new recipes it doable and if it followable and if you can follow it you can become consistent with it and that is the key as far as supplementation guys as i showed you in the last video everything that i take is what i recommend to you i would never recommend something to you that i don take myself or that i can vouch for myself and of course that why we made the athlean rx supplements rx1 is the pre-workout rx3 is our night time protein recovery which falls into our protein powders and of course our rx2 is our pro post workout that has branched in amino acids and uh kre alkaline in it as well you can get all those guys at athlean rx if you looking to take exactly what i but the bottom line is commit to good nutrition become consistent stay away from the garbage right and stick to a plan and you will definitely see results from your supplementation i hope this video was helpful i hope it broke down and gave you guys some ideas yes it feel like we needed to cover everything all right guys we in the next couple of days make sure you leave your comments below your thumbs up and let me know whatever else you want me to see that you want me to cover i cover if there supplementation specifically let me know below maybe we here in the upcoming weeks all right guys we	Success
Workout Supplement and Vitamins (Jeff CavaliereÂs Exact Plan)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TK7iVTo5u1A	ATHLEAN - X	what going to take you behind the scenes today we one of the questions is Jeff what do you take for your supplementation what are you exactly taking from morning until night well I figured I cabinets for you and I you why that second we but I actually take my vitamins and I going to tell you where I take them through throughout the day and why and then I have my workout supplementation as well a lot of you guys will probably have something that looks somewhat similar to this and that bottles now I take a lot of these things for a lot of different reasons some of which are insurance policy because I can tell you guys that even though I eat extremely healthy and I I there I still feel there things that I and if I can take them in supplemental form they act as an insurance policy for me now that being said there things that I don when it comes to workout nutrition that you from them unless you You creatin in your diet from eating Foods alone especially not on a consistent basis so there ingredients that will be much more beneficial to you in supplemental form but let here I kind of have my my fatty acids and again I take omega-6 fatty acids in the form of evening primrose oil and I take my highgrade omega-3 fatty acids now the Omega 6 some guys would say Jeff why would you even bother taking Omega 6 we know that in large amounts Omega 6es can actually be inflammatory as opposed to anti-inflammatory well if you had a diet that was the typical diet based on high uh sources of vegetable oil or from highly processed foods using vegetable oil that might be the case I don any of that crap I eat such a low a low processed food diet that I don have a high am amount of Omega 6es floating around and also the Omega 6es are highly stored in body fat again I don so I tend to need a little bit of supplemental Omega 6es and of course I balance that out because the ratio is very important with my Omega-3s and I take three a day of the Omega-3s and this is a pharmaceutical grade omega-3 this is a uh my father omega-3 that we sell at aex.com I sell these because I have have more experience with this as you can imagine than any in my life I years my father is a physician for those of you guys that don a pharmaceutical grade EPA DHA concentration of omega-3 fatty acids and this is exactly what I take I believe in it so much obviously that I actually even give it to my dogs I have it lined up usually right over there next to their food which by the way anybody since this is behind the- scenes video who formula is there that is my dog Darla she idea is again I recommend to you and my family only the things I would take myself so we take the Omega-3s then I have sort of this array of antioxidants for a lot of different purposes I have vitamin C 5500 milligrams that I take once a day now I antioxidant of taking vitamin C of having too much because it soluble V vitamin you know whatever I not going to use I eliminate and pee out so I concerned here but again insurance policy vitamin E same thing a lot of guys out there who are watching probably take vitamin C and vitamin E but again this is a fat cable vitamin so you have to be careful that you taking Mega dosages for me it a day uh a thousand IUS of vitamin E CoQ10 another naturally occurring substance in our in every cell of our body I take it as an insurance policy it has shown uh good protective health benefits for men especially cardiac and then we have my green tea extract which is again kind of a a TW it serves as both a antioxidant but it also has been shown to have an effect on blood sugar stability and you guys know that even my eating plan really revolves around the importance of blood sugar stability we intermittent fasting it that I don pattern of eating can help you in losing fat but it pattern if you want to stabilize your blood sugars which I think over the course of the day and especially from over the long run is a very important thing to do so I take that in addition to eating the way I do uh and of course the ultimate in the backup plan a multivitamin you know I think it to take a multivitamin for a lot of the micronutrients that maybe if you have some sort of extremism to your diet you might be missing finally from The Joint recovery side of things I developed mechanics and this is our first NSF approved for sport uh supplement that we have now being used by by MLB this upcoming season because joint recovery I think is the most overlooked element of recovery when it comes to training that there is we worry about our supp we worry about our muscles and again from Dr C recovery I I description below that you want to read over on our blog about the benefits of Omega-3s as a Muscle Recovery Agent for from The Joint side of things we have to make sure that we have that cover too and this is my absolute best effort to do that and myself I can totally vouch for it anybody that knows my history knows I had bad shoulder pains as I addressed in the video I think last week and I had bad knee pains my leg workout suffered for a long period of time but as you saw even the last leg workout that I did I can substantially lift a lot more weight now my knees have never felt better and I can totally uh pin that to me beginning my athlean Rx so anybody out there that thinking about the fact that it no pain equals more gain in my opinion you can get much more benefits if you training without pain and then it comes to workout nutrition when it comes to workout nutrition guys it really simple I think you need to keep it simple in that a lot of times you see the same sort of array of of a 100 bottles when it comes to workout nutrition creatin glutamine Branan amino acids protein powder whey protein casum protein it doesn guys when we created the athlan RX supplement series which again the exact same supplements that I take everything here is exactly what I take this is my pre-workout I take it 30 minutes before I work out this is athlan RX1 the important thing about it is no crash no dangerous ingredients none of that uh the the artificial highs that you get by taking some of those ingredients that have since a been banned or are just simply not the right amounts to be dosing people with we get the sustained energy without all the the extreme highs and lows this is what makes it so effective and anybody that has taken RX1 can bouge for that for me Muscle Recovery starts right after you train and we have the athl rx2 which is athl accelerate this is our Kickstart to the muscle recovery process we get the right nutrition in we deliver creatin in the form of crealine into your body at the time it needs it most which I feel is right after you train and we do so in a complete formula our bran acid are in here our whey protein is in here everything is in the one formula it just makes it a lot simpler I think and then finally probably the most overlooked of all elements is Muscle Recovery right before you go to bed if you think that you can just go to bed and a lot of times having the last time eight around six or 7 o such an opportunity to provide your body with the nutrition it needs while it needs it the most which is when you recovering and repairing muscle all of your Muscle Recovery guys repairs 90% of it occurs while you sleeping it regenerates it restructures itself from the damage that you did and hopefully the good damage that you did in the in your workout earlier that day if you it with the nutrition it needs then you opportunity that never go to bed a single night without taking rx3 so the idea here guys is giving you a peak into exactly what I take this is it now again it might be a little bit daunting to some of you guys or you might have a lot of it covered yourself but for me it works and this is the the exact sort of stepbystep approach that I take and I will tell you one big step consistency if you want to get the most out of your supplementation be consistent Above All Else these vitamins that I order here these vitamins this brand this particular brand was introduced to me by my grandmother 25 years ago and I ordering the same kind for 25 years and I I like how I feel I could just base it on that I like how I feel I think I look the way I want to look uh I feel good every day so I keep taking it and I stay very very consistent like I said this cabinet up here these are backups so that when I run out of these I can stay consistent I prepare so if you want to make sure that you really have your supplementation down be prepared get your supplements ahead of time make sure you have a steady AR a steady stock of them so that you your results coming and to keep your your uh your consistent approach not just in the gym but obviously here in the kitchen as well guys if you found this video helpful which I hope you have again you long time make sure you leave your comments and your thumbs up below what are you guys taking fill in the blanks what else do you like to take in addition to what I what you think why you take it what you think it works and uh or why it it works for you and uh that discussion we can start below but in the meantime guys hopefully you found this helpful any of these again Dr sees mechanics the RX

Why Mass Gainer Supplements Suck at Building Muscle (BIG TIME!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CfFSUUS8HM	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what we that seems to never go away it comes up each and every day here and it that I know very well having lived through it painfully lived through it myself back in my teenage years and that is the subject of mass gainers and weight gainers is there any value to these things in helping guys painfully skinny guys to build muscle put on Mass so on and so forth I can tell you this first and foremost we should not even begin this discussion if there reluctance on your part to commit to a solid nutrition program I before in all my videos regarding supplementation and I for those that this might be the first time you reluctance to commit to a solid nutrition plan then don about supplementation or anybody for that matter and certainly don anybody else ours and I as I possibly can yet realizing that that will cost sales there talk about supplementation if you have a reluctance to have a solid nutrition program and and commit to eating the right foods high quality nutrient-dense foods now does that mean it has to be boring Foods no there to have a a a a meal plan that actually tastes good and there obviously watching this channel who are already at that point their nutrition is better than most and they to making it better and better as they can those guys can start to you know investigate supplementation to supplement their nutrition regimen however if you there I was totally there I ate the worst diet as I possibly could as a teenage kid and guess what I looked for I looked for the solution in a bottle the first gym I ever stepped into the guy told me God you need to take a way Gainer so the first thing I did was I grabbed my grandmother we went to the store and I went out and I bought a w canner and my problem was I didn was weed or 18 00 thinking that that was going to you know do something for me because it didn went back and I bought the weer 2700 I taking 2700 calories now why didn work here the the question because there age-old adage that says horeshit in equals horseshit out and what I was putting in my body was 100% pure horseshit and anybody out there that sells a weight gainer and Advocates a weight gainer and I calorie weight gainers that that thing that a skinny guy needs to put on weight and size is flat out delivering nothing but poor [\\xa0__\\xa0] to you so what do we do about it I think the first thing we have to do is we have to realize it not about the calories it the calories ultimately the calories will matter but it calories and stuffing in as many calories as you can because if you stuff in as many calories as you can but you then you whole equation of horseshit in equals horseshit out you need to give your body high quality calories if you expect it to help you to build high quality muscle high quality uh metabolically demanding lean muscle tissue it your body to help you add lean muscle that muscle has to be sustained there a price to pay for that muscle it going to let you just add it whenever you want by taking in SAR nutrition and slamming down uh thousands and thousands thousand calories of of subpar Uh crap what you guys is you things sub quality protein and tons of sugar and in both of those guys you don essential nutrition that you need to help build new lean muscle here the tip offs that you should know if you can go through the wal the aisles of Walmart and find your weight gainer that you that that you need to take and be able to get it at an affordable price and find that on the label not only are they giving you all these carbohydrates sugar but they in Mass amounts as well 40 gram 50 gram but it costs 20 30 bucks 40 bucks I can tell you right now you nothing but crap you can that it does if it quality protein but high quality protein doesn even think about your Sal solid food options steaks are not cheap fish is not cheap even cheese and and milk on a on a a per weight basis is not cheap so high quality proteins are not inexpensive however these weight gainers these Mass gainers are filled with lowquality proteins that come at a cheap price I think that disservice than anything else because what happens is the guy the painfully skinny guy who answer goes to the weight gainer takes in 2500 calories is told he should have 3,500 4500 calories in a day he thinks he he meanwhile he nutrition to back it up meanwhile he thinks he number he 3500 4,000 whatever that number may be he go wrong that want to do that to think it has to start with your solid nutrition and then again supplement and if you again high quality is the only way to go I have my athl Rx line of supplements you guys know I talk about the quality of our supplementation does it come cheap no it does not it never will it never will I can nutrition that we do at a cheap price because it doesn protein doesn now is it for everybody no it cater to professional athletes guys our supplements are used by professional athletes it single guy can have but does it mean that you luck no start with a solid nutrition plan I ate peanut butter and banana sandwiches for the longest time again after I already realized that the weight gainers were doing nothing for me and I started to actually see some benefits is that the perfect sandwich no but at least it quality protein some uh some high quality fats unsaturated fats I get some carbohydrates at least not from pure sugar but from from uh uh banana right and I was on my way and I made some adjustments along the way I kind of continue to fine- tune my nutrition in my diet plan I got more and more committed and then of course when I got to that point where I really was locked in on my nutrition then I look for supplementation and I got that extra Edge like I said a lot of guys watching this channel are already at that point they know they their nutrition look looking for that extra Edge that can come but do not make the mistake of thinking that your answers are in a bottle number one especially if you can and two don revolves around calories calories alone low quality calories won won important Gap to building new muscle all they with a bunch of useless calories that your body can you metabolism to burn through it you may not get fat if you gainers is become a fat Gainer so guys hopefully this shed a little bit of light on an important topic again I passionate about it because I lived it and I made the mistake myself I took all of them and every single one of them did nothing for me but when I made my commitment to stop eating a bunch of [\\xa0__\\xa0] and take that one step at a time improve my breakfast start to improve my uh lunch start to improve my my dinner I couldn every meal I just wasn started to eat more frequently not only does that help you with stabilizing your blood sugar but it allows you to get in some additional calories as you go but only if you high quality calories if it to be high quality forget it all entirely so guys if you found this video helpful make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up Below in the meantime if you quality protein if it then I would strongly recommend it to you head to athl rx.com and check out our athl RX supplement line again used by top professional athletes worldwide in the meantime guys I will be back here in just a couple days to bring you back some other videos we got another watch for Wednesday coming up this week and then whatever else this you want to see make sure you leave it down below

Which Form of Creatine is Best (NOT MONOHYDRATE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YWm4LyW32c	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what today I want to talk to you about creatin and no not about whether or not creatin is actually a good supplement because by now you should understand that it is probably one of the most well- researched science-backed supplements that you can take both for its safety and its efficacy the in the the interesting thing though is there a lot of different forms of creatin that cause a lot of confusion and people really want to know what is the best form of creatin to take so I wanted to cover that especially considering the fact that in our athl RX supplement line we do not use standard creatin monohydrate and it reasons I think so I wanted to at least give you guys those the The Clarity on that in terms of our RX1 we have a form of creatin called creatin hydrochloride and in our post-workout rx2 we have crealine now both of these as opposed to a cream monohydrate are bonded forms of creatin some molecule is bound to the creatin to cause an effect to cause a change versus the regular creatin monohydrate in the hydrochloride the hydrochloride is Bond and what it does is it actually lowers the pH of that substance so the now becomes a lower more acidic compound that good thing because what it it does actually is it increases the the absorbability and its ability to be absorbed in your intestines and also to be sort of mixed well you when when when you mix creat Amah hydrate a lot of times it sinks right to the bottom and it looks like sand on the bottom that what actually winds up happening and a lot of people when they take creat monohydrate that same sediment winds up making its way into your intestines and trying to be absorbed you know calling in more water to try to help with that absorption which winds up bloating you and giving you that bloated feeling if you regular cre monohydrate with the crean hydroch chloride because you that and you to absorb more of it you able to take a lower dose so it has a second benefit to you you don load with 20 G anymore and you don have to maintain dosages of 5 gram anymore you could do it with a lot less about 2 gam of a creatin of a creatin hydroch chloride is going to be equivalent to about four gram of creatin monohydrate so that and the third benefit is you getting as much breakdown into something called creatinin which is a byproduct that you don your body but happens because of the ingestion of creatin now the same thing happens here in our post-workout where we have crealine which is another bonded form of creatin again for the very same benefits now the the reason why we use that you grams and four grams based on their increased conversion value so about a total of eight grams between the two and we post-workout there that will argue for both times to take the uh to take creatin you can get it pre-workout to sort of benefit and increase your performance during the workout and then other studies would argue that it your training to to sort of help replenish that but the idea is as long as you in here again with less conversion to creatinin you your body and performance without having the bad uh one thing I when people start looking at the research of whether or not the bonded form of creatin is better than creatin monohydrate you have to understand this one main point they increased power increased strength they nobody ever said that these are going to have give you more power generating benefits than a regular Crea monohydrate it of a creative monohydrate in terms of performance but with all those added benefits I just told you about the the need to not have to cycle on and off some people again will say that you want to cycle because of the build up of creatinin on and off of Crea monohydrate you don getting all those benefits the same level of benefit and performance without having to have that so throw away all those studies that are looking for it to be better than that in terms of performance look at it to be the same in terms of performance but without those other effects so guys I hope you found this to be a little bit enlightening in terms of what it actually does what the difference there lot of other differences in in forms of creatin many many many other forms people doing all new research all the time bonding different molecules to create them to see what kind of an effect it has we research talk and speak for itself as time plays out but for now by far these are what I prefer I think I get much better effect it from my training and those that used our products and I would recommend it if you were looking for uh a way to benefit and maximize your benefits of taking creatin if you looking for our athlet ARX suppl guys you know where to find them they at athl rx.com in the meantime I want to try to continue to put the education back into supplementation you know it not just about taking something blindly it before you do and I hope that our channel can do that let me know what other things you want me to try to cover here in future videos on supplements and I guys we days	Success
Bodybuilding Supplements That Work IF... (SUPPLEMENT LIE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_sx0oHg-go	ATHLEAN - X	is there something floating in your supplements guys there better be especially if you harder money on Branch chain amino acids let me explain to you why [Music] today what athleen x.com today I want to address one of the most popular questions that I get and unfortunately it saddest questions that I get cuz each and every day those that are using our athl RX supplements inevitably somebody writes in and says what is this stuff floating at the top of my RX1 my pre-workout RX1 supplement and it really it makes me it makes me upset because the answer there guys is it supposed to be there and unfortunately it supplements especially those claiming that they acids in so you guys have known how much I industry and how a Down right awful it could be well we know that branchin amino acids are one of the most desirable supplements that we can put in our body right they derivatives of our longer chain proteins we can use them for energy if we include them in our pre-workouts we can use those to increase protein synthesis if taken after our workouts the idea here though is guys are you really getting what you you guys a little experiment and just prove my point I Mr Wizard experiment here to show you we have two supplements here we have my aine RX1 supplement and I took the label off of one of the most popular pre-workouts Branch chain amino acid pre-workouts on the market I am not going to list who that is I to deal with any lawsuits here but I do want you guys to really concentrate on what you see first and for and you can try these experiments on your own supplements trust me you going to find out what I here if we take two things of water here we take a scoop of athlan RX1 pour it in and then we take a scoop of this Branch chin amino acid and we put it in and we stir them okay now I shake these but we them a little bit more just get this off here stir what you should see here guys is unfortunately this popular Branch chinam Mino acid is incredibly clear at the top everything has BL Blended itself together whereas in our RX1 there lot of clumping going out of the top guys the clumping is coming from the fact that Branch chain amino acids in their chemical nature are hydrophobic you cannot change that that means they fear what water they clash with water they separate like oil and water what we want to do is we want to make sure that what we actually in our supplements and you can run this test on your own breast amino acid supplement and find out that yours is mixing incredibly clear and if it starts to taste like a Jolly Rancher I could also tell you that Branch T amino acids have a really bad taste they acidic they obviously so if yours is mixing incredibly clear and taste great you most likely not getting what you paying for and guys as I said before that is the sad thing about the supplement industry you can buy what you think you getting what you think you incredibly up in the air all right so as I say guys you don RX all I tell you though is you have to buy a brand that you trust in and I go to Great Lengths to create a supplement line that I know I can take that I know I can stand behind and be proud of an offer to you guys so that you know what you you guys if you go with who you trust and in this case I hope if you you trust what I deliver to you guys here each and every week whether it be through our coverage of our supplements or whether it be through the coverage of all the things I try to give you in our other videos down in the gym all right so if you haven you come on board athletex and check out our trading programs at aex.com and if you that you know you money what you think you actually are getting what you then I would say check out athleen rx.com and try our supplement bundle all right guys we back here if you found this helpful like I said run your own tests this is not rigged you can take your own test and do your own thing this still has lots of clumpiness in there no matter how much I shake that that going to ever dissolve those things will not dissolve in water all right guys be back here again soon	Success
Protein AMOUNT or Protein TYPE - Build More Muscle With this Answer!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpKaq8TLkyw	ATHLEAN - X	we all know how important protein is when it comes to building muscle but not knowing the difference between the types of protein can mean a lot of wasted dollars and a lot of wasted effort in the [Music] gym what x.com I wanted to go over something important today with you guys and it was something really really basic it protein now as I mentioned in the open we all know how important protein is when it comes to building muscle but there are different types and sources of protein that can make a big big difference depending upon where you going to get your protein each and every day so really what I want to do is just break it down for you and show you why so you understand what this all means when it talks about good sources of protein versus maybe not the best sources of protein first and forem most we have two main sources we can go to animal and vegetarian or vegetable sources in our animal sources you know all the main culprits here meat beef poultry like chicken and turkey fish anything animal derived milk eggs yogurt or pork right we know those I tell you the main difference between that in a second next though vegetables we have legumes or beans grains like wheat nut Butters peanut butter things like that seeds or nuts themselves okay but the main difference here is that vegetarians often have a hard time getting enough protein because the vegetarian sources are incomplete protein now what do I mean by that a complete protein is one that has all nine of the essential amino acids that our body needs in the right proportion so what are those non amino acids let me see if I can think back to my chemistry days but we have one called thine then we have uh histadine lysine our Branch to amino acids veine Lucine isoline what I got three more methionine with cine phenyalanine and torine and number nine 3des uh tryptophan that goes way back in chemistry school right there for me to remember that but anyway here point a complete protein has all these things in equal in in the amounts that they need to be in order to serve as a complete protein so all those meat sources all those all those nonvegetarian sources they all have these in those amounts so now the the next thing we how bioavailable it is and how digestible it is that argument but for now the problem is our vegetarian sources don incomplete they have certain things like a lot of times your grains will be high in methionine here but they Lucine or low in lysine okay so what we have to do is combine them so you can take an incomplete protein and you can make a complete protein based on the combining of these so now you can take a uh a grain which again is a high highing like rice and combine it with beans and the beans are going to have and pick up the slack of the Lucine that the the grain may not have same thing again peanut butter and uh on a whole wheat on a whole wheat bread the whole wheat will be high in methionine but low in these two but your peanut butter will be able to pick up the slack here and may not necessarily be so high here so this whole thing about food combining and and combining even vegetarian sources of protein we do that in the in the extractor meal plans an athl X I don want you to have to think about all this because it can become confusing and you can be left with an insufficient supply of protein because you wrong choices or you proteins that are high in methionine two grains but you something that in the other elements especially the branch chain amino acid here to be able to pick up the slack all right so all that kind of shows you that yes you can get complete proteins in your diet and most likely it animal Source but you can make it a hell of a lot easier if sometimes you rely on some of the things that we know are complete proteins that are easy to find and a lot of times that is our supplement so if you look at our list over here we have pdcaa a protein digestibility um something of amino acids it change they did a scale here you can look this up though PCA a s and basically it shows you what the highest bioavailability is of a protein and right at the top of the list here you have casin which we do include in athlean rx3 which is reconstruction you have egg whites which are always a staple of what we do a lot of times I recommend them as part of the athl xfactor meal plans scramble egg whites in the morning with salsa okay soy protein we know again it protein not so great for guys but again again it is it is up there whey protein we all know whey protein how important that can be whey protein is on this list again as a 1.0 which is the highest it can be in terms of digestibility and availability and then you beef you that fall below black beans peanuts whole wheat bread brown rice brown rice is at 0 40 you know compared to again these these whey protein sources here so again in underscores if we combine the brown rice at 0 40 with our black beans at 75 it gives us a complete protein it adds up and it and it and it becomes actually digestible in in in available source of protein so what I trying to show you here is that sometimes relying on our way proteins are relying on our casin proteins can be a big big help to trying to get the most protein in during the day without having to worry about all the science behind combining these things together so wherever it is guys whatever it is that you rely on whether it be supplements whether it be athlan RX or whether it be even just through your diet just make sure you have a good understanding and a good grasp the difference between your animal sources of protein and your vegetable sources of protein and if you it all because in the end that really matters the most guys if you haven athleen if you don chemist if you don worry about anything I just said or pronounce even a single word what I just said you can get it all laid out for you already in the athlan xfactor meal plans is 90 days of everything that you need to know uh from start to finish literally meal by meal guys it is uh it is getting close to Summer here as I always say in these videos now I think I try to underscore if you want to look good A lot of it happens with what you do in the gym here but also what you do in the kitchen behind the plate you better eat right if you want to look right and that together here for you so come on board team athleen be back here again next week with another video thanks again guys see you soon he [Music]	Success
Workout Supplement CHEAT SHEET! - WHEN and HOW to Take Your Supplements	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyK2vUMJgtA	ATHLEAN - X	are you feeling as if you getting everything you want out of your supplements it could be not what the bottle but what you [Music] with what athleanx.com as I mentioned in the open if you are a supplement user and you not getting the results from your supplements that you may have thought you should it may not necessarily be what it as I mentioned a few weeks back I covered in depth my athlete RX supplements I also tried to show you guys that the supplement industry can be a tricky one to say it kindly now this is not about pushing the athl RX supplements on you you are free to take anything that you feel works best for you I guys to do what works for you however all I can do is tell you that the research and the science that went into the creation of these three supplements is what makes me as confident and wanting to recommend them to you because I feel like they the best that you can possibly get that is why I make these videos but the good thing about this video is it what about again what we with so as we covered here guys three supplements for me is what you we really sort of talking about in terms of categories a pre-workout supplement a post-workout supplement and the one that most people seem to forget or Overlook that I think is just as important as these two is our overnight recovery supplement overnight is when you repair muscle and repair and and and uh experience regrowth because of what you the stage of recovery three options for mixing generally we have milk it could be nonfat or whole milk juice or water so what I did was I figured let me put together a little chart to show you each one of the work the the supplement C atories pre-workout post-workout and overnight recovery and then the things you can mix them with so let look at that chart all right so on this chart here guys what you I said down the side here pre-workout post-workout and Recovery the mixer up here water juice skim milk home milk I know you guys St Patrick not on this list okay these four categories now when we pre-workout for me the Clear Choice is water why because we want to hydrate pre-workout we want to make sure that we are not dehydrated at any point in the workout especially if your pre-workout has caffeine in it we want to make sure that we are providing adequate hydration so we do have other options here for hydration but if we move to the far end of the spectrum milk is not going to be that great of a choice sure you can do it I said but I don have mixed most pre-workout supplements with milk they taste like crap it really meant to be there it should be more in a watery consistency that I go with water whole milk actually it no no why because when we add the fat in from whole milk we slow a slow emptying of the Pre-Workout into your system so that actually delay the effects that you trying to get from the supplement in the first place and it interfere with blood flow to your muscles when you need that the most during your workout so even if you hard Gainer whole milk not the time for your pre-workout as far as juice goes you have to be careful here because with juice you can actually overload carbohydrates actually interfere with the the uh with the release of the carbohydrates to your muscles sort of the way we try to do with excite is to stagger them to give you the uh carbohydrates in both slow and then more rapidly digestible form so that you get a more sustained energy release if you overload on your on your carbohydrates in your pre-workout you can overload and overdo that interfere with that effect and also give yourself cramps or some you know gastric dis you know discomfort so not what you especially as you competition moving on we to the post-workout category and I think this is the most interesting because one thing that everybody talks about is you got to load up on your carbs after your workout and I actually disagree with that advice when we post workout we want to make sure we have one thing primarily and that protein see when we get finished working out we actually have an increase in insulin sensitivity now I insulin levels guys I insulin sensitivity because there big differences there insulin levels if you increase your insulin levels which you overload on on on sugar after your workout you decrease your growth hormone secretion and igf1 which is another growth factor that and also if you looking to burn some fat if you take in your glucose or your high you know your high sugar car after your workout you actually going to interfere with the normal fat oxidation that was going on after your workout you actually turn that process off so it the amount of carbohydrates that you ingest after your workout if you going to try to get the most muscle building and simultaneously fat burning effort so for me we look at this category now we say no which is shocking to some but we say no we say no again to the fat and the mil and the whole milk because we don absorption again in this post workout window which leaves us with two options here we have water or skin milk I make two notes Here guys yes if it within your post-workout window for water or yes if it milk why is that skin milk actually can conglomerate or glomerate with the uh whey protein in your post-workout so that will actually slow down the digestion of your whey protein in the absorption so if it post-workout window so you just just finished your workout and you want to get the best benefits of your weight protein it slowed down a little bit with the mixing with the milk because you still have that window time frame to be able to absorb that if it hour hour and 15 minutes after you done work you know you completed your workout you might want to get that in a little bit sooner and benefit from the the fast absorption of the way so in that case I would probably mix it with water moving on that final category that I mentioned before for overnight recovery now again same for option guys water skin milk I mean juice skin milk and whole milk this ironically is a point in time where your whole milk especially if you if you out and still you know gain muscle but get to lean at the same time I wouldn recommend it but if you put on some muscle and you need to put on size cuz you the time when it works the best because what the extra fat does is it actually does a couple things number one it digestion again like which was the reason why we didn overnight so you prolonged release of what you put in your body so that helps now the other thing it does is it actually has a protein sparing effect so that we can preferably use the uh triglycerides in the fat for energy you know preferred source of fuel as we overnight to allow the protein to be used more for synthesis and regrowth so in that sense it works it in rx3 we in we include medium chain triglycerides for that very reason to try to allow for those benefits now if you look at the other options here water water is great if especially for a nighttime if you weight again if you lean because it I prefer skin milk because I like the added benefit here you protein which means you rx3 and that has both casin protein and whey protein in it if you protein and you mix in that with milk you casin as well so you bit of the benefit of the combined protein again I like that dual onew punch because you immediate effects of whey protein you getting the more delayed effects from the casin protein we don to talk about juice too much here guys all that Sugar prior to bed when you don to be L doing nothing but laying down you know doing nothing but dreaming you don help you just to get fat so what we don that everything guys in terms of what you should be putting in your body and what you should be mixing it with all right guys so there you have it hopefully a bit more clarity on the things that you should be mixing your supplements with if you still have questions about what you actually should be taking though guys again again I recommend that you check out the athlan RX supplements as I said before you can put in your body whatever it is that you feel is working best for you but if you haven the athl AR supplements yet then I don think you really have that answer guys the athl AR supplements as I said in here they we included the science behind the nutrition even the things that we mentioned in here the importance for not going so carb Heavy after our workouts we have a low car post-workout the inclusion of fats at your nighttime recovery and why that are in here too but it things combined guys that I feel makes these as good as they possibly are again I always say it need exactly when you need it and that was what athl ARS was supposed to be about creating everything just what you need and avoiding all the crap that you don over to athleanx.com go check out and join me on team athleen and if you haven rxment stack guys I encourage you to give it a shot as again your choice not me forcing it on you just recommending what I feel is going to benefit you guys the most as I do here each and every week I another workout video in the meantime leave your comment below let me know if this little chart helps you in making your decisions on what you should be mixing your supplements with I you guys back here in 7 days [Music] a [Music]	Success
Most Important Supplement Category (OVERLOOKED!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig-CVfUciLA	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what x.com here I am baseball winter meetings 2015 in Nashville Tennessee and I with affle RX here getting it to our Major League athletes because there one very important component whether or not you play baseball for a living or you don unassisted lifter you need the help if you recovery Muscle Recovery joint recovery that background as a physical therapist is obviously in muscles and Joints the first thing we came out with last year provided to some of the top major league baseball teams including four of the 10 baseball MLB playoff teams is our joint mechanics formula a lot of you guys have been using mechanics to address joint inflammation look guys if your joints hurt you we talk about the cycle of pain all the time if your joints hurt what happens you you away from pain if you move away from from the pain guess what happens next now with those compensations you asking muscles and Joints to take on loads from muscles and joints that were ill equipped to handle it before and now you new joints and you get breakdowns other places when those areas break down guess what happens you get more pain there and the cycle continues you got to start intervening here and doing everything you can to try to break that cycle of pain you do that again we do it here with mechanics we do it for all of our athletes this year now excited actually for me this is a good place for me to be to be able to talk about reconstruction again this is our rx3 recovery and Recovery is everything guys remember Muscle Recovery is just is is probably the biggest thing you have as again a natural lifter if you accelerate your gains in the gym because anabolic steroids give us the benefit of being able to recover faster recuperate faster that is their main benefit it pretty much allows us these training capacities that are superum that we don to try to see gains the best gains you can you want to try to do something that allows you to either slow down the breakdown or speed up the growth and what we really focus on the most because we have the most control over it is slowing down the breakdown of the body allowing us to control the inflammation allowing us to control the breakdown of our muscles so that we can compensate and come back bigger and stronger so is supplementation necessary not for everybody again I talk about guys that are so overweight 40% body fat 30% body fat but obviously joint mechanics is something you might want want to consider because of all that excess strain on your joints but you not at the fine-tuning stage of really Muscle Recovery as you much have to get your diet cleaned up and get moving but when you start training and taking it seriously and you start to see better and better results and you start getting dialed in Muscle Recovery becomes very important it becomes very much something you should be focusing on so anyway guys I got to run back into the meetings we got a lot of teams in there that I have to talk to still but I wanted to make sure you guys knew what I was up to and give you a kind of a glimpse into what you should be focusing on if you going to suff and where the direction is going here in 2016 and Beyond it about recovery recovery recovery so we want to make sure you you you want to start putting the uh the science back in your supplementation guys head to athleen rx.com in the meantime just wanted to do a quick little shoot I kind had to be pulled away here I got to go back and talk to some of the teams uh inside but uh I want to bring on location here and get you the video that I promised you each and every weekend let me know what you want to see if you want me to discuss more about supplementation just leave the comments below and I to do that for you all right guys I see you soon [Music]	Success
Jack3d Forced To Switch To New Formula - HERE'S WHY! (it's bad)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuizlXIO2rM	ATHLEAN - X	what what is it about this email that has me so fired up that I had to do a video about it as I said it has to do with supplements and I think in order for me to really have an impact that I want it to have for you guys and I I hope to God you will have the same feeling as I do by the time I set it up with a a few things I can show you on my computer okay so let look at the computer screen as you see here back in 2011 March 26 2011 I did a video about what I called pre-workout poison right and and in my sites clearly in my sites at that point was 13 dimethyl aamine okay and it inclusion in the pre-workout supplements the majority of the pre-workout supplements that were on the market at the time now at that time we were just getting started on creating the athlan RX supplement line and as I told you guys in multiple videos before this one of my main focuses was we wanted to raise the bar on the supplement industry okay little did I know that I was going to have to raise the health bar as well because the when we disc you know we researching exactly every ingredient that would go in our in our three bottles here we wanted to make sure that we were putting not only the most effective and best but make sure that we in here well apparently a lot of other manufacturers didn that because in researching 13 dith as a potential ingredient in our formulas at the time what we found out was pretty disturbing okay so here studies that came across my desk and I know you may not be into the research and I don the numbers but I do want to get across here why the my reaction is what it is and why I might seem a little bit out of character here in this video first and foremost from the journal uh physician Sports Medicine it was a study on the effects of one three di meth and caffeine alone or in combination on heart rate and blood pressure in healthy men and women okay so most people I hope that are taking these supplements are healthy but God forbid the guy that not that healthy when he starts the conclusion here was heart rate right here was unaffected by treatment but blood pressure what were higher with geranium which is the same thing here as uh 13 di meth and it says we report for the first time that acute ingestion of 13 that meth alone or in combination with caffeine results in an increase in SBP which is systolic blood pressure DBP and uh without an increase in heart rate now first and foremost guys when you exercising it increase in heart rate and an increase in blood pressure it biological response an increase in blood pressure with no increase in heart rate is not normal okay it lots of bad problems which leads us to the next study here which I can actually close this one for now and close this the next study use of recreational drug 13 dimethylamine associated with cerebral hemorrhage now I what you guys are really after when you but certainly the guys that were doing this weren experience that but no no worries that like apparently still safe right now we move on to the next one toxicology Journal of Toxicology exposures to dmma again another uh another name for this stuff containing products reported to Texas poison Center this is just in Texas 2010 to 2011 identified and selected factors were examined a total of 56 exposures were found of which 75% were reported during 2011 oxy elite pro was a reported product in 80.4% of the exposures so let frequently reported effects were tacac cardio was rapid heart rate so here they knows what you find nausea and vomiting most common treatments for this dilution food and activated charcoal so unless your post-workout is including I guess charcoal you this research comes across my desk makes me clearly understand that we need to get rid of it first of all but second of all what in the hell is it doing in the pre-workouts on the market if all this research is out there and manufacturers are still doing it and I can tell you why because they were lining their their pockets guys on any pre-workout from Jack 3D and I don gets pissed or not they they had it in both of their products and others I not picking on them though because in this screen that you can see here it wasn list of companies right down here many of which guys you guys are very familiar with and here in it again why were they just sitting around continuing to offer this stuff to you guys and not doing anything about it finally the FDA finally steps in thank God which we were hoping for when I made the video back in 2011 I predicted that this stuff would be taken off the market finally the FDA steps in a year later here sent warning letters to a total of 11 companies advising them that dmma containing products marketed as dietary supplements are illegal and must be taken off the market or reformulated to remove dmma these 11 companies account for most of the dmma products sold in the United States this action was taken to protect consumers and get these products off the shelves as quickly as possible now what does all that mean well guys finally the FDA stepped in and said let already planned on stepping in to try to do something about it again guys I made videos about my supplements in the past this is not about pushing my supplements take them if you want to take them I best supplement line that for many many reasons okay all the research that went into it was for a reason but take take that out of consideration all I is these supplements were created and born out of this type of stuff this type of crap that we find when we look at the supplement industry now the email okay cuz this is the kicker of it all so now the email comes across is my desk you got to come look at this uh computer again so right here into my gmail this is what I see we have an ad from this is a man this is a supplement company that I buy my protein bars from this is a company that I trust and buy myself my protein bar from each and every month here pro in Jack 3D and I right here what it says for Jack 3D it been our number one selling pre-workout supplement for years and now it longer being produced we flavors lemon line and classic fruit punch and what we and we and what we have in stock is it if you want to get your hands on some of the last three Ming bottles you should act fast quantities on these are extremely limited and quickly selling off get it before this original formula is gone forever only $21.95 shop now what the is this guys seriously this is ridiculous When I See This and excuse my language if you guys are offended by that I sorry but you guys know that when I doing these these videos for you I do them with the purpose I try to put either workouts nutrition advice or supplementation advice the best that I can in your hands to let you guys decide okay I try to give you the best that I have to be able to help you guys this is not helping okay it it anybody else that got this email because if if there kid that doesn thinks that he from rush out when you clearly do not have to have that to get the results as anybody that has taken RX1 can tell you you don results you just need to be a little bit more well thought out to have a better supplement period and that so guys again I um again a little bit out of character but this is what supplement industry when this type of email could go out who has really got your back who is really trying to look out for you they this [\\xa0__\\xa0] off their shelves so they can clear it out for the next uh hot ingredient that dangerous years down the road the same way a fedrin was before all right so guys again we week we guys know and love but I had to make this this email or this video because I got this email and it got me kind of worked up and uh as you can see you know a little bit out of character but again I think it has to be said and uh again if if it raise the barless self Ministry I swear the hell I most I can to do the best I can and it starts for us right here all right but I can least I can do is spread the knowledge for you guys all right that done I um get myself ready I out actually try to lower my blood pressure um I will see you guys back here next week uh in the meantime uh stay safe try to stay away from all this junk guys and uh um you know I promise to be a little bit calmer next week all right I back here in 7 days a [Music]	Success
Pre-Workout Ingredient Showdown (WHICH WORKS BEST?)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOgJIuu0qJs	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] what so what should be in your pre-workout allinine or citranet I answer that question for you here in a very simple way today I to get simple even though we have some complex things that happen inside of our bodies that if we can make it simple and understandable then it can actually grasp and gives you a better understanding when you approach supplementation so line let there why do people take it in the first place well the argument is that we were trying to increase nitric oxide and nitric oxide is a vasod dil has a vasod dilating effect in our bodies which will increase the muscle pump and that people will rely on these types of uh ingredients in a pre-workout so we get nitric oxide from here and we get citrine and we do that with an enzyme that have is the citrine can actually be converted back by another enzyme back to allinine this all looks so great but the problem is this is what our bloodstream when the all arginine is in our bloodstream this is what on but guess what we got to get it into the damn bloodstream to start and that the problem because unless we this via intravenously which I hope you hard time getting this to the bloodstream because it has to go through our digestive tract and when it does it goes down a different path it goes down this other path that enters the ARA cycle so here the allinine gets broken down into ornithine which is a amino acid my handwriting sucks I know that and it also gets broken down into Ura which is a waste product the ornithine can actually be converted back into citrine and the citrine can be converted into allinine again but you can see that this isn nitric oxide so what happens is when you take allinine by mouth in a supplement you it matter of fact you studies will show about 30% of what you even if you 10 gram of allinine you winding up with about three grams of it so that matter of fact there was another study that showed guys that have high cholesterol were only maybe retaining up to 1% % 99% wasting of this taken this way so what we kind of counterintuitive what we would think is that the better way to get here is to actually start with the citrine which will convert to L Arginine whether this way or this way which then will become nitric oxide but the thing and the advantage that the citrine has is that it actually bypasses the same metabolic pathway that the allinine kind of got ruined by so it bypasses the digestive tract it bypasses the liver in this way it actually gets to the bloodstream and can have this effect in a much more uh in a much more effective way you 300% increase some studies will show the numbers are all over the place the idea is this guys you of a lot more retained from the citrine to get to the nitric oxide than you would otherwise so the the it doesn even really end there because we talking about citrine here in supplementing with citrine mallate so I haven mallate part and all that is is citrine itself is just a free form when you Bond it to malic acid in its malate form then what we get is citrine malate and what the malic acid does it actually provides a second benefit this benefit is that it feeds something called the kreb cycle and the kreb cycle just think of it this way it energy for your cells especially for your muscular contraction the kreb cycle will produce ATP ATP we know is another good thing to help with creatin so if you more important to be taking cine mate so you effect but you endurance effect as well so you getting more energy more prolonged energy from taking citrine malate versus a plain citrine but clearly in terms of the choice between allinine or citrine malate the citrine is going to win out hands down in the CIT malet of course even more so so lastly I with this two things one on dosing and one on sort why were we even doing this in the first place the idea behind the muscle pump it guys the muscle pump is actually the nitri oxide itself is creating a vasil dilation it that kind of surround our arterial walls to to loosen a little bit so that you get a a larger vessel that will allow more blood to flow through that will go to your working muscles and help you to train at a higher or harder level the idea is also the fact that in your blood since is composed predominantly of water you those muscles as well so that the main benefits it pumped but it nutrients and more water to those working muscles about dosing I this no matter what you better make sure your dosing is proper because what say we science back in supplementation here at athl X I could take an aspirin for a headache that doesn going to work if I take 1/8 of a tablet of aspirin we know that aspirin will work but an eighth of a tablet is not going to do a damn thing if you to benefit from supplementation you better make sure you right dosing the dosing that by research you better be looking for about six to eight gram of citrine mate if you want that dose looking for one gram two grams is not going to give you the effect and the benefits that you looking for from taking C melee in the first place so I hope this cleared up the confusion or any any sort of idea you might have had about the difference between the two some guys don know anything about them before watching this video but now I hope you do if you are looking for supplements that put the science back into supplementation guys I say it all the time here at athl next I try to back up what we do and not just sit here and talk but educate you as to why because I think the more informed you are the better you terms of making the right decision for you our supplements are over at are over at athl rx.com in the meantime if you found this video helpful leave your comments and and thumbs up below and let me know what other things can I cover for you here in these supplement breakdowns what other things that confuse you what would you like me to talk about I that in the days and weeks ahead all right guys I soon here	Success
Protein Myth BUSTED!! (Cooked Protein and Shakes)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tmx9UeGuOvY	ATHLEAN - X	what let most long-standing protein myths in under four minutes athl Express style and that being does applying heat to protein destroy its value does it destroy its muscle building properties in way protein manufacturing is heat when it to completely devalue that protein well let talking about the s of the protein guys you know I like to draw here the source it doesn about whey whether they meat whether they your protein source is going to have protein molecules and allergens now allergen is something that is going to interact with our own body immunoglobulins to produce an immune boosting event unless you to be allergic to that allergen okay that that out of the equation for the second right here you P you take these two molecules you apply heat to them one of two things will happen you either denature that or you coagulate it denaturing is going to be where we change the shape of that molecule and coagulation is going to be where the molecules start to Clump together but what end of the day what shaped protein molecule that here and still intact and a situation where the allergen is either here still or gone now whether it dependent upon the protein source and I loss that you application of heat to the protein might be in the form of one essential amino acid which is lysine because you can get it uh your body can but that condition if you it guys you can always have supplemental lysine because it inexpensive but what it doesn you start out with 25 G of liquid egg whites you apply heat you got 25 G of solid egg whites and the same thing when you whether or not you processed microfiltration or whether you are applying heated tactics to your whey protein manufacturing you to have 30 gram at the start and 30 Gams over here now you guys know I proponent of using coal processing because I feel like why throw away the other half of the equation here when you don boosting properties especially of way when you apply heat to the immune boosting properties of way they get destroyed lacto Farin is one of them it destroyed it situation over here if we want to maintain the best of all worlds of our protein we won but again the myth out there that you losing protein content that just doesn happen guys so no matter what process you up with the muscle building properties of your way protein regardless of what is being done to it now real quick just to summarize your eggs are going to have your your two allergens one be destroyed by heat and one isn peanuts they they be intensified by heat so if somebody had a peanut allergy way worse to actually have a uh like a roasted peanut than it would be to have a non-heated uh version of that fish completely un uh unaffected so that the in the end of the game guys we basically still have protein as a protein no matter what you it you might want to take some supplemental lysine your immune boosting properties could be affected but if that wouldn was manufactured that said guys we do care how we manufacture our protein we apply cult processes because we do want to have our immune boosting properties if they them in there we don changing anything if we don that processes to what we do so there you have it guys hopefully I don close I was to 4 minutes but you get the idea we just wanted to make sure that we this is always about at athl X giving you guys the information that you need and a matter of fact when we talk about even our supplements here it giving you guys only what you need and nothing that you don athlet and RX has become one of the highest quality most sought after Brands out there because the the applications of science that we put into our videos every week is the same application we put into our supplements that you guys can trust in if you haven them guys headit over to athl rx.com right now and try your first supplement bundle meantime guys if you found this video helpful make sure you leave a thumbs up in a comment below what else would you like to see I know you like to see me at the Whiteboard from time to time let me know what you want me to cover and I surely will all right guys we be back here again real soon thanks	Success
Fat Burner Supplement Scandal (ACTUAL STORE FOOTAGE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2XFaEe-CQs	ATHLEAN - X	what today I that might surprise you a matter of fact it should surprise you and I don whether to laugh cry or put my fist through the camera because of it but let me set the stage for you do you guys all remember Jesse my intern from this past summer if you don Jesse so Jesse helped me film the top 10 workout songs of all time matter of fact he did more than just help me film them he sang them if you haven video it right up here that being said the day that we were shooting that we actually had some time in between takes and the topic of supplementation in the supplement industry as a whole came up now I told him about how I felt about the supplement industry and that there are some major problems and he had actually read the blog series that I did and I description if you have he told me something that I just didn believe he said that he had walked into a pop popular supplement store a week prior to us shooting and have been sold fat burners without even asking he had been sold fat burners now let me show you Jesse one more time this is Jesse so I said there is no way that they even if you went in there and you asked for fat burners because that just would be Beyond irresponsible so we made a bet I said I to go see what you can do about getting supplements and whether or not they would sell them to him what happened next is actually pretty damn shocking how help with something um I just started working out and I don looking for kind that burner um okay so right there I have three major problems number one he whistled and snapped his way right back to the fat burners apparently here without even a hesitation without even a question of asking Jesse if he actually meant what he said secondly Jesse said he really into working out but meanwhile there or not this kid actually needed fat burners and thirdly my big problem here is it to lose this damn bet this what you recommend the most that better better fat burnish so uh okay he went there he burners and not just that he them one of the better fat burners cuz we all know uh Jesse really needs a better fat burner right take one more look at Jesse in case you forgot what he looks like Never Going To Give You Up never going to let you down never going to run around and desert you only because it than most of the regular fat Burns most other fat Burns have just CLA in it which is kind of get a Lola GD that kind of the exact way to to kind of Target it but um this one is a little more intense Yeah by all means why not the intense one we know that 511 140 lb Jesse definitely needs that intense fat burning effect and also not trying to pick on this guy but I suspicious of that pronunciation of conjugated linolic acid I take this at least you might want to take this two times a day if you want to do it pretty fast I would recommend you take it two times a day okay all right perfect thank you problem you got to be [\\xa0__\\xa0] me if he wants to make it work fast he could take it twice a day people if you don then we than I thought the supplement industry is certainly a shady industry but when it we have major major problems now look I salesperson or any One supplement store the fact of the matter is I you supplement store looking for advice Jesse clearly went in there looking for advice and this is the kind of advice he got it was a straight sales pitch to get the strongest fat burner he had in the store and then double up on the dose and if you take one look at Jesse you should know this kid doesn [Applause] burner wow so that actually happened that actually happened that discouraging thing to me that this actually went down not the fact that I lost a bet but more on that in a second the fact is I feel if you salesperson and you advice on especially in health especially on supplements that could actually truly harm you if taken the wrong way then you better be a hell of a lot more responsible than that now I don people feel like it responsibility of that person to make sure that Jesse care of I on the other hand do I think that is the utmost responsibility of that salesperson to make sure that his goals are clearly defined he asked him for help that go here and make a quick fast sale regardless of whatever Jesse asked for fat burners you got them kid here fat burners coming right up what do you feel about it do you feel that this should have been handled differently are you as a Paul by this as I am or am I out of line ask for that bet and the payoff go ahead Jesse soak it in enjoy it I will tell you this even though you got 20 years on me I still wear this shirt better than you do and you know it all right guys in the meantime make sure you leave your comments and your thumbs up below what do you feel about this video again does it make you laugh cry want to punch the screen I think for me a little bit of all three I guys your chance to vent below and I be back here again in a couple days with another new video [Music] here	Success
Workout Supplement Review (LABEL LIES)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n34A6PyB6aE	ATHLEAN - X	what athleanx.com so not sure if you keeping up with the news but the New York Times released an article back on February 3rd entitled what supplements that sort of made a big stir and it should for a very big reason you see the New York State Attorney General went in and purchased herbal supplements from four big retail outlets Walmart Walgreens Target and GNC and guess what they found they found nothing seriously they found nothing because they didn find any of the active ingredients in these formulas instead they found things like groundup house plants rice fillers uh even Christmas decorations they had some Spruce that was used for Christmas decorations that someone ground up and threw in these formulas that you should be getting if you go to a trusted retail outlet like Walgreens Target Walmart jnc but you know what the target here were these four retail stores and got to tell you in the past I stores and said that if you if you don people that are knowledgeable about the product then you responsible brand you responsible store in this case these are major retailers okay especially the Walmart Walgreens and Target they so many things they can everything at some point as the consumer you have to be able to trust the brand okay and in this case these brands are no longer trustworthy and sadly I can say that these brands are not alone you see the the standards here for supplementations are not where it needs to be we know that FDA does not does not step in here and tell you what you should and shouldn even regulate what you should and shouldn something becomes dangerous and I talked about many years ago the dangers of certain supplement ingredients like 13 dimethyl aamine that they had to eventually step in with because people were dying they don late we recently some other supplement brands that have fallen by the wayside because of the things that they to put into their ingred into their formulas that W up becoming dangerous if we have to sit here and worry about whether or not the things that we taking are going to kill us then we not in a very powerful position as consumers when it comes to taking supplements and I can tell you this here right here these herbal ingredients as a supplement manufacturer myself this is the cheap [\\xa0__\\xa0] this is the stuff that doesn out on these things what about when you start to get to the protein supplements there should ever be cheap protein is not cheap highgrade high quality protein is not cheap as a bulk ingredient doesn matter how much of it you buy it cheap so if your supplements are cheap if you elsewhere because you into the same situation that here and there is no regulation about the quality of those supplements that going in those bottles we on the other hand an athlete and our ex and and and this is not a commercial guys you want to whoever says it commercial oh for his products don my stuff do you have a do not buy my stuff I just want to illustrate here that as someone who this industry who has seen some of the scary things you should see how much we go through just to get our supplements to the part where we put our label around the bottle because we actually have our food our supplements tested as food products and by going down the whole food product route now we become susceptible to FDA involvement so we have to make sure that what label matches up as a food product not a supplement if it product FDA doesn a food product FDA wants to know we make sure that that everything we put on our labels matches up with what we say is in is in our bottles and sadly that puts us in another level that puts us in another category and it shouldn everybody should be doing that if you put what bottle see guys this stuff kind of just gets me you know riled up as I said and it right and they do it wrong no we do it right and everybody else should do it right where do we even have an where is this even an option of taking the the wrong road when you things that people put in their bodies so guys again if you haven it look at it and I retailers like I said there that they have to manage to be experts in everything but you have to be the expert you have to rely on Brands you trust not retail outlets that you trust I trust Walgreens I go in there all the time whenever I need a prescription that responsible for trusting everything they put out you have to know your Brands and if you trust athl and RX buy it if you don Brands don somebody else go buy their stuff but at least be aware of what right guys a little bit of a rant here but I hope you found it helpful in the meantime if you found this eye opening you found a little bit aggravating leave your comments Below guys let me know I want to r or rant along with you and if you want more videos make sure you subscribe and I just a couple days with some more stuff all right guys see you later	Success
Food VS. Supplements - The \"Great SUPPLEMENTS Debate\" SOLVED!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIPmlXqDNv4	ATHLEAN - X	we don all in your food well I think it that we take a little bit of a closer look into that and see how actually it could be nearly impossible to pull that off [Music] so guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com you know I talked about it last week I was gonna be back in the gym but there was a little bit of controversy after last week something the series one two and three you know one thing you can always get from you guys is you the whole facts you presentation and then I allow you guys to determine whether or not what I saying is vs you know if you want you can like to present you with the facts so kind of like a few weeks ago we do with that fly exercise and you know again there want to always present to you the facts when it comes to supplements a lot of guys will come and I even see some of the comments they they you can get everything you need from from the food that I eat and then they went away and then no one ever hears from them again it stick to and matter of fact a lot of people that will lead the charge and lead the way with that and say that you don everything you need from food and guys I think it someone that addresses that and shows you unless you decide again for yourself whether or not that let me put together a video discuss some of these things and let you see now I kind of narrowed it down to more than undisputable supplement ingredients right so the ones that we know that have been backed by science and tons and tons of studies that show their effectiveness we know what the effective dose is we know what the benefits are so as you see I kind of decided for this video let me just go through creatine Omega threes glutamine and protein okay we sticking to the ones that we know we have a lot of research to show are great for us and we know that they benefit us when we we talk about creative first I do a little bit of math on here while we do it but basically with creatinine if we going to rely on real food sources to get it you creatine for every one pound of beef that you eat now think about that for a second because what we have here in front of me my dogs were let me borrow their meat here they eat well but this here is two and a half pounds of beef okay two and a half pounds of beef so if we wanted to get the five grams of creatine that we need for a maintenance dose a little bit of math tells us that we need two and a half pounds of beef per day this is what you have to eat per day of beef to get your creativity now that that along with this you all the saturated fat you all the extra calories that you probably don that at that point we what you need just to get the creatin so think about that and remember it just hold on and see if you can fit the rest of the stuff in your stomach next Omega threes right we omega-3s again indisputable we know that Omega threes are important I did a video on that before if you look at this here actually you could probably link up with the link to the video over here if you haven what we of tuna you have 0.2 seven grams of EPA DHA which is what we active part of our mega threes we need if we recommended dose was about 1.8 grams per day of the active ingredient which in omega-3 formula the ones that that my father created is three three three pills so that looking to happen to have not two or three or four this is salmon but you know again fatty fish to number seven six of these a day to get your recommended dose of Omega threes to have the effect that the studies show is most effective so on top of your two and a half pounds of beef you got to have six cans of tuna or salmon and again we not even factoring in maybe some of the other aspects of this the mercury of the heavy metals that you yourself to by eating fish because you don you number two next thing glutamine now the way that we calculate glutamine is that basically in all of our protein intake for day around the numbers very good around three or four percent or so it comes from the glutamine itself so that constituent of that protein will be glutamine three percent so if you think about that for a second every 100 grams of protein that you take in in a day you being from glutamine well the effective dose of glutamine is five grams twice a day now in the RX series we put five grams and the post-workout with five grams in the in the RX 3 reconstruction overnight recovery supplement so what you have three grams would give you a hundred grams of protein would give you three grams of glutamine 200 grams would give you six grams of glutamine three hundred grams of protein would give you about nine grams of glutamine still even a little bit less than what you would need in a day so now we hundred grams of protein we cans of tuna we pounds of beef and we still don everything that we need so now if we looking at our protein itself let say we want to talk about protein let just break it down simply with art with chicken so you during the day one of the most accepted forms of the ratios of what protein you need of the day is one gram per pound of body weight so let pound guy you to shoot for 180 grams of protein well let this and we right here basically I first with my wife who is sort of the expert shopper and I I don it you know I would fail at prices right for sure she says that it 399 per pound for chicken breast right now you can probably get it a little bit cheaper if you of bulk like we talked about before but let get each chicken breast has their in every three and a half ounces of chicken is 30 grams of protein so if we wanted to get 180 grams we have to basically multiply these three and a half five six and I believe that comes out to 21 so we basically need 21 ounces which is 1.25 one of a quarter pounds a day well at four at four dollars a pound or so you let number is four fifty four thousand fifty cents per day times 30 is 120 plus another 15 what one hundred thirty-five dollars a month in protein so guys it not even cheap to eat this way let alone you know and we didn how much it would cost for for your meat as well so guys the point of the matter here is that our supplements necessary no I have never said that supplements are necessary however if you want to benefit from the what these ingredients here what these known substances have been proven to do so in science then you don benefit from creating but you gonna take creatine you through your food don gonna benefit from omega-3s but you not gonna take a mega threes because you don all the benefits of the recovery of glutamine but you glutamine because supplements aren good and you your food guys one of the matter is you have to question you can out there and then run away and say I told them you know you all from food he you garbage you gotta look at the facts and the facts are if you supplements and get the benefits of the ingredients that you want your if you gonna try to get the Memphis you going to need to take supplements so the faculty matter is guys in closing here do you have to take my supplements absolutely 100% no I one to force you down the road of my stuff if you want I recommended you the stuff that I take I recommend you the stuff that I do I recommend that you do the workouts that I do and I want to pass that stuff on to you because it meant a lot to me and I feel like it benefits you guys but you the always had the option the freedom of choice to go out there any other program any other system any other nutrition plan any whatever you want to do so the fact is guys choices choice you have the choice I appreciate you all watching the videos but let get it straight supplements are they necessary to me they can the results differ they may differ a lot it decide what haven athleanx.com grab the 90 day training program yes the program that I promote here every week guys why because I think it works and I believe it help you if you haven over athlean-rx com yes the supplements that I promote why because I feel like they worked for me and now I feel like you can ban finish well I take them every every day so guys I appreciate it all I look forward to bringing to you another workout now next week we the supplements away for a little while and get back to the gym and get back to work I days cool young wait [Music]	Success
Supplements Review Part 3 - High Grade OMEGA-3s (Muscle Recovery Monster!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CdAxnDPbg	ATHLEAN - X	h [Music] H hey guys Jeff Cavalier here from aex.com and back in here in the gym but not using weights but back in a whiteboard for my professorial moment here how that the uh that sort of I character to try to explain to you why this next supplement here in the supplement review is probably the most important one you in your body and if you why you absolutely should be it omega-3 fatty acids now you guys have written in and asked me a lot of questions about this I figured let me address this but let me show you sort of about the board why it is where what I it is as important as I feel it is over here quickly some of the health benefits of Omega-3s that have been documented in you know well researched as a matter of fact it that Association because it increases HDL cholesterol that it decreases your blood triglycerides it decreases heart disease as a result of all this been shown to decrease cancer risk especially prostate and colon cancer in men increased insulin sensitivity that decreasing arthritic pain whether it be from rheumatoid arthritis or whether it be from osteoarthritis improve liver metabolism and then most importantly for you guys because this is you really building muscle and improved physique is increase and faster Muscle Recovery I here and increased fat mobilization which means faster metabolism and fat loss all of these things guys are are caused by inflammatory conditions okay Omega-3s are going to be your number one element your number one Ally in the battle against inflammation and inflammation when it gets out of hand is a bad thing as we see with all these other medical conditions inflammation when it gets out of hand for Muscle Recovery is going to set you backward I don be taking the best glutamine the best protein powder the best creatin it going to work because if you negative state of of of inflammation you to recover so very very very important let me show you quickly how this all works we basically have cells let there surface of a cell we have a receptor and it that certain elements can that match up to that shape can come in here here and lock in so again we have two parts of this we have an omega3 and something called Omega sixes now Omega sixes are free floating in your body they readily available and they get into these cells but the problem is Omega sixs are inflammatory they ones that cause all of this stuff so you want to be able to get your Omega-3s to get into this space before them it like a parking spot you know you the malls during uh Christmas time everybody spot the first one to get in is the happy you know is the happy one the one that pissed off so you don to be the one that gets left out but you want that Omega 6 to be left out and just drive around because if they just are left to be free floating they can exert any of those inflammatory conditions it that cell can they cause inflammation so we want Omega sixes in here all right we problem is your body can you have to have your Omega-3s come through your diet and the issue here is that the only way to really get them is through fatty fishes and people are not eating fish enough matter of fact to get the active ingredients that you need EPA that high-grade fish EPA and dhaa you to get about 1.2 to 1.8 grams of this stuff that would amount to about 6 to 8 ounces of fish every single day of the year and I don fish fan or not I I like it but I eating it 7 days a week 365 days a year and if you do you still got to wor about all the contaminants and all the bad fish that you especially if they that ocean you where we had the uh you know the the BP oil spill a little bit earlier this year so not a good idea to just continue to eat uh eat fish so you need to have some way to get it supplemental now if that you think that all supplements are created equal they absolutely are not in this case because a lot of the grades of fish a lot of the fish oil that is available like in GNC and on the shelves that is from a lowgrade fish they don use the highest purification processes they don different siphoning techniques that get rid of the heavy metals and and the Mercury and things like that so you have to guys in this case if you if you to invest in a high-grade fish oil and there fact laa you probably seen a lot of the commercials especially during the Super Bowl they sell for $150 a month and it extremely expensive but it worth the investment because the only way you grade and the active ingredients most of the other low-grade fish oils provide you with free fatty acids that make up about 90% of the actual pill whereas you don because they don to have EPA DHA and that when you get your high grade now as far as a specific brand guys I was actually lucky to grow up in a household where my father was a for you know foremost Pioneer in the in the U the use of fish oils to treat medical conditions he he Cavalier and he has used it in his practice for all these things I use it called Dr C but you know he didn the uh the coolness of affan X but he got he know I I guys but I am here to at least show you and provide you with the stuff that I use I wouldn you that I don something I while I can it physique today it has absolutely you know contributed to my faster Muscle Recovery through it anti-inflammatory properties and through increased fat mobilization so my metabolism just goes a lot quicker because I every day for the last 20 years it staple of my program and I would never U not use it it formula.com for you guys that want to use the same exact stuff but if not just try to find one of these high-grade fish oils again prescription grade fish oil is laesa three capsules of Omega-3 formula is the same exact content that you would have to get with the um uh laesa for that you need prescription for but guys don of Omega-3s they are the gatekeeper to the success of all your other supplements if you negative inflammatory balance right now it doesn your other pills and and and supplements are they thanks again for allowing me to do these things I like the supplement reviews if you have any more questions send them in to us at get rifted athlete next I review some more supplements for you but I of the the the information that you can use to make your own decision and uh and go from there guys uh back in the gym again next week not in front of the Whiteboard and I teacher hat for a while I doing the gym workouts and stuff that you guys like too I [Music] h h [Music]	Success
PREWORKOUT SUPPLEMENTS | Pre Workout Poison | MUST WATCH!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KotrpCy7w2M	ATHLEAN - X	h [Music] H hey guys what athleanx.com and uh we board here and as you can probably see this is no ey chart this is actually the name of something uh that a lot of you guys are probably familiar with and I think it review on something called 13 dimethyl aamine um or more formally one3 dith it these days and and I figured I would tell you that I don like it and I think I you why I I I think it everyone to say um to take a stance and make an opinion on something but just try to support it with a little bit of evidence just to say hey maybe you should think twice about it before you put this in your body and I just want to lay out why and what first of all the history on this stuff it names it could be called dmaa methylhexanamine or geranamine and the reason why it is actually derivative it was taken from a geranium plant and extracted from there I think it was I think it was China or Japan that part I sure about but that initially found it and then here in uh in the states Eli Lily was going to use it to treat um as as a nasal decongestant number one then also to treat like a uh overgrowth of mouth tissue so if that when you Iron you want to treat mouth tissue growth um maybe this is for you but really honestly all aside that that was the history of it and people then came out and said that it was dangerous because recently because they said chemically it amphetamine but that know I want to go back before I was a uh a physical therapist I was actually a a biochem guy I was a phys neurobiologist major in in college and I loved organic chemistry so if you let me just kind of show you some real basic stuff I promise I won meth looks like this and doesn have to mean anything to you but this is the chemical structure of 13 dith all right and the structure of a fedrin which we know is sort of has this uh same effects and we effects in in a second here it looks like this this again a little bit of similar structure but it this fenel group is what this is called on here a six carbon uh group on the end as does an amphetamine which is what they say this is it derivative but is not chemically similar to amphetamine because an amphetamine is also going to have this feno group on the end so structurally you know there nitrogen atoms in every one but that about it but that doesn doesn that use that and they take it and they run with and they say well it it not chemically similar but it has similar effects there is no doubt about it that it is a sympathomimetic drug which means it actions of the sympathetic nervous system which means that you get uh uh rapid heart rate you to get increased blood pressure um you constriction you know those are all things that are going to tend to elevate your heart heart uh your heartbeat you know your uh your heart rate it to ele elevate your your blood pressure and Guys these are the kind of things that especially when you combine them with exertion and activity can lead to a stroke okay I that I don said or not it can lead to a stroke and it done such in people there are studies out there that have shown and now it being labeled as like party drug or so so I don to put 25 milligrams in your product is what there is what most of them have in there fine right but I know that most guys don guys want more they feel like I bigger guy and I need a little bit more so I mine now you trouble and I not a smart idea so anybody that selling their stuff that has 139 meth in it want to come attack me I I I there on affle next to kind of sort through some of the things that are worth it and some of the things that I don me ask you one final question how do you think they get this ability to have this it anti-doping agency how do you think they get this in their product just another sort of trick with the supplement industry is that geranium oil which is where it is an approved food product it other things geranium oils and other things it is not an approved drug okay okay so if you go and you claim the source geranium oil you can use this stuff so is it is it right no is it is it a little bit shady I think so but basically guys I just wanted to kind of give you the uh The Rundown so you can make your own educated decision as far as Alternatives go guys how about sleep you know sleep good active uh recovery you know getting yourself on a regular sleep cycle eating well good nutrition hydration you know if you want to have something for for a natural burst B vitamins um caffeine has been a well researched supplement well researching you know um uh substance that you can have you know in controlled amounts less than 200 you know 200 250 300 milligram it to 600 milligrams in athletes and shown that it suggest that but it you need to start turning to this and it just sort of my two cents and um I figured you guys would would benefit from it guys if you haven seen what have a little review going on right now on my blog at aex.com blog where you be able to sort of check out what I think the top five biggest problems are with supplements today you can see that over the the blog again aex.com blog in the meantime guys let ourselves in shape how about that you going to feel a lot better A lot more energetic you won stuff if you yourself to do that go to aex.com grabb that program guys get the 90day program you summertime right around the corner get in the best shape of your life and uh be proud of it and feel good and you have energy all right I back here again in the gym but next week we see you then [Music] h [Music]	Success
PREWORKOUT Supplements - \"Workout Supplement ATHLEAN-Rx SERIES\"	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSndeusUcHc	ATHLEAN - X	when it comes to supplements we all know you going to show you today why these three are the best options that you can make when it comes to supplementing around your workout schedule Ree [Music] what I should say athleen RX because uh I promised you last week that we would be taking a look into supplements and the importance of making the right decisions when it comes to what you put in your body we all know like I said in the intro there are a lot of choices when it comes to uh supplements these days unfortunately um we have to deal with a lot of bad choices and I think we also have to deal with a lot of confusion too as to what actually do we need and uh what don step further is when do we actually need this stuff because there are very you know particular times when you should take certain supplements that are actually going to have an effect and if you take it in later point in the day or too far removed from your workout or not too you know close to the workout beforehand you results whereas you would have had you taken it at the right time so thinking through all this stuff we know that there supplements we could take them individually we know that creatine is is a good supplement we know glutamine is good we know whey protein uh branchin amino acids uh we have lots and lots of know pre-workout stimulant we have lots of choices but again it because by the end of the day you going to wind up with 20 30 bottles laying in front of you you know on the counter and you should be taking them so that brings me to athleen RX and I want to tell you guys exactly what went into this these are months and months you probably remember if you were following me here on uh on YouTube or were even follow me over on Facebook or even my blog you know the updates were kind of on a descending uh path for a long time that busy in creating my own supplement line because I was really kind of fed up with what I had as options out there you know we video before about how I absolutely hate uh 13 dith and how it actually is in almost every single supplement these days I banned and you don it in your body you know that was kind of the jump off point for me saying and I have to get something better out there that you guys can take reliably so I went to work I I I went and uh basically wrapped myself up in what can I do to produce the best supplement line out there and I and I really believe that that we did 1 two and three that now you the other supplements they cuz I was actually able to get everything that you need exactly when you need it so I want to show you here in the pieces exactly what it is uh that goes into RX1 rx2 and rx3 and what makes them different and when you should take them so let start taking a look at athleen RX1 all right so we pre-workout here and uh athleen RX1 now I other stuff that I don single pre-workout these days now is including 13 dimethyl aamine which I talked about in a separate video If you haven just link it up here um that you can go watch that video if you are if you taking that supplement watch this video then come back and watch this one cuz I think it that message out to you uh I don you should be taking it but as far as athle RX now this video might be a little bit more of the extended version here like that 13 tips that I did a while back for abs but you guys said you liked it I want to get into the details you understand what it is that you putting in your body but with aen RX1 I kind of broke it down just a little bit here uh in a little bit of a cheat sheet but we kind of have like different different areas of focus now when you talking about pre-workout what is the goal the goal is to have an ability to generate energy to get you to the workout and you got to have the energy to be a sustain it so you can get through the workout without a drop off because again even if it performance for my athletes we don want to be able to have um a good burst of energy at the start of the game but a tail off in performance by the end of the game so we want to be able to get the energy and be able to sustain it and we also want to be able to do this without dehydrating you because we know that a lot of the Pre-Workout stimulants are you know dehydrators so if you look at what we did here with with athlan RX1 for our energy component we have both both the natural and uh and herbal form of of caffeine so caffeine and hydras would be the clinical you know version of caffeine and we have G Gana which is our our herbal version of caffeine now why would I use caffeine because it the most well-researched uh safe pre-workout stimulant that you can put in your body it uh by all organizations the national anti- doing agency everything is is approved you know uh with caffeine so we use very very safe levels of this you know you want to get enough for a stimulate effect so you know just slightly more than a cup of coffee but well underneath the the uh levels that would produce Jitters and and uh and nerves and you know any side effects that would deter from your performance so we toine which we Bull really the main component of of Red Bull um and green tea you we that researched you know through uh you know the active ingredient in green tea can help with you metabolism and increasing your abil ability to uh generate you know the energy from the food that that you component the next thing we have is our ability to continue this this um uh you know Energy Drive throughout your workout here you B vitamins B3 and b12 again a major component of like 5 Hour Energy um really which is really all that is uh beta alanine acetylcarnitine uh tyrosine now let me just point out a little bit here beta alanine that works is the the beta alany can actually increase studies I actually done on humans guys you know the not on animals and labat but human Studies have shown that can increase uh carnosine content in your muscle cells your your type two muscle fibers by about 52% even just over a short period of time like four weeks what that does is that helps to improve a provide a buffer for lactic acid so as you start to work out and you start to have the lactic acid build up car is via the beta alanine is going to help to deter that and prolong your time to fatigue acetylcarnitine it can actually take the acetal Group which again a little bit nerdy I guys we uh nerdy Direction but just so you understand what it is and how it works it it donates that acetyl group to something called acetyl COA which is an enzyme that actually helps to um really run it metabolic cycle so you know again we don metabolic Cycles here but this is this is the one that generating your your energy and acetal COA is the is the gasoline that will drive that engine so we can donate the acetal group to that and continue to sort of recycle and replenish that so you and then again uh you know tyrosine very you know very effective you know supplements here guys very effective compounds that do the job and do them well and do them safely next thing you notice we have Branch chain amino acids now people are very familiar with Branch Branch chain amino acids but not in the sense of being a pre-workout addition and I can tell you it it branchin amino acids already broken down into their metabolized form can provide not only the energy for some you know some useful energy to use to get you through your workout but they so in a small enough dose that causing too much of a overload on your stomach and at the same time it of setting that stage for the post-workout reconstruction that you going to want to have happen in your muscle cells cuz we again there too but here you almost have that sort of jump start on it so to me a Pro workout that ignores branchin amino acids is actually not a uh not a wise idea and we didn one and then we alphaet glutarate these are things that actually will help with the uh uh ability to drive blood flow to the muscles so we can recruit more blood to the muscles provide more energy take away some of that lactic acid and flush it out it just is a better way now some guys will take it for the muscle pump that they this supplement but uh I big believer in that I mean you might experience a little bit of that but long term that um ex except for more the the vanity aspects I part the the the real key here are that those we actually bring blood to to the muscles the working muscles and assist them functioning longer and then finally we don we we include electrolytes as well so we might get a little bit of a dehydrating effect because of the um caffeine but we want to be able to rehydrate through Water by drinking water actually mixing this with water but at the same time bring in those uh electrolytes as well to replenish that because you never want to just rep try to replenish just water without the electrolytes you want to have them both athlan RX has them both in there so guys as I get a lot of these things individually there out there unfortunately every single brand that I know of now is is is dipping into that realm of adding one three dith because people are asking for that and want that I not is it not only not safe for you long term but there are alternatives that are 100% safe that are going to provide not only that immediate burst in energy but we sustained uh energy that you need need to get through your workout so athlan RX1 guys I actually tastes really good too so uh uh I the post-workout this you about 30 minutes or so before your workout we post-workout next accelerate it young GRE [Music] a	Success
MUSCLE RECOVERY Supplements - \"Workout Supplement ATHLEAN-Rx SERIES\"	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vzcwe5O9xAY	ATHLEAN - X	no this video is not about my dog or it is how to have a more productive sleep when it comes to building muscle I going to show you how with the right supplement you can build maximum muscle while you and resting it [Music] hey guys Jeff Cavalier athleen x.com here we are wrapping up our series here I hope you enjoyed it so far we part three we of people will probably give up on supplementation which is right here at night time because they figure let focus only on what we do before our workout and after our workout I could tell you right now that it is actually probably the most important time that you can actually supplement the right way because this is the time when your body actually repairs itself and recovers and grows and that is resting at night now if you X Program you know I many times rest and Recovery is the key to the success of the program well on this program we also know that taking advantage of the time when we rest and recover with the right supplementation is going to help you immensely so we have athleen rx3 now you can see it right here now what I do is just take it uh right before bed again we show you why it so different about it than most post-workout supplement or well most recovery supplements if you look at the ing L is very it what should be guys no fillers no no unhealthy ingredients here we I uh especially if you can the camera there but we have hicka which is something brand new and exciting Lucic acid glutamine we with that ala zinc melatonin and casin now as far as the hicka stuff goes guys um I don labr at all but they a hiup product and and uh um it an interesting compound it um it actually has the ability to tell your body when it um its amino acids in burning them for uh for fuel as opposed to using them to help construct new muscle it gives you that one line of direct communication with your sort of with your own body amino acid storage so that it can direct it more to in an anabolic way than being burned uh for energy so it like being able to flip the switch on what path met the metabolic uh usage of that amino acid is taking whether it going to be productive and helping you build muscle or whether it to be used and uh we always want it to be used for in this case at night for rebuilding and regenerating new muscle so very exciting uh supplement glutamine we all know about glutamine uh the most abundant amino acid in the body um you want to be able to take around 10 g a day if you remember back in part two we talked about there post-workout supplement now we put an additional 5 gr here right at night we know that we utilize glutamine we we burn it up as we as we train so we want to be able to uh preserve those storage so that we can maintain those uh glutamine levels while we work out and utilize them there so if we can replenish them here at night and keep those uh body storage levels muscle storage topped off we doing a good thing for us there grams of glutamine in there ala ala is is uh you know primarily used as a uh absorption device you know a compound that actually helps us to absorb what it is we put in our body it ala the majority of vitamins the majority of things that you take into your body if you don are we doing we them out right so ala helps us to keep most of that stuff I like to think of it as the uh the the compound and ingredient that uh keeps the the money in your pocket so if you however much on supplements per month you know you might only be utilizing about 20 bucks worth of that and the rest of it with ala it helps to actually M you know to preserve all that we put it here in also the post-workout as well but now here at night um zinc zinc is a very important um uh you know natural naturally occurring compound that we have uh really active in almost every single metabolic um reaction you know it participates in almost every single enzymatic reaction as a as a substrate and that does is it helps our hormones you know to uh to actually U function the way that they know if you have disturbances in in enzymes doesn that soort again I don too crazy here but whatever the goal of that reaction is if you don enzyme the reaction can you don preserve the enzyme so it cascading effect and you want to start with the main ingredient here the main substrate and that would be zinc so you want to take that it also has been shown to boost immunity as well so a great supplement you could take at night um leading right into that night time melatonin guys stress um working out extremely hard which you should be with the athlet next program um many many things will actually disturb your natural sleep patterns what they call the Cadian rhythms if you it we all have seen that you stressed out about an exam or you been stressed out about something at work you know and you can those things will actually disturb your your natural sleep pattern but supplementation with melatonin and natural sleep aid so very very very low levels here it reestablish the right Rhythm the right sleep patterns for you so you can actually get back and and maximize the amount of hours that you deep sleep at night as opposed to kind of up and down up and down very shallow sleep you well you day so another thing and then finally the main the main uh ingredient here casing protein all right more than 20 gr of casin protein um what does it do well we know that there are different types of protein we discussed that in part two the fact of the matter is you want to take the right protein at the right time Cas and protein that you find in reconstruction is there because it slow digesting protein now as we discussed in part two you don take a slow digesting protein right after your workout when your muscles are craving that replenishment you want to take a slow digesting protein when you without eating something so if you look at that situation that your post-workout is right you looking at a time I mean your recovery night time recovery is a time where you maybe eight hours of sleep without eating anything so you want to have a protein that can actually slowly slowly break down provide that sustained release throughout the night this is when you want to take casing protein this is why it this whole series here athlan RX1 2 and three it when you need it and without all that other garbage and you can go out there guys I reputable Brands I reputable brand but I hope I that you do trust I hope you understand that at athl RX and athl X everything I do is to create a program and to create a supplementation system that you can rely on to get results and to get them safely this is what I did with athlan RX you know again you can go out there and buy glutamine separately you can go out there and buy creatin you can go out there and buy whey protein you can have your Cas protein your bill is going to run you $400 a month $500 a month you might as well have a car payment for crying out loud with athl RX for just a little over $100 guys I kept it as actually as as bare bonus as I could in terms of the price to keep it affordable for everybody um this is what we came up with you know the three-step system one two and three um everything everything that you need you know the only other thing you could possibly need um we talked about before high GR Omega 3 is very very important as far as aiding in in in Muscle Recovery and a multivitamin so guys I hope you enjoyed this series uh

POSTWORKOUT Supplements - \"Workout Supplement ATHLEAN-Rx SERIES\"	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw1jAGdP_vQ	ATHLEAN - X	you just finished killing it in the gym you gave your all but it in the next 45 minutes that determines the success the ultimate success that you you just had it post-workout nutrition Ree [Music] hey guys Jeff Cavalier athlet x.com here we are part two of our supplement series and uh you can see I gym which means hopefully I just finish another hard athlet next workout and uh we all know we workouts one of the most important times to get in the right stuff for your muscles to help Kickstart that repair process and uh you actually true and that window of opportunity you know between 30 minutes and 45 minutes after your workout again very very true um what about what it is that you need to take I mean we about whey protein and glutamine and you know creatin and should creatin take you know be taken before your workout or after your workout well all this stuff is true and all of these are really good questions but the fact of the matter is you have a lot of options out there and unfortunately a lot of guys will rely on trying to buy many different separate things so they their glutamine they protein it the almost a um you know a pretty hefty bill at the end of the month uh you know few cell phone bills I think at least but is it necessary is it necessary to buy it that way and I say absolutely 100% not no because what you have to do is you can take everything all in one shot and get everything to your muscles exactly the way it needs it exactly when you need it which is what athleen RX is all about so my choice here affan accelerate which is the post-workout in the ex in the RX series one two and three guys when you see what thing you this is exactly what you need to be taken because there other fillers in here and another garbage that you don show you exactly what it is and why remember I don can always question what it is I do I I take it I think it to explain to you why it is the thing you know why why I put something in here why I think you should take um something as part of your post-workout and that what I want to do explain this so if it gets a little bit long or a little bit scientific at times you know just understand where it coming from me wanting to be able to make sure that you rx2 we have way isolate I over these again we have way is protein I think you can see that 20 G of way isolate protein 5 G of BCAAs again getting in we have pre-workout we got it kick started now we it up with another five grams of BCAAs we have glutamine in here five grams of glutamine which again at night you know we another five grams you in the next part of the video video series crealine it sound a little bit like creatin to you guys and it different and I a bit of a Epiphany when it comes to creatin I hmb another you know metabolic Uh u i mean you know something that help you actually to to recover post uh post workout and then ala and absorb you know absorption Aid so let me go back over this real quick the the way I slit um we know that there are many many different types of protein you know we have Branch amino acids which are all already you know pretty much broken down into the fully uh metabolized form you have way isolate you have whey concentrate you and people get confused as to when it good for when it different various forms or or should they take anything different should they just take whey protein well whey is a really highly absorbable form of uh protein and it concentrated again if you get the the isolated form it very effective the muscles will will will absorb that quickly and readily and that now after after your workout protein is going to help you to Kickstart that recovery to get your muscles into that you know back into that anabolic mode right away which we sustain throughout the night as you see with part three in our in our reconstruction with our our um with our nighttime recovery BR chin amino acids again we talked about them as well they another form of Highly absorbable protein which we can start to utilize in our muscles to repair them get them back you know get them rebound recovery remember athl EX all about recovery you have to be able to recover from your workouts to be able to come back the next day apply another stress to it by liting the weights you know the heavy weights and then give you providing the stimulus right here with the bar but then providing the recover with what it is that you take you know right here with athlan RX glutamine five grams of glutamine we actually like I said put that in there the most abundant amino acid in the body you deplete it as you work out especially if you work out hard so we want to be able to replenish that and we with by you know putting it right in this post-workout right when you need it remember guys your supplementation is all about what you take and also when you take it glutamine after a workout taking it then which leads us right into the next Point here creatine creatin guys post-workout supplement for me um I know believability of of creating as a as an energy precursor so guys that take it before their workout um I think if you could just keep your levels topped off which is why once we get to our maintenance dose we think it that creatin can have by by keeping your muscle cells hydrated by keeping that environment hydrated so that we know that a a hydrated environment is more anabolic you know it a a flower in the desert you know the likelihood of of it staying alive very long is is not very high but you put that in a in in in a a pot with water and and you you you know you you pay attention to it that plant is going to go grow and Thrive and that what happens with your muscles You to have a hydrated environment for that to happen so creatin is a great uh source for that but the source of creatin creatin monohydrate which I been on record on videos here talking about the great benefit of creates monohydrate it was until I actually talked to a scientist when I was going through the the development of the aaric supplements about the benefits of copin and I be able to hear what it is what are the benefits and I came away from that very convinced that crealine is the uh the form of creatin you want to take why because it it it pH scale that we have in in in chemistry you know anything that pH is going to be more B more acidic and something that called more alkaline well anything that less acidic is going to be better received by the body so when you can get that pH of the in your body to be right where it needs to be you you have a better chance to absorb what it is not just the cre the creatin but everything else that you supplement and even further out throughout the rest of the day crealine because of that because it absorbed by the muscles allows us to take lower dosages every day actually too so we doses of only 2 to 3 G of crein versus the five gr that you need for Crea monohydrate so you not see any creatinine build up usually from taking crealine which you could see is a byproduct from the creatin monohydrate so all you know all advantages of my sense and crein is more expensive because of that but guys it worth every single penny so I would switch to the crein form if I were you and I would also take it in the post-workout and that is why again I included it in athlan rx2 and then again on the bottom here hmb shown to be uh help in recovery um you lot we had burn patients they did many many studies in humans burn patients took hmb actually helped to uh to preserve uh proteins you know and conserve them and not not utilize them uh as much so you can use them in a more anabolic sense and uh ala which is uh I I bit more in the in part three but it um it it take to help you actually keep some of those dollars that you your supplements uh going to uh what they know actually being used um instead of buying your supplements and peeing away half of what you what you take because you you to absorb it and again as a post-workout when it absorption how much can you get into your muscle cells after a hard workout that why it part three of this series coming very very soon we nighttime recovery the most important time I think in the whole day for getting your recovery and your your workout supplementation right you going to see exactly how to do it and uh you know in the meantime head over to athleen rx.com if you don wait to complete the series and grab your three-part kit

Slim Legs Workout (4 BEST EXERCISES)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVloVlkX0Ng	ATHLEAN - X	hey Fitness friends its trainer amy-jo and today I want to bring you the four of my best slimming leg exercises [Music] all right so we all have different goals right some of us want bigger stronger legs some of us want longer leaner legs and that is what is my goal break down what your goal is and then you have to reverse-engineer that and figure out what are the best exercises for you but for the sake of this video this is called the four best Glen leg exercises I want to show you four of them that really are gonna help you do that okay so the anatomy of the legs right our quadriceps our hamstrings inner thigh outer thigh and making those slimmer we all have different genetics but using the exercises to help added muscle mass and then also burn a lot of calories at the same time is really what give you that slimmer longer look all right so a few of the exercises I wanted to put together really are gonna help us do that one of the ones that I wanted to start with is single leg exercise mainly for the fact that you are burning more calories when you on one leg at a time so you time I have to focus on my left leg then I have to still go and do my right leg so it gonna burn more calories focusing that and then it also helps with the muscle imbalances which is really important when you want slimmer legs so making sure that your legs are balanced preventing injuries so you can continue to train hard and achieve your goals so the first exercise this is gonna be a dumbbell step-up all right and I a lot of you have seen these done them but the big thing that you want to focus on is not bouncing off this back toe on the ground so you want to make it heavy enough dumbbells in hand two dumbbells or a barbell even on your shoulders and stepping up coming down okay and really this should be your heavy exercise so going about eight to ten is my advice that pushing through this heel coming down and making sure you of this back toe here cuz literally you get stronger and slimmer you off of this toe here which ends up becoming a calf exercise you want that so make sure you heel and then coming up pushing the pub posture up at the top then when you switch okay I dumbbell you leaving room for my other hand to hold the dumbbell you can hold two if you a barbell on your back sometimes helps with individual - you need to really focus on their posture at the top okay and you pushing through that heel eight to ten alright so you can see that not nailing out my left leg and then a lean out my right leg eight to ten that a while so I calories so it that my second exercise is side lunges so when we also talked about slimming the legs you don area you want to focus on the whole entire leg right so side lunges creates a different angle it also helps hit different areas in the glutes hamstrings and quadriceps so doing different movements is really important so side lunge and then pushing off of that outer foot okay this is an excellent one you can use a kettlebell right in front of you you can just hold a dumbbell here some individuals that you know they wrist pain you can put a weight up on your shoulder here okay the rest same concept okay and then also I getting a little inner thigh here as I coming down and then I that pushing off this outer glute so I then I switch and that dumbbell on the outer shoulder reason being is that I to push through this force right here so if it down this way the dumbbell being on this shoulder I have to use more of this abductor here push off all right eight to ten same thing nice and heavy this is my second top exercise here push off all right these are great keep make sure that leg gets straight stay nice and straight all right oh okay and then also beginners if you okay just stay nice and low here push through that heel make sure that you are perfecting your form here and you falling forward or I see this a lot actually I a lot this is slightly bent here right okay so this leg is kind of working keep it straight so maybe nail without weight first get that form down and then begin to add weight reminder eight to ten add strength so you are adding give me the hypertrophy okay somebody next to number three and four I popped in to plyos so my thought with this is we definitely want to heavy exercises to add muscle mass so you your legs are stronger and when you adding more muscle mass obviously the muscle is protruding out of the legs it skin so there are four more muscle mass is going to make your legs look tighter they look slimmer they and that that you but also plyometrics are great exercise for increasing caloric burn my heart rate is gonna go through the roof on a plyometric exercise especially after I my favorites really simple we all know them but they are great to definitely incorporate when you stronger leaner legs okay lunch jumps landing in the lunge position once again this is a single leg exercise right so I right leg every time that I lunge and alternating so it even think about the breakdown how long is that exercise taking me and that the cardio so it your heart rate up if you lot of calories plus when I hub lunch jumps my legs are on fire so that that last exercise is doing the jumps which is the single legs okay so I really want to make sure that we are understanding movements and different directions so that okay there your frontal and you in a frontal plane this is horizontal side to side okay so you squat and then up and jumping and the important thing with this is once again I it I have to focus more on one leg at a time so the unilateral exercises are really important to incorporate we were trying to strengthen and get a leg look that you want so side squat jumps plyos side this is a great start for beginners if you want to place a step right here you could put your foot on the top you can elevate it you can even go as high as this if you want to make sure you over cuz bad form produces injuries and then you can you don to make sure that you have good form and you and that defeats the purpose so we have two heavy lists two plyos combine those together and honestly that I would start with two sets of each exercise just like you maybe go to maybe go to three sets and if you want to build those legs up and you feel like you can handle more go four rounds increase the weight slow down the motions and I guarantee you you some awesome games in your legs thanks for joining me I feedback below let me know what you guys want to see more of really helps motivate me and encourage me to give you guys more content that really helps you have a great day see ya	Success

10 Minute BOOTY LIFT (Total Glute Isolation)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXX2eAA2NzA	ATHLEAN - X	hey ladies its trainer amy-jo today we are interested in that so come join me let first exercise is a combination of the bench and a BOSU this is a 10 minute video for booty lifting so I it with you guys first one you your hips on top of the BOSU on the bench okay this allows you to get a better stretch for the first exercise we gonna hold on to the front of the bench okay and you and you the ceiling so you don them apart you don together either just keep them about hip width and we and squeeze ten nine eight seven six five four three two last one and squeeze stay right here you alternating swimmer kicks so now your feet are elevated and I want you to focus on pelvis tilting so you relax the low back you shouldn hyper extending your low back you want to be in the glutes okay so now I gonna kick one leg at a time all right we position squeezing the booty squeeze squeeze alternate ten more and ten nine eight seven six five four three pelvis a pelvis tilted and one great we do one more exercise there so let me just show you the position you don want to be here when you the BOSU you want to pelvis tilt so rotate your pelvis under it helps lengthen the spine and make sure that you isolating the gluts not your low back it important so take your time to really learn that and master that before you jump into these all right in our third one lying on the BOSU your knees are now bent and your heels are touching and I want you to visualize there you and then come back down these aren trying to get as high as you can with that pelvis tilted squeezing just the glutes all right press and squeeze this is really gonna help give the booty a lift pump the glutes squeeze five more five four three two last one one so those three right there our creative way for you to target the glutes and not put so much pressure on the stomach on the chest the BOSU gives that lift so you can have a deeper stretch and contract the glutes even more so give those three a try like I said as well slow it down a little bit so you can definitely have the mind muscle connection let round all the way down all right dolphins or the first one and ten reps two three four up and breathe awesome if you need to reset stretch the back out next one are those kicks swimmer kicks lying on your stomach okay both feet are elevated here and squeeze we alternate between the two so we doing ten for each leg total of 20 halfway eight three two and one nice job okay and then remember our last one knees are bent heels are together reminder you have to visualize what you so visualize pushing your heels towards the ceiling you towards the ceiling okay and up one two three four five six seven eight nine one more whoo 10 awesome nice job okay I gonna do all those one more time stretch the back out if you need to grab some water now this last set let we contract the glutes better relax the low back tell this chill even more now that we let legs are straight going for the Dolphins and up and squeeze ten nine eight seven six five for keep the pelvis tilted three here two last one one awesome alternating legs legs are straight up squeeze two three four five keep those legs straight you don these ten halfway nine eight seven six five four three two last one and one alright the last one bend the knees alright pelvis tilted and press three four five six seven eight nine one more excellent nice job okay so let the BOSU from the bench we the bench and a resistance band and a med ball next so no booty lift workout would actually be called a booty lift workout if it wasn thrusts so these are a different version I okay and I I inner thigh and you want it to be pretty high up so it doesn resistant man position yourself out here these are so much harder squeezing into the medicine ball down so keep resisting the band at the same time you you and squeeze same concept here you want to pelvis til when you come up to the top and squeeze the glutes push through the heels squeeze at the top and then we 10 9 8 push through the heels 6 5 4 3 2 1 and we set if you need a second take it we gonna go 10 slow and then pulse for 10 two more sets and go squeeze 10 9 8 7 [Music] three more eight and nine and then we pulsing go ten nine eight seven six five four three two one whoo take a second final round three sets back to back ten slow ten pulses in three two one and go ten nine eight seven six five four three world sir two last one and pull go ten nine eight seven six five four three two one woohoo great job and that was your 10 minute booty lift with Amy Joe my glutes are on fire so reminder that there should always be some staples in a booty lift workout trying to grow the glutes requires force it requires you getting stronger because glutes are the biggest muscle in the body which means they burn a lot of calories they look great obviously that but you have to remind yourself that you to grow so if your your goal is to grow and have rounder tighter harder glutes you definitely have to produce enough force on them to make them grow not that you have to be deathly sore all the time but you do need to be making sure that you I train boots about three times a week some are a little heavier some I more pulses and really trying to create more of a burn out of it so hopefully you guys enjoyed this video and my booty lifting tips join me next time trainer Amy Joe thumbs up comment below and check out athlean-x X for women online to see more of their

How To Trim The Waist (NUTRITION & EXERCISE TIPS)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tX11E2B8wM8	ATHLEAN - X	hi everyone I athl XX for women and today we to talk about how to trim the waist all right let [Music] me so how to trim the waste as you know we need to reduce body fat women have higher levels of estrogen so carrying extra body fat there is going to be prevalent that had a child if you on you and now you also the um debate of you know skin can my skin bounce back to normal um is trimming my waist going to be possible am I going to have to have surgery you know all these things that you definitely question so uh one of my big tips is first of all you want to make sure that your diet is um following kind of a a plan that helps you not just reduce body fat but also sometimes it can be like an internal bloat internal digestion issue um or some of the foods that you be bloating you as well and making your stomach appear a little bigger than it really could be so if you reduce body fat and you body fat down there and you kind of notice even from day to day that your stomach would distend more than others maybe you need to look a little deeper into um what types of food that you that you so a few of the ones that I wanted to just bring up were um I do know that that some sugar alcohols once we get them in our gut um too many of them can definitely cause cause bloating so obviously a limited amount um you know a little in your coffee or a little in a protein bar or um you know something in in yogurt um you know uh one of that or two things of that today I mean everyone really bloat you but um uh reducing that making sure you that can definitely you know produce good results for you number two is dairy some individuals um have you know a they can know obviously you all but some of us might have a little reaction to dairy uh which can cause some some temporary bloating so maybe paying attention to that and um saying okay after I have you know a couple uh you know sources um portions how does my stomach feel how does it look the next day um and that and test ing it out and do making yourself an experiment but everyone is different once again so some individuals could have a lot of dairy and it never affect them but um these are definitely things to at least take a look at the other one is if you take a digestive enzyme um or prob and or probiotic um both of these help digest um a lot of the foods and sometimes we don the enough enzymes in our stomach in our gut uh to actually help digest some of those Foods so it that um you want to look into Maybe adding a digestive enzyme and probiotic to help you absorb and help break down those nutrients as they should be uh the other one is um drink at least one gallon of water a day I think um you know 99% of the population around dehydrated so I think one thing we can definitely Step Up is how much water that we you got to track it sometimes you can track it and then you don track it anymore because you you okay this is this is how I drink water day in and day out and I don need to count any longer but um you know most people have a difficult time difficult time getting a lot of water in so um I would encourage you to see and check see how much water that you drinking in a day that can definitely help reduce the um trim trim the waist um all right and then moving on we going to talk about some exercises so those are kind of dietary things that you can take a look at but one of the exercises that really helps pull in the transverse and I since I have baby number three um is pulling in your transverse this way what you want to do is you want to pull in through the belly button so think belly button here close as you can get it visualize it in your mind so you want to tighten pull in the ABS tuck it in and you kind of even want to pelvis tilt a little you don want to stick this stick your hips backwards you want to pelvis tilt this way and contract down the core and breathe out and then twisting side to side you can go hands up here hands down here twist twist but it transverse abdominis and tightening it and I do about 10 10 of these and then you can even just hold when I stoplight when you night um you know about two to three sets a day start with that and then you can build upon that because that will also help you in your actual core exercises but start there it your core so that will also help slim slim the waist uh the other one is on the ball if you have a stability ball great if not go get one these are great to use super simple you can use this at home do on in in between your Netflix shows right here hands are behind your head pushing your low back into the ball so all you back into the ball and then up and crunch inhale back and exhale forward inhale back and exhale forward okay we remember at the beginning you want to start with that exercise I showed you when I was standing up then you want to add the twist in twist side to side so maintaining that tight transverse you are going to be sore you promise okay here the last one is side to side so here you to the left knee right to right left to left right to right all while you nice and tight like that very first exercise breathe four more tight three two more two last one woo good so invest in a stability ball cuz that really helps support the low back okay and then the last exercise these are Jack knives which are going to use the same arm and going to the same leg okay so everything is down position here hand is above my head and I right leg only pushing that low back into the ground pushing down folding the body in half and I this side five more five Four 3 two last one good and other side reach up over the head going for 10 use your abs to get up five more five four push that back into the pad three two more two last one and one excellent great so there you have it a few of my tips to help slimming the waist I know those of you who actually searched for this

Glutes NOT Growing? (5 GLUTE GROWTH Hacks)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MkfXJh70Ks	ATHLEAN - X	today we reasons why your glute workout may not be giving you the results you [Music] for hey ladies so we all know it of the year of the glute everywhere you look glued this glute that building the glutes let squat and let swear i don peaches like we are just invaded by the peach so today i just want to talk to you guys about maybe what doing your squats if maybe your glutes aren built up like everybody else we seeing on social media there could be some issues happening so we steps the first one is you activating your glutes people have no idea how critical it is for you to activate those glutes so really the goal with the activation exercises is to train the glutes to fire throughout all of your lower body exercises so those muscles are going to become stronger and they for your core and your legs that it sitting all day or you periods of inactivity here are a few activating exercises that are going to get those glutes fired up before you even start your lower leg workout so we have i have three really easy ones the first one is just a clam you can do this banded you put it up over the knees usually um i do anywhere from like 15 maybe like three sets of 15. you and all you just going to raise the leg so we everything activated that whole minimus maximus whole area back there medius all right so maybe 12 to 15 uh two or three sets flip over do the other side another really good one we to stand up we to our ankles and we crab walk you always want to make sure you keeping tension in the band a lot of times i tell people to internally rotate the feet because that get the glutes from the side a little bit more if you target as much as if you minimus medius you got to get those guys kind of fired up too so always keeping tension in the band the front leg is leading so i would just do a couple shuffles back and forth monster walks are good too i like these you just kind of walk forward the back one i like the best just kind of kick your backside out as you kicking it i couple times all right so super easy all you need is a band that things fired up okay so once you been doing that that two your heels are coming off the floor so if you perform a squat so you and you usual and all of a sudden this is happening you may as well just come back up and put that bar back on the rack because that is really going to be a huge issue so your heels are one of the key pressure points during the squat therefore it guys to transfer the force effectively from the ground through the body to the bar so if your heels are off the ground that of you doing the squat so keeping your feet on the ground is essential for optimal balance and strength you want to try to push through your heels that of your squat comes through your heels when you lifting with your heels um yeah it saying it to try to think about stretching first because obviously there coming off which is going to lead into point number three you haven flexibility or mobility that so bad positioning and movement can often stem from inflexible ankles so even like a small offset in the ankle joint can be detrimental to the effects of the anterior movement of the knee joints which can lead to rounding of the back a forwarding tilt of the torso disengaging the glutes and the quads so once again we the squatting in the first place so this is this impacts the efficiency of the movement and it can also hinder muscle development so what were we saying earlier why am i not getting results that could be easily one of them so number three is not developing ankle flexibility so bad positioning and movement can often stem from inflexible ankles a small offset in the ankle joint can be detrimental to the effects of the anterior movement of the knee joint which can lead to rounding of the back a forward tilt of the torso disengaging the glutes and the quads hence that not getting any really good results from doing your squats also this impacts the efficiency movement and can also hinder muscle development like we talked about earlier why are my glutes not growing well that one of the reasons why is because these certain checkpoints throughout your squats aren way to help you get growth where you really looking to get growth so what do we want to do we want to do make uh we want to try to do some mobility exercises um one of my favorite ones is you can just go up to a wall what you going to put your foot not you know fairly far back and you just going to reach your knee towards the wall now if i can heels not lifting i my foot a little bit closer to the wall and now i can reach it and then i where i the back of my the back of my my back of my calf and i of pull that out a little bit farther and i that ankle mobility so those are really good to do the other option that i still do in the gym because uh as doing a lot of gymnastics and track growing up i definitely have some mobility issues through my ankles i can a full squat properly because my heels come off the ground so what i do is i usually grab some little weights at the gym and i just elevate my heels slightly and that to go down into a full squat without comp without compromising my heels coming off so i lifting them up but i so that earlier like i said being able to drive through my heels whereas here when i get in my squat position i really i can here my ankles are not allowing me to really drop any further so that sure you have that ankle flexibility so number four is going to be our knees moving inward knee vulgas knee cave we what this is going to do it leave our joint our knee joints in a vulnerable position so this is typically the result of strong hip adductors located on the inner thighs being overpowered by the weak hip abductors which is the gluteus mini gluteus minimus and gluteus medius so all of this right here so when we going into our squat and this is happening these strong tight muscles are just overpowering these poor little weak guys here so what do we need to do we need to stretch these guys out and we need to strengthen these ones so that something to really think about so we also have a lack of strength in our quads so what can we do we can lessen the weight a lot of times i tell people take the take the plates off grab the bar do all of your checkpoints what are my feet doing what are my knees doing um is my head and chest up are my knees are my elbows tucked in how is my squat even looking before i throwing all those weights on the bar yeah that you guys also narrowing your stance that can help if you your knees um strengthening your hips like i mentioned that the other thing is using bands just above the knees will help so if you put some bands on you here and if your knees are normally collapsing well you is gonna have to think about keeping those knees that the the bands tight by keeping your knees out so it going to kind of train your mind by using those bands and also it strengthen your hips so that be a great thing to do too the bands are just going to kind of help you get your knees where they should be so those are all really critical pieces to think about the last one is short range of motion so for maximal thigh development you want to squat as low as you can you really want to aim to squat at least to the point where your thighs are parallel to the floor or a 90 degree angle you don but just to where you far enough i mean if you fine finding that you you so far well there ankles you know what am i using too much weight where do i just not have the mobility somewhere where i my am i just too weak to be doing this where i should throw all the weights away and just do body weight until i develop the strength so those are

How To Fix Anterior Pelvic Tilt (CORRECT YOUR SWAYBACK!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yarbnC7jyNg	ATHLEAN - X	hey everybody trainer Susan here today I how to correct an anterior pelvic [Music] tilt hey you guys so I anterior pelvic tilt pretty much my entire life it people you could have heard um the phrase sway back um so an interior pelvic tilt is when the front of the pelvis here is actually when it drops when this front part drops and the back of it rises so that to get that anterior pelvic tilt that good old sway back so this happens actually when the hip flexors shorten and the hip extensors lengthen so we got some muscle imbalances happening there um then there pelvic tilt which is actually the opposite so that pelvis here is going to R up and obviously the back part of the pelvis is going to drop down so you get kind of more of like the butt is going to be tucked under so there bunch of imbalances happening with this we have tight overactive muscles that may contribute to the anterior pelvic tilt and those are going to include the glute group um I Group which is going to be in the fronts of the legs here we flexors which are the small muscles in front of the growing area then we those weak underactive muscles that also can contribute to this which is going to be the glutitis group back here the buttocks we at the backs of your thighs and then we are better known as the lower abdominals so we kind of happening that a lot of this a lot of that weakness here then we that are kind of pulling so that we so a great exercise to help correct this they going to show you is right here on the ground so all you have to do is going to mat we ground you bending your knees at about shoulder width apart and there you go just start with a nice flat stomach we our hands off to the side and all we going to think about doing is just lifting up and squeezing our glutes together so I I and I hips the best that I can I of pressing into the ground with my hands and then I and let that relax for a second really squeezing those glutes tight pressing my hips as high as I can to the ground and I ceiling and this feels tough for me because cuz I have tight hip flexors cuz remember what it said about our hip flexors they to be a little tightened and shortened so I really feel like I getting a full extension but periodically over time if we continue to do this those are going to elongate for us so squeezing those glutes together really just trying to get those hips to open up that feels really good on the back too okay so another one that I love doing especially before I do anything at the gym this one is really critical so you for that this is kind of the same concept but it has a little bit more to it so what we just going to put our heels into the ball and what we just a slight movement with your hips so once your feet you in you bringing the ball in towards your butt but you kind of just do a slight rotation towards your face so I rotate my hips towards my face so I kind of doing what my hips are not normally doing so and normally they doing an anterior tilt now I kind of get it going in the opposite direction so I hips up and really squeezing in and what I like about this too is I get just a very gentle stretch on on my back so what another great thing is that it activate those deep course stabilizers those rectus abdominus muscles that a lot of times that can be completely shut off and what that going to set you up for like some major injuries which I did have even though I had a six-pack at the time they were completely shut off because my my back was taking up so much of the grunt of all of the work because these guys were like Hey we anything so my back was just like churning and working and all of the stuff until one day it said I can it anymore so that critical to get these guys activated get those hips uh with a lot of exercises too think about kind of pushing your butt under to protect your back because otherwise if we we if you backload you yourself up for like a minut major injury so these are all great things you can do to just really help prevent any further injury to your lower back okay so quick tips you can do daily number one stop stretching your hamstrings they need to be strengthened along with the glutes so gently stretch out your back the biggest thing I tell people who have back injuries is don back for me stretching my back consists of this I literally bend over I little bit and then I kind of round my back and that that you can do is over stretch your back you guys so be really careful with that stretch out those darn hip flexors super easy one get on the ground um you opposite leg or actually same hand on the on your knee as you out you and then you hip out so I in unison and I through that hip flexor and just pushing that hip out as as glued as tight and I that knee out that get your abs strong focus on those lower deep core stabilizers get them activated before any workout in the gym that first thing you need to do because if you go in and you to squat or I workout and you start you start getting into it and these guys are just completely shut off yeah that setting yourself up for injury okay you guys I hope this was helpful it can be corrected I know um it sounds like a lot but it every day that makes a huge difference hey if you guys haven Max shred program make sure you go check it out we exercises that are science-based you can go for fat loss muscle burning we customizable meal plans that are great the workouts are also Al also customizable that you can kind of just use the template they give you and create all of this stuff for yourself that really individualized thanks for joining me today let soon	Success

Grow Your Glutes Without Weights (IS IT POSSIBLE?)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPCfxFq5iW0	ATHLEAN - X	hi everybody I athlan XX for women and today we doing a discussion can you build your glutes without weights is it [Music] possible okay so we are in this debate can you build your glutes without weights is it possible my honest opinion I give my honest opinion today um I do I do think you can build your glutes without weights um let examples so you have exerciser number one she trained um much at all uh or someone else who has uh an injury or take myself for example who hasn a while um recovering from a third baby uh yes all of those individuals can build glutes not using weight uh because we don have um you know the the foundation of the glutes with enough Force yet that has uh built those glutes over time so beginners individuals who have um are recovering from an injury individuals who um are coming back from uh you know recovering from a baby having a baby uh yes you can increase your glute size and glute strength without using weight then we move on to exerciser number two uh she maybe not a hardcore athlete but she has uh done you know lunges and other squats and exercises if she puts together the right uh strategy and the right exercises yes right at the beginning she could add uh glute strength which adds glute muscle mass so therefore she is now doing exercise es such as um you know a hip thrust that I you in a second or um you know fire hydrants that she hasn she exercises she hasn the exercises that directly Force the glute to grow so therefore that exerciser number two yes can add um glute mass by uh you know not using weight then you have our third and final exerciser who has been doing hip thrust she has been doing all the other exercises um that focus on the glute uh that optimize your training strategy to grow the glutes therefore she going to get enough pressure she going to get enough Force enough weight so to speak by not doing um exercises that don body another body we have a a exact uh pound so when we exercises that lifting every time that you thrusts or or um you know what you fighting when you know fire hydrants but if you that and you already have been doing weight the only way to get stronger is to then lift heavier weight so uh in that individual exerciser she wouldn be she would basically be regressing by not continuing to use weight so it really comes down to what exerciser are you who are you and what has your ex what have your um strategy been to add muscle mass to your glutes so you once you identify that then you can kind of come up with um your plan that would help grow your glutes um I do think that the more that you better so obviously if you want tighter rounder uh buttox uh two to three times a week is optimal I don time a week is enough because it a big muscle group that you can be training them they can be recover and then you can go again especially if you if you remember the stronger you get the equivalent to adding more muscle mass so every time that you exercises you want to be getting you want to be getting stronger um but going back to just the body weight exercises I beginner exerciser can do and even the exerciser number two um that will properly help increase the size of your glutes so I with the band okay we much weight here this is just resistance from the from the band so we abductors okay if you want to hang on to something um even off to the side a bench you abduct out to the side and raising using the glute muscle so anytime that you away from the body or even sometimes towards the body that is going to activate your glutes so lifting there if you haven been doing these once again not using weight you of your glutes okay then you would just switch and do your other side leading with the heel and squeezing your outer glute gluteus maximus up at the top so I would recommend 15 each side and then you the ones that I was just talking to about the fire hydrants okay so you here you coming back down so this is using a band you can also do them without so if you are that beginner this is where you would start knee here lifting the knee towards the ceiling and yes you would feel the glutes burn and you would probably be sore because you haven performing any of those EXC that enough Force to help increase the size of the glute for that beginner and also the exerciser number two the example but the exerciser number three the one who already been doing a lot of this it not enough Force for her so she needs to continue to add weight um to help grow grow her glutes glutes the other one is non-weightbearing okay you up and you here squeezing the glute at the top once again 15 each leg and then you 15 on this leg so you add even just those three exercises in three rounds 15 reps each and there you go exerciser one and exerciser two automatically will have uh glute growth so remember to increase strength that focus on when you your glutes uh those are great three great body weight exercises to implement into your program so hope you guys enjoyed this video comment below like us and check out athleen XX for women lots of great um other programs and nutrition programs to help give you the physique that you bye-bye	Success

4 WORST Flat Belly Fails (AVOID ABS MISTAKES)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SjmFDTieiY	ATHLEAN - X	hey ladies today we about four fails when it comes to getting that flat belly I know here we [Music] go okay guys today we about possibly why are my abs just not getting flat what am I possibly doing wrong so or even if you do have abs why why are they protruding it it of doing everything I should but they still look like they out a little bit so here are four things we need to talk about to hopefully get to the bottom of this because I know it had our major fails so the first thing we doing way too much lower ab training so a lot of times when they when people are thinking about training their abs a lot of the times they focusing on well gosh it belly which number one is the last place to lose fat normally we out here first before we get here so this is kind of the trouble area for most people anyway so that because people are be just like okay well I I just I going to be doing my hanging leg raises until I can see people in there just cranking these out you know rep after rep then they hitting the ground okay now I do my Ling leg raises you know more more lower workout here crank this out okay those are great exercises but if that you and that can actually cause the lower ab to start protruding so it think about all the aspects of your core making sure you too you know your planks your body weight work uh my obliques my side planks all of that stuff is really critical too the next thing we want to talk about is focusing on quality not quantity I see those people in there on the weekends I call them The Weekend Warriors man they are just cranking those crunches out they them off and it it down that objective of all of this you really want to think about Contracting that transverse abdominis first before you moving into the exercise so there lot of Contracting that needs to happen before you actually go into your reps also how are you breathing are you just kind of like holding your breath and at the end you the air out that can also cause your your lower uh abdomen area here to to protrude so like I already have abs but they them in a way that they making them Pooch out by the way they breathing that can really be another huge Factor so those are two to look out quality over quantity slow concise contraction first breathing out as we Contracting at the same time that really going to make a big difference you guys the next one a lot of people don even really think about tight hip flexors so they can really affect everything including your posture so with that with the tight hip flexor height say that three times fast with tight hip flexors it can make your butt stick out and then your belly come out I had trouble with that for years because of all my years of uh track and gymnastics I had this anterior pelvic tilt and my stomach was really pooched out I was like what you know I What that can be another thing too is just making sure that we stretching out those hip flexors especially you know are you sitting all day are do you have super long commutes getting back and forth to work all of that stuff the more we day is allowing those those hip flexors to become Tighter and Tighter so we get up we hit the gym we them out and then that muscle imbalances are going to happen and everything just kind of goes crazy so super easy stretch you can even do it work maybe every half hour every hour you call a high split stance with our leg behind us my heels on the ground I just going to reach up and then I going to kind of lean away from this back leg here since this is the hip flexor I reach up I from it if you have to do a slight rotation or a twisting away to get that to open up that feel all these muscles here getting stretched out do that during the workday do it after you before you get in the car after you get in the car if you got that long commute all of that stuff is going to make such a big difference you guys big time okay and last but not least structural causes a lot of people don you of back pain you find it hard to hold good posture because let know I have lower back pain and sometimes at night I around the house it hold good posture because I actually in quite a bit of pain sometimes so that can really be a factor too some of us may have issues within our hips I know um that if maybe one hip is off that can throw everything off so there may be contributing to a lot of the reasons why we are not able to maybe train properly um so like a lot of rotational exercises can be tougher that for me is a tough one because once again I have a lower back injury and my my spine does not like to rotate if I try doing it it quite a bit of pain so that have to realize you know what are my limitations what do I need to work work on do I need to see a specialist maybe a chiropractor somebody who expertise of what I help get my body in alignment before I really start training it so these are some really good things that we need to address they like this overnight you guys so just really think about a lot of these when it comes to kind of getting those out you know kind of getting that flat belly okay I hope these are helpful uh thanks for joining me hey check out athleen XX for.com great stuff on there follow us on Instagram Facebook they putting up great videos of

How To Squat Correctly (PROPER SQUATS FORM)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQt4xTA8dO4	ATHLEAN - X	everybody so the squat is a major focus of working the lower body and it has the most functional movement patterns but there are some checkpoints so let me show them to you [Music] so many people overlook the most important checkpoints when it comes to squatting so let in our head kind of think about will really wetness go into a squat so we know that the elbows are tucked in the heads gonna be up our chest is out our feet are aligned our toes are going to be slightly pointed out and our knees are going to go out as we go down so that to look here okay yeah but okay that feels about right okay so even when you there going dramatically wrong so I want you guys to go find a stick you can use a dowel I literally found this outside the house and play there on it and we different checkpoints with this so the first one I on the ground so to squat properly you should be square feet are square toes should be slightly pointed out even though they squared off with the stick and when we go down once again we just want to make sure that the knees are going to go out our heads going to be up or chest is out loops are engaged all of that is happening okay so that feels about right my feet are still squared off so this may feel like you right but there problem so what I I going to put this right at my hip level so once I have this at my hips this this should really be square with my feet and my head so those are kind of the three checkpoints but if I happen to just wrote slightly rotate my hips but I keep my head in my my feet all of all of that feels right except for us something so we develop imbalances and it common problem but we may not even know we picture I wouldn feel that my hips were rotating open because if it how would I recognize that happening so I gonna rotate my hips but I to keep everything else straight this might be a little over exaggerated but that what to show you what hips are opening up now if I go down into a normal squat this is what my head squared off my hips have turned and rotated so now I I should be squatting and what happening here look at that look at that right knee so we valgus of the knee happening or the knee collapse here that issue in the future that cost some damage so what we want to do is make sure that we of these three checkpoints that I was just mentioning earlier so a way that we can actually check to make sure that our hips aren due to some kind of muscle imbalance maybe just the way that our bodies built the best thing you can do is take the same stick and you your glutes at the top or actually I even they have to have a stick that we get rid of so when you your stance for your squat you going to think about totally tightening your glutes we those up I just to make a point so we tighten those glutes because what gonna do it square off so now I really feel like okay not square it off because my glutes are making sure that my hips are straight so before every wrap I to think about okay I those glutes because I know that that gonna make everything square off otherwise if I normal slot and I everything guess what happen without me even realizing it because the glutes totally relaxed it just going back in its comfortable position then we go down and oh boy what oh I don of my goal little squats down so I don really think about it until I to have knee problems and oh my hip starting to feel weird well why ain money starting to have ankle problems it injury going to different parts of your body the other thing is is once you completed your squat once that squat is complete feet are squared off my glutes are tight making sure my hips are straight my head is straight and I going down into my squat then I I want to make sure that I extending at the top a lot of times you you know it but you really want to fully extend those hips at the top tighten up that where you can once you here down tighten those glutes at the top really press them in that going to keep your hips Square it off so and just really quickly another issue you can have which you may have noticed with me is my heels want to come off of the ground because I don ankle flexibility or mobility and my ankles I have some injuries there so that makes it tough for me to go into a whole squat kind of keeping all these checkpoints when I because of my ankles it wants to kind of throw me forward it glutes it more of a massive my squat so what I do is a lot of ankle mobility exercises but I also just slightly elevate my heels that deeper squat and keep everything more in proper alignment so for me that of another checkpoint is what happening with my ankles okay you guys I hope these tips were helpful remember those three checkpoints are my feet squared off are my hips squared off and I sit square off with my head how is everything going these are really critical this is gonna save any any future injuries and it make your spots so much more effective for your workout thanks for joining me hey you guys if you haven our new match shred program go check it out it super awesome science-based

FAT LOSS 101 FOR WOMEN | Belly Fat | Bra Fat | Love Handles GONE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGXLoNyMvKg	ATHLEAN - X	hey guys so if you you may have one or all up the problems in these main areas where the body loves to hold on to fat it can either be the belly or abdominal area the chest or that bra line area or those pesky old love handles let phases to hopefully phase all of these out [Music] all right you guys let those three lovely spots that body fat just loves to kind of hang on so let talk about first and foremost nutrition it all body fat issues so with that excess body fat of course we it accumulating through the belly area through the chest the bra line area and through the love handles so that with phase one we want to think about cleaning and cleaning up our diet and trying to eat healthy Whole Foods I know a lot of times talking about diet can be like one of those really tricky things because it lost at what to do but there great information out there but mainly for at least for me I found that eating healthy Whole Foods lots of greens beans if you eat meat a lot of lean proteins lots of water so think about just making substitutions for let how are you eating your lunch are you going out every day pack your lunch but something really healthy you know making sure you you have the time to create healthy meals maybe on Sunday or Saturday you can cook big meals and portion those out so you have good meals throughout the week to eat that can be really helpful so really take a look at that diet because you guys that number one thing you if you want any of this other stuff to change I know it healthy can be really good too as far as taste you know just make the food really tasteful you can still use spices and all that stuff it doesn boring flat food that interesting there your food nutritious and also really tasty okay so first let so initially apps are going to be really hard to see especially if there is a you know a lot of fat accumulated over that you you know however much weight you need to lose you you even turned on so what I phase one you want to think about learning to contract the ABS learning how to activate the app so it gonna be the critical piece and learning to kind of build that stabilization system before we even move on to the other phases so even if you in a chair and just lifting your knees up and kind of thinking okay I think I could kind of feel that in my lower abs or another thing in a chair I people do is maybe just a slight sit up okay I contract you know I still haven that mind-muscle connection yet but you know just kind of getting in touch with your body that gonna be looking for with the ABS that all we so that extra fat in the chest area that off fat usually here or through the straps and the back you that bulging through here so it can be really unsightly so another thing we can think about too until our body fat drops his posture how that can be a huge factor to my postures a little bit better that could also make the area look a little bit better so that think about is our posture but how am I gonna get my posture good I feeling a little tight and maybe my shoulders are a little forward so what we want to think about doing is stretching out maybe the PEC major PEC minor muscles in the front here really easy fast one you guys could do I and all you going to just think about bringing your arms back into an external rotation almost like you baseball and what you you the doorway and I just want you to think about running your arm up and down and walking in a little bit to where you feeling like you good stretch through the front of that chest so what of opening my chest muscle instead of allowing all those tight muscles in the chest to kind of bring me here which isn of compounding the problem if we already kind of having these unsightly you know things kind of fudging out from the extra body fat love handles so basically left handles all it is is just the obliques but just covered with way too much body fat that can be more of an issue for men than a lot of women have it too it spot it likes to just kind of sit and just kind of hang out for a while so with that one that one is really going to be diet critical that going to come in you guys once you kind of start losing that body fat this is where it from this from the sides we really necessarily gonna do too much exercise for that right now we to just focus on our diet to kind of get that cleaned up so now we move into face Q so our nutrition starting to get a little bit better we bit more results we started maybe adding in a little bit more direct training so like would be Abbas we working on some stabilization exercises so with that we maybe just going into maybe a plank or a modified plank so for a modified plank you can be here or you can be down here which might be a little bit tougher eventually here nice tight core so we working on getting the core stabilized working on those deep core stabilizers that you guys Swiss ball situps this is another really good one because once again the ABS aren still you know we activation and kind of learning how to kind of learning how to to feel and crunch them and so with this one we can put our hands here so this is just gonna kind of just give us a little bit of a little bit of just exercise in the front of the ab area kind of teaching us how to sit up and use our ABS but it nothing that we nice is those lower lower abs with that one okay chest so now with our chest once again we hopefully started losing a little about a little bit of body fat we developing a little bit more of the muscles so we push-ups and what we our pushup and if you have to do these on your knees that a push-up and we want to think about really pushing all the way through push-up we through so with pushing all the way through that that surround us muscle the serratus muscle here that the side of our chest that wraps around kind of cooking into our shoulder here so just kind of getting a little bit more through that push single arm chest press you can do that on a bench or on the ground all of this you can either use one or two dumbbells this is just another great way to kind of just start getting some muscle tone in that chest so you can be here and we said you can do this on a bench or if you on the ground it stabilizing for the arms and the body a great way to kind of teach our chest kind of how to start working so that another great what to do so um love handles next front to love handles hopefully and faced you we started seeing a little bit less body fat there by this phase we can actually start thinking about maybe doing some different attitude don exercises like some banded rotational exercises so at this one we going to take a band we about keeping our arms straight out we back to start you always want to think about lining lining the band up with your belly button we come back to start so with these I would say maybe 12 to 15 you around and do 12 to 15 more so now we kind of started doing a little bit of activation with getting some rotation in the next we plank these are great too so what we gonna do is we our side here and we lightly lift up and you can hold this for a count of anywhere from five to ten fifteen to twenty whatever you want to build up to so once again we focusing on that oblique area but we doing a nice isometric hold which builds a lot of good strength okay so now we phase our diet is down to a science we can see all of that hard work we of happy with what we one and two so now what do I do with my app so now with out is we about doing more of a dedicated app training we effective we aspects of our abs anywhere from using here to hours to doing anything from a side plank planking exercises bodyweight exercises weighted exercises who are really gonna hit it and all different directions and you want to think about doing that five to seven times per weight but remember you guys short and effective is what we next just so the body fats been stripped down now we about doing more isolated exercises something maybe is like a bench press or a dumbbell chest press with a little bit heavier weight because now we want to start really kind of getting a little bit more muscle tone by using a little bit heavier weights and you can also do explosive exercises too which is great to even burn off more of that fat so we started using some heavier dumbbell exercises now we can get into more explosive stuff with our flyout push-ups you so all of that stuff this is all going to make a big difference in burning off and strengthening those areas around the bra fat from the Front the back here okay and last but not least those good old love handles hopefully by now they diminish down you can actually kind of start seeing Wow gosh I could I think I can see my obliques now so that reached phase three you can start seeing those obliques so now we start adding in some weighted I slimming isolated exercises one of my favorites is what I call a no oblique trifecta you can do this with or without weight you overhead you plank you sure your fleets kind of stabilized you front 10 to 12 kick outs here and then you hip touches here so we good for those obliques do I do maybe three rounds of those on each side another one standing dumbbell crunch I love this one not only does it work balance but it really it try to hit things in a different way you don just kind of really thinking about crunching my elbow to my e another really good that you guys so here we go three phases you can make it super plausible to get this done it to go home and throw out everything in the kitchen and try to make it work small changes in phase one phase two crank it up a little bit more add in a little bit more exercises with that one phase three you there foods good you results you then uh then you oh my gosh I can easy that is and it really can don you guys make this a super easy plan but hold yourself accountable that other thing you just have to make sure that you for everything thanks for joining you guys if you are still having some trouble ears still a little like gosh I don program it will totally help you because super customizable not only with your workout but super customizable with the diet so that could be another great resource for you guys

Diet Plan for Six Pack Abs (5 STEP PLAN!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6Wfz0sonDA	ATHLEAN - X	hey you guys train your Susan with athlean-x X for women today we talk about getting those six pack apps so we are going to look at an easily laid out five-step plan to get those abs to puff [Music] are you guys we all know that good old diet that those abs I myself have gone through the trenches of trying to figure it out so hopefully today this is a nice easily laid out five-step plan that will make it accessible for everybody to get those abs especially during the holidays and all of that stuff that may be going on okay so first and foremost our number one is going to be cut the crap literally so not only in your diet do you need to cut out all the crap but just kind of all the stuff that goes in your head like yeah I think I okay just going to get drive-through another time or I know I cheat meals twice a week but you know what it worked out really hard those two days so there have to work through but it being honest with ourself to look at the foods that we what food should I have in my diet what foods should I not have in my diet and really making the dedication and step 1 to get rid of those foods whether it excess alcohol there you to kind of start progressively cutting that down in your diet because it really does add up you may not think it alcohol it has a lot of sugars just a lot of other things that are going to contribute to not losing the weight and it miserable if you just kind of keep thinking I can go on the way that I going I work you guys I we all have okay so number two eat more often you that doesn eating more often if I weight and see my abs well going back to step one we if you start eating better foods they gonna process and digest a lot easier so that is going to make you have to eat more often the other thing is you gonna be rewarding yourself with just constantly eating you know crappy foods you you want to think about eating more to feed your body the fuel that it needs to repair itself from the hard workouts that you blood sugar that is a critical piece to all of this you have to keep that blood sugar up throughout the day not only during your workouts but through the night so that meals throughout the day snacking all of that is really another critical piece and it portion size that way you can eat smaller meals but you forward to these little meals throughout the day instead of just sitting down and gorging yourself you know two or three times a day and you you feel miserable it vicious cycle so there are ways to eat more but just not bad foods okay phase number three or step number three ah eat less of the less obvious stuff so what do I mean by that so with this one this is where you that second look of you know what am I really eating here so the goal is to just not have Adam support that new muscle growth with all of the foods that you body so with eating all these healthier foods it little bit more but just like I said earlier that because your your feeding your body the new nutrients it needs the healthier foods that need your getting away from the processed foods with all the fats and saturated fats that are in there so eating less of the less obvious stuff so that really sure what you mean by that okay well let you I okay well it chicken but let healthier out or you know I oatmeal but I packets and it these are kind of those little less obvious changes it them but that kind of eating less of those foods okay all right step number four is going to be this is good eat more of the good stuff so this is where we all of these great new foods into our diets for eating more greens maybe more beans and seeds lean meats and proteins so this is where we start increasing that into our diet because once again we all that crappy processed foods we not getting all those sugars and salts and saturated it bad fats that we bodies that and processed foods so that want to eat more so that load your plates up with big salads you know adding beets and cucumbers all of these really good things that your body is gonna love to eat you ton of protein in there even with greens broccoli all of that stuff spinach is packed with proteins so don you to you guys so eat more of the good stuff all right and our last step number five supplement for consistency so what I mean by that is a lot of times if you having a super busy day and you crap I didn time to pack my lunch I you know I don want to go down to the vending machine I drive-through with the other guys from work that keep your supplements with you it going to give you the nutrients you need the protein you need to just maybe get through until you can get home and you can have a good meal yeah so you may not always have access to those healthy foods so a lot of times it carry our supplements with us because it next level if you out really hard you and you maybe you in because your work you day that thing for before your workouts after your workouts so those are another good thing to kind of keep in that plan of being able to see your abs alright you guys so hopefully this is an easily laid out plan for you these are just baby steps but if you follow them start by just looking at your diet what crap can I get rid of which it initially it may not be super obvious that kind of have to take that second and third look at your diet because a lot of stuff really isn that narrow it down to the foods that are gonna be nutrient rich for you protein rich the good carbohydrates all of that stuff and announced we are going to start seeing results thanks for joining me today hey you guys check out max shred that again helping with diet and it free exercise programs that are customizable to your fitness level and

How To FIX YOUR POSTURE | Forward Neck | Slumped Shoulders | Pelvic Tilt	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjEY-p_85OM	ATHLEAN - X	it we contributes to bad posture and some fixes [Music] okay so posture should be your number one priority you guys before you do any strengthening to your body because there could be happening a lot of times that this is gonna cause what we call a forward head slumped or routed shoulders or rounded back and then we that pelvic posterior tilt so this is gonna start happening a lot of times if we doing before we start any kind of weight training so what we need to do is we need to kind of look at each one of these what can we do to fix them maybe what are some weird habits that might be happening to cause that so the first thing we rounded upper back so that of when we kind of getting almost like this C shape the shoulders are kind of rounding forward we inhibited muscles here we shortening happening we muscles through the back so one of the habits that a lot of us could be doing is just slumping so I always tell people stop slumping at work if we computers I was there I worked in the corporate world for a long time people would come by and they you didn only takes 20 minutes of this for your body to kind of freeze up and love that position so then you get up from your desk and you room and you day then you get to the gym and maybe you don yeah but you do back day and you haven done any searching and you PAP doesn bigger because you like everything that what do I have that what my shoulders throughout the day because there something and I over and it so just try to do that next we can do what so you can either use a full roll like a foam roller or for me I use a half I can yet because the goal with this one is you want to put it underneath your shoulder blades so you your shoulder blades so about right here and you want to go into like a thoracic extension with this one you want to think about getting those shoulder blades open your arms up the butt needs to stay on the ground and the goal is to try to touch your head and your hands to the floor without lifting your butt so I thumb roller right now because I do have rounded shoulders I have all these who that I it and I great candidate to show you what you don most people are lucky enough to already be able to use a full foam roller under the shoulder blade so what you don want to do is this you what you let should be on the ground but see if I can should really look like because your head and hands should pretty much be on the ground so that get that forced thoracic extension so if you with a half one that progressively move up into a bigger one like this but it up thoracic area where we doing that and not kind of forcing herself into that so that do it let gonna do a little bit of a strengthening so once we that we thoracic extension we strengthen we a tea hole super lightweights these are threes you can do three five you we a nut once again we thoracic extension we these dumbbells out we our thumbs back we press through to try to open up thoracic area and we can hold for anywhere from four sets of thirty seconds so once again you those snubs attack bring those shoulder blades together [Music] so what are we doing there we stretching out those tight muscles in the front and we those long gated muscles in the fact that are a little bit weaker that are allowing those those shoulders and that back to kind of round and slump forward okay so next now we look into more of the shoulder rounding so we background in so then you kind of that shoulder rounding and a lot of times this is really just a consequence of a rounded thoracic spine also adapted shortening which once again is going to be in your chest so what we a couple months ago and if you somebody like me who has all of this I it was really hard for me to feel like I was actually engaging the muscle because it just so out of it so when you do face pulls you want to start with the lighter weight while lidium rep you guys that really even if you four reps I don with this is to get that mind-muscle connection of how am I gonna feel this do my back when it kind of on vacation so what we do is we system or you can do these with bands we make it my handles right here once again I pull this towards my face but I thinking about bringing my thumbs up and my shoulders together face and back so I normally just try the best that I can to get that thoracic area to open see how I squeezing those shoulder blades together really really pulling it had still even a little bit of an uncomfortable mood for me there we go so with that we pulling out her face we want to think about bringing our thumbs back so think about two handles and pulling bringing the thumbs back that right at our face you can really feel that engaging in the back that most so we need to bring together and really strengthen okay so next we gonna talk about the forward neck issue so let the forward note there are so many intricate little muscles in there but once again it we to be long and weak and we these shortened tight muscles that are going to be happening and that gonna cause that neck to start protruding out front so there easy fix for this one what you do is you we lean exercise so what we we wall we our shoulders back because any of us and have that rounded back rounded shoulders as I stand here that like they comfortable so I kind of bringing those back a little bit I want my head not looking up not really tucking my chin just to neutral head forward I head is gonna be back up against the wall and then I a foot out from the wall my shoulders are now off at the wall my ears should be over my shoulders my head is back up against the wall and what right now so I work right now so I some of those tight muscles and I strengthening those with your muscles and I minutes so this is some kind of a light exercise we are just here for you know a few seconds you need to hold this for about three minutes once you with that you you can really feel a big difference I really felt those muscles back there working so it you can do anywhere okay next we going to talk about that good old pelvic tilt so mister pelvis down here so why does he progressively go into that posterior tilt well because he this craziness happening up here we got all of these imbalances everything completely out of whack our neck is here our shoulders are rounding so that the pelvis is like well gosh what do I do okay well I got a tuck under because I trying to carry all this you know chaos that is another so it little chain effect the kinetic chain is just getting kinked all the way down so and another thing that is our hamstrings are gonna start shortening because what have we is tilting wonder our hamstrings are going to start shortening so then we just basically kind of you know looking like we happen I have seen 20 year old guys in the gym that have all of these things happening to them so it really does happen you guys and I know it kind of take a look at our own posture or fess up to what we have like I had to finally say oh my gosh I ever buckle ders I have a lot of this stuff going on and it we can fix it and that goal here today so the solution to try to help that posterior tilt we to just try to stretch it out a little bit so what we what I what we find a little bit of a rise I try to start stretching those hamstrings out a little bit so I think about flexing my foot I keep my legs straight I about just slightly leaning forward this is for you and think about putting your pelvis into a anterior tilt which is going to be opposite this is posterior-anterior it is easier for me because I already have that and then we about reaching forward and stretching stretching that hamstring out so we just reaching sitting back and you sweet spot oh and boy it that leg but that we really have to start doing is getting a really good stretch on those hamstrings so once again if you sitting all day long commutes all of that stuff think about getting those stretches in it here and work its way down all right you guys so working on all of these changes it happen overnight a lot of us could have you know been like this since we were kids and we just kind of grew up with all of these things already happening and we maybe never address them when we started working out or doing sports and it just kind of amplified all of these different things that are happening in our body but it are all correctable you can do it on your own with a lot of these exercises and just being aware that it in your body that you guys go to it get that body straightened out just be patient it takes a little time thanks for joining me today hit the like

7 Best Dumbbell Exercises for Women (FULL BODY WORKOUT)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0xMU-_OLVA	ATHLEAN - X	Hey ladies today let seven of the best dumbbell exercises you can do to get a great full body workout [Music] you guys so my dumbbells dumbbells are great because you can use them in small spaces they gym they you have to take them to the office a lot of times trying to use a big bar bill can get really tough plus you can do a lot with them there exercises a lot of balance work there just so many good things so why don start with exercise number one this is gonna be a dumbbell curl and press so now with a lot of these you can either choose a heavier weight if you looking to build if you want to use a lighter weight maybe you just want to tone and strengthen then you can go a little bit lighter okay so we going to hold our dumbbells here I always put mine in front of my legs here because that makes me get a full adequate curl a lot of times people are out here and I feel like this way I not cheating as much it me use that bicep we that and then we into a press and down here so this is a great bicep movement and shoulder movement so we pool to a press we press you want to keep a nice tight core with this too especially once you get to the rotation that really gonna have to take in I almost kind of do a little bit of a pelvic push forward and really tighten my abs just protect my lower back okay so we we and back to start so with these I usually do a grouping of anywhere from depending on how heavy and lifting anywhere from 12 to 15 reps for three rounds I usually use this as a finisher after my shoulder workout I love that it next getting on the ground we add some weight or perhaps a lot of times it weight while we you have a super strong core then I would recommend not adding any weight I would just go through the motion here without any weight because that workout for your core or for your lower abdominals so otherwise grab you know it doesn the guy of two towns here you gonna start and with these I do sometimes I do a wide leg because that hits a little bit more of my oblique as I roll my ABS down or I keep my legs together and that hits a little bit more of the front but the goal with this is to always keep your arms straight and up overhead as you can roll your apps up and then you tucking and rolling back so these this extra weight here is just taxing those ABS a lot more than it would be without having any paper so this is a great building exercise but the key to this one is making sure that you it rolling up you back under that it that up it ground and then using your arms pushing okay that that okay with that one again depending if you from maybe twelve to fifteen reps with that one three rounds and I usually just take a quick maybe 10 15 second rest and then I go into my second round right into my second set okay next we to go into tapping rows this is probably one of my favorite back exercises and this one you can probably go a little bit heavier so this is going to involve a lot of core work too so you gonna stand what we gonna lunge down and we weights and we and grow so the key with this one is always making sure that you the ground you are tight my back is straight I bringing my shoulder blades together and tapping so I usually maybe do 12 I take a bit of a break and then you want to make sure you then I leg I neutral head I and row tap row so we staying low the whole time but we really working everything right my quads are really working right my abs are working to keep my body straight keeping my head straight and that she was a better so really good we shoulder workout or I workout with that that can probably go a little bit heavier with those okay dumbbell thrusters these are great for basically full-body we gonna be hitting our quads hamstrings glutes shoulders core is involved so you you the ceiling you want to think about pressing through your heels to generate that momentum to help you get the dumbbells up so we press [Music] so now for me if I filming it through my legs but I not necessarily feeling it through my shoulders not swimming to think well maybe I need to go heavier a little heavier weight because I obviously have the momentum do you get those up pretty fast so I would probably run into something a little bit heavier to challenge my shoulders so you can also think about that but if I wanted to just make it that more metabolic I stick with a lighter weight because that way I can do more of them for a longer amount of time and really get my heart rate up so there one you guys okay Swiss ball one iron chest press all right what I love about this one I balance that part that a lot of times you people on the bench kind of doing their dumbbell bench press we just find curve into the bar barbell press which is great but I think this is just kind of another great way of involving the entire body so my shoulders are on the ball my hips are up I for balance what I love about this is it drops the shoulder down naturally so I of motion and then I that up to the ceiling almost a little bit over the front of my body - that muscle in here a little bit more my glutes are tight and engaged and that all right so depending on your weight 12 to 15 reps 3 3 rounds all right so we really hitting everything so far ok another one of my favorites I do not see enough people doing these gym those good old lateral lunges but we some weight to them so you take a dumbbell you like this and what we we and back up here step off back to start so when I about hinging at my waist and really sitting back through my heels that way my glutes are fully engaged and I pressing up and getting kind of a quick little explosive press off the floor then you can get a nice kind of back and forth rhythm going here with these so with these I reps total take a quick rest on to the next one work those laterals you guys I I haven seen many doing laterals in the gym do them they have no idea it builds out it works the sides works your glutes really good all right last but not least swing 90 jumps okay swing nighty jump this is very metabolic let once again use whatever weight you feel comfortable with you it by the top you starting into a low squat you swing the dumbbell we create a 90 degree angle we come back to start so we swing swing swing and the swing whoo so a little bit of motion there just try to get as low as you can into those swings you whoo all right you guys I love these exercises because number one they hitting every part of our body they testing a little bit of our balance they different range of motion planes of motion all of that stuff so add these into your workout if you if you are going to be great for kind of Kabaddi not changing it up hitting the muscles in a different way thanks for joining me today you guys if you check out our Mac shred program let you you a beginner it it it has a diet section totally

Lose Your LOVE HANDLES In 4 STEPS (Totally Doable!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgQHbmSX0s	ATHLEAN - X	hey guys trainer Susan with athlean-x X today I for losing those pesky love handles and for doable steps [Music] all right you guys those good old love handles we know we know we know they just like to kind of set up for hang out there and just kind of like make your life miserable so the first step I know it but we all have to just be honest with ourselves and hold ourselves accountable we have to clean up our nutrition I know I know you don don video yes nutrition nutrition nutrition I it past to just kill my abs in the gym while still kind of what I thought was eating healthy but in the long run it just never happened so we can look for any magic exercise pill that gonna get us to our goal because unfortunately it the other thing is is a lot of times maybe you what you least not on a consistent basis so that is we really are not going to lose the way we need to unless we caloric state from wherever the point of where our maintenance is so that another thing but we really really really really have to kind of have a meeting with ourselves sit down open the refrigerator open the cabinets what going on what am I really eating what do I need to get rid of what do I need to add I know it once you kind of start getting rid of those foods that are kind of your cravings especially the sugars because boy sugars that add wait on you guys I know it just try to think of substitutes for some of your favorite foods I know there so check it out but number one nutrition okay number to increase your out training consistency so along with your cleaner diet number two think about doing your abs six to seven times per week you don have to be in there for hours at a time just make it short but intense make it effective really make sure every rep is quality it the times number 3 train your obliques yeah don say you know I say oh my gosh you know you shouldn doing those you blocky looking it was like really and I I don block so hopefully not but what we really think about with training the obliques is they really aren Train because that us that nice and V taper that gonna get that nice cinched in look so when you one thing that I try to think about or what you should be thinking about this train train by following the fibers of the obliques so the obliques are here on the side so they take up a pretty pretty good you know chunk of our core here and the fibers are just gonna kind of follow in this pattern on the sides here they so it here so if we think about kind of following the fibers that no hope you know build them out too much but it in so I quickly an exercise you can do with just a band if you have it hooked on something high and what you is you with a straight arm and we to think about doing a little bit of a road so if you grab the band we to bring it down and end so following that fiber here because it kind of starts high and sweeps in that we we bring this down and just rotate with that oblique and I crunch at the end here so I feeling that work but I those natural fibers of how it wants to be worked okay so if you look at the fiber orientation of the external obliques you the line and the band are gonna line up so that where I up at the fibers so really good maybe 12 to 15 reps on each side obviously return do the same thing lined it up with the fibers here and you rotate kind of down and in where you can really feel that obliques getting some work done okay number four another really critical piece is doing full-body training I mean it to hit your abs and you know clean up that diet but you really want to make sure you workout this in conjunction with everything else is really going to make a good plan for success so by training your entire body with great training and cardio this is going to help you put on that lean muscle mass and burn that overall body fat because that these love handles are it excess body weight and that tends to store away store in areas where that gonna lose the way to unfortunately sometimes we lean out you know in our arms and maybe in our legs but then we trouble areas

kind of consider myself a little bit more functional based I like to do stuff that exercises because it imbalances but they still give you really good results so I you five of my exercises that I doing more of lately that I really like that I feel like I good results with and I hope you do too okay the first one we with is a dumbbell single leg squat raise so this one you can either do on the ground for beginners or to make it a little bit more challenging you can do it on a bosu I I like doing it on a bosu because it balance we ground it unstable environment okay so start out with however much weight if you want to start out a little bit lighter cuz this really is a full oneel leg squat what I love about this one too is it really focuses on the gluteus Min Minimus and Maximus more on the side of the glute here which is always a good thing I mean it really hits the whole thing but it really targets those that don just being here okay what you to do is you in the opposite hand you leg this leg is going to go out as you go down so we reach the dumbbell towards our foot and we want to think about our tracking too and the other thing is you always want to make sure you at the waist first you don straight down I always tell people you want to hinge a little bit first before you go down into that squat hinge kicking those hips back cuz that that glute activated and doing the work that it should be doing all right so for more of the advaned you like I said you that bosu find The Sweet Spot and you going to do the same thing you just going to reach for the foot and come back up it little bit tougher cuz you working your balance at the same time so just think about really getting as low as you can that the key with this one is getting this dumbbell basically touching the top of your foot that means you squat all right move that out of the way okay box single leg Taps these I like to do pretty much closer to the end of my workout these I feel like are really good for just kind of burning burning out the glutes so after you what good uh the higher the Box the tougher it be the goal with this is just to tap and slightly lean forward that I on my waist because then that in turn is going to keep my glute basically doing all of the work so and the the key too with this is just a tap we coming down and resting and coming back up this is not a step up I always tell people think of a hot plate down there and you tapping some balance issues today so you and you want to keep a good Pace I usually do 15 to 20 of these three on each side and up so you can really see that it the blast burnout okay next we single elevated leg squat so with this one once again you going to use any kind of box or anything you may have have I this is anchored uh you can use um a barbell you can use dumbbells if you don barbell I just have been using a barbell lately doesn what we going to be on the bench we at the waist first but we to lower down and back St we want to make sure that our foot is tracking too so we a squat as we possibly can but this is really focusing on that one glute and up and back to the top all right so maybe 10 to 12 15 depending on how much you are really good though I love those it a nice way to kind of Hit the glute in a different way all right next my one of my favorites Bulgarian split squats you can use a plate dumbbells I prefer a plate we going to put our back foot on that bench I like a plate because it keeps my head up we knee as close to the ground as possible the other thing is is you want to keep a closer stance the farther out you are the more that glutes I to keep your stance a little bit more narrow so I down that back knee to the ground and then I that coming or the squat is coming from is from pressure and pushing up through the heel so those you can do 12 to 15 on each side three rounds okay all right some really good glute exercises okay another one of my favorite finishers is explosive of long jumps it doesn but it it definitely is so with these what you hallway I usually wait till it clear at the gym and then I go for it you you I between and then push forward so it and using the GL glutes to project you forward so you here so I me forward so if you the way down a hallway you feel your legs when you done so staying nice and low and using those glutes as your power source all right you guys these are five super great GL exercises what I love about them is that they obviously can be done at home you don these super heavy barbells and you know back loading all this stuff if you need to do that that other ways to work your glutes without always having to lift super heavy or be at the gym that thanks for joining me today you guys check us out on social media check out our new Max sh

How To Lose ARM FAT (The TRUTH & Best Tips!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kc8BUeB14cg	ATHLEAN - X	hey guys I athlean-x X for women and today our video is focusing on how to lose arm fat I have some tips I have some exercises and let [Music] all right so losing arm fat we all know that you cannot spot reduce spot reducing is when you want to focus on just one area to reduce the fat thereby doing lots of crunches to reduce your belly fat or doing lots of leg extensions or lunges just to reduce the fat on your legs well number one genetics rule also you understand that the way that you lose body fat is the way you so nature versus nurture right so obviously what how you were born and in the genetic traits that you have dictate how you lose body fat so everyone is different and so that into well I want my arms to be leaner well that tend to hold on to body fat more than other areas and somebody else might have a different part that yours is leaner than than theirs so the one thing that you can do is focus on lowering your body fat altogether just because that really where you leanness that you is key but also weight training is key as well because the more muscle mass that you have number one dictates metabolism and also can help you to reduce body fat but also if you do have an area that you want to even maybe a peer leaner well a straighter muscle versus a area that has a little more muscle mass and curve and shape to it that even if they percentage so adding muscle mass to that exact area can also help it appear leaner because you have more shape there than it just being let and down so that important so you want leaner arms yes we want to reduce body fat but in the meantime while you that be sure to lift heavy so you can add more shape to the bicep and the tricep so a few of my exercises that are real simple and we all know them to be true but honestly I think a lot of us don you not going to increase strength which means if you don strength you muscle mass so therefore you spinning your wheels so making sure that even on a seated one you want to feel like look you can get to eight eight to ten and it because if you every exercise every time that you coming back to the gym to do arms again then you these for me I eight to ten for me and I go nice and slow you want to be slow on your negative and positive one count up to count down and I to ten on those so those seated number one you can standing up I can swing and use a little momentum to get the dumbbells up being seated ensures that my core has to be strong but also my biceps have to do all the work so make sure that you heavy enough and I love doing palms up on the bicep curl because I feel like it recruits the thickness and the peak versus necessarily your hammer curls so yes mix it up but you know if you are limited on time definitely do the traditional palms up because it to hit majority of the bicep heads the two heads so we one and this tricep is double double the fun you use your plate and you arrow press on these so elbows are in narrow press and then you skull crusher or overhead extension same name and extend over the head so this one same thing you want to make sure you go heavy enough eight to ten really isolate the triceps when you extending back think of a hinge on a door and then elbows in press up so one press and one extension is one rep eight to ten make sure it elbows in and press elbows in and press and finish with the extension so those are two great exercises I would do each one eight to ten eight to ten and then I four sets and if you really adding some muscle mass in the biceps and triceps definitely consider adding a second day during the week of hitting those muscle groups because also the more blood and the more muscle fiber that you a week it more blood shoved in there you want those muscle fibers being torn more often so two times a week going that heavy and not doing too much volume so making sure that you know if I those heavy exercises I between before I go again and not doing so much volume that you know you able to actually lift heavier weight so those are a few of my tips remember no spot reduce singing lift heavy weights if you in strength you muscle mass leave us a comment below let me know any other questions that you guys have hopefully this video was helpful for those of you who want to get leaner arms thanks for joining me I trainer amy joe-- we time	Success
#1 AB WORKOUT MISTAKE (Fix With One Tweak!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysEXOKGQad4	ATHLEAN - X	hey you guys so is your ab workout actually making you look fat let about the mistake many of us make in our ab [Music] workout hey you guys so did you know there breathing when you workout that will help you achieve your goal by flattening your belly out so breathing in properly can lead to an extended relaxed belly making it actually look fatter so my goal is to teach you how to do breathing so you can achieve the goal you to achieve which is going to be a flat cinched in stomach so also we need to kind of get out of the mindset that doing an ABW work is going to be enough that that going to combat all the fat um even if you know you to lose you doing all these ab workouts but I still not really losing any weight my stomach really isn but when you really think about it your ab workouts may be burning 30 40 50 calories tops so it moving enough muscles to get any significant caloric burn to kind of lose that body fat so an ab workout alone will definitely not make a significant enough um change to to your abs no matter how consistent you are so there a few things you training like do not train your obliques I mean people say this all the time oh my gosh don into a block it really blocky so it your waist and yeah that is totally wrong absolutely wrong I advocate for uh training the obliques I actually have an oblique day where that actually going to give you that tapered look especially when it really good nutrition plan because then you so do not be afraid of training your obliques so as far as the breathing the the thing you do not want to do is you don doing your exercises it skill you it you make the mistake of crunching up and then breathing out so what that actually pushing out the lower part or my belly at the bottom I can feel that when I crunching and then I just feel like it distended feeling look like it actually making it like fatter than it should be I mean it feels it actually feels kind of weird so what we want to do is make sure that when we we really want to try to engage the transverse abdominis muscles beneath it that in as we exercises you should be doing the exact opposite of what I was just showing you of kind of crunching in and then breathing out so what we want to do and it does get harder when you exercises it is going to be harder that learn this breathing technique with just kind of the basic exercises before you start getting into like really technical exercises is okay so what we is you can still talk normally you can kind of still do all of this stuff but you just making sure that you out and cinching in at the same time that is the key you guys that we you do this you flatter stomach even if you lean and you have abs you can still kind of get that relaxed look if you breathing breathing in properly and teaching the muscles to kind of get this you know stretch out just you know disengaged look of just looking kind of puffy all right so when you ground what we doing is if we basic crunch we before instead of crunching and then blowing where I feel like my stomach pushed out this is where we want to make sure that we at the same time so I about my breath leaving as soon as I start to sit up and back down and back down and I cinching those stomach muscles tight now that I feel like my abs are actually laying flat and they what they should be doing those transverse abdominal muscles are working the way that they should be just get on the floor do the couple variations that I showed you and you you can feel the difference with with those two different variations so kind of what of this so think about doing your ab workout maybe six to T seven times a week you want to keep them short but intense that along with the Healthy nutrition plan is really going to support that overall um effects of training your body making sure you body in conjunction with your ab workout so you you workout while getting that full body workout in okay you guys I hope that was helpful thanks for joining me today hey if you guys haven sh program make sure you check it out they incredible program it science-based it matter what your fitness plan is is um let diet they completely laid out for you guys it great cuz you can kind of pick and choose what you want to eat you can swap Foods out if you want to lose a little bit more fat really great program it our Max shred program thanks for joining me hit the like button subscribe if you haven	Success

butter - that you have chicken vegetable soup maybe about a cupful or a can or however you get your chicken and your soup and a bottle of water that okay so the people who are gonna do a swap on that same day instead of having this you vegetable soup we the potato we mixed green salad with that and your bottle of water alright so here we are a couple hours after lunch a great snack would be some hummus really good for protein you can just have whatever kind of raw vegetables you want times I spoke with the hummus on it otherwise you can do carrots broccoli or whatever and have your hummus however maybe you know take a good scoop full and more water so we hydrated during the day we flushing out all those toxins in your body and the last thing we is dinner so people who are just kind of doing the regular dinner you eating a 90% lean ground beef meatball whole-wheat pasta this is tomato sauce with fresh spinach and you can do a grated mozzarella cheese and a glass of water so that that you if you and you for that same dinner is now going to be cubed chicken still the whole-wheat pasta we gonna do sliced tomatoes with some spinach and we on this one and you glass of water so if I really were just kind of removing like we said before we maybe higher caloric foods for the swamps okay and last if you before bed this is a great one you can do some air-popped popcorn with a little bit of cinnamon and sugar if you have a little bit of a sweet tooth and you can do a glass song with that so wow that some really good healthy foods to eat throughout the day I can anybody going hungry with any of these so once again all the people who are going to be doing 3 swamps per day would be up here that would be your swap meals including your snacks let only doing one swap a day you can pick gosh which what am I going to swap out today I think I dinner so I gonna do these so look that really great about it you can kind of customize your meal plan for maybe how you you want to eat okay so remember refer back to the guidelines as you begin to drop body fat and adjust the numbers and thus and the Shred swaps accordingly because they are going to shift with the more body fat that you you guys so make sure you check out our new match shred program you from all the most current science science-based exercises and the tips from the fat loss and building muscle with this program they with these programs I checked them out recently and it was really cool especially the eating the build plans so and the workouts are all customizable based on your fitness level the same thing like I told you with the meal plans totally customizable that so great about it thanks for joining me today you guys I hope you enjoyed all of this I hope it helps you out with your eating and I	Success

How I'm Getting Back In Shape AFTER PREGNANCY (Welcome Back Amy Jo!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnzuJakMFSw	ATHLEAN - X	hi guys I athlean-x x4 women welcome me back right I just had little jet my third boy and I wanted to discuss today with you guys a little bit about how I am attacking getting my physique back who [Music] with the face of frustration let me tell you it is hard it is tough and I will be completely honest it is a lot of juggling and trying to find balance once again after having two and then you go to three and now you any any mom trying to come back it like I think number one that I really had to do was just set my mindset to be patient and also realize that baby and your family I mean that does come first so if you are focusing too much on you know what you need to do for your physique and how you need to be eating and now I didn you know other things sometimes do take precedence and I think if you start with that mindset even when you pregnant or you know an individual who just trying to get weight off and you got a large family to feed and take care of and you a full-time job give yourself some some grace but also at the same time you know we do have to carve out time for ourselves so I really set a goal at the beginning of my comeback is to say okay if I can get 30 minutes in today you know if I can get 20 minutes in that is that know I feel more energized and I am every single time I exercised I kinder to even myself in my own thoughts so I think one of the biggest things has to start there it has to start in your mentality and giving you all these other tips about eating vegetables or drinking water other things that compare to you know understanding that that life is much more than just your physique so I just wanted to lay that out first and give a little heart to heart for those moms or anybody out there like struggling and combating finding balance finding that time for yourself so it doesn digging your heels in and trying to carve that time out for your you do deserve it so moving on number one one of the things that I have felt like I that is every night I think okay I kind of want to finish dinner and visualize juani like wanting a little bit more food but not so I don but I do have that thought and I you know what that working for me so I like to eat a substantial dinner with lots of vegetables you know I eat about 4 to 5 ounces of protein usually a healthy fat with it and then I could definitely have something else right now but I don and so that thought kind of crossed my mind I that kind of based off of how I necessarily even calculating you know what my dinner was consisting of but just that thought there and going to bed saying I could have I could have had maybe something else but I didn that thing that has really worked for me is to set my mind on I weights I been pregnant for nine months now I recovering for six and you know you lose a lot of muscle mass you lift as heavy because you don much energy you deep range of motion and you to get the consistency in either so I definitely said I need to just lift I need to get back my muscle mass and I need to just put cardio aside number three I use I do believe in using fish oil and I think that me and you know supplements and vitamins and minerals it really the number one thing is what do you need personally because it has to be customized everybody needs something different but I really feel like for me fish oils is a huge one it not only it helps my mood I feel like I have more of a consistent mood I not getting in those omegas all the time and nor am I getting them from flax or other individuals other areas so I really feel like that and number four is sleep oh boy that that a big one to tackle it know when you you know waking countless nights that you are woken up and that does affect your hormone levels it does affect leptin and ghrelin which are the two hormones that can kind of increase your appetite and make you want to snack more throughout the day so I encourage you there to just keep working on the sleep and give yourself some grace as well because the days that you don be a lot harder to stick to you know a nutrition plan or making sure that you calories on those days so I really you know focus on getting naps I know I moved my baby to his room at about I would say seven weeks eight weeks I moved him to his room so he was in his crib so I wasn noises that one really helped me and then also having a really good baby monitor like the video ones that really helped as well because it put my mind at ease and I could even relax because even once you put baby to bed sometimes your minds just like racing like is he okay is he something crying you know so having a good video monitor is really important and and also just the support of my husband has been incredible so asking him for help and asking him to you know wake up for the baby but he he know just making sure that you have support when you need it and asking for help is really really important so I would say that those are probably my my top four right there so hopefully this helped you guys and you know either if you and feel a little overwhelmed or you coming back from a baby as well but I still I for joining me you guys in my journey leave some comments below questions below athlean-x X for women does have really great nutrition programs that not meant to starve you is not meant to you know have you be eating just vegetables and and chicken all day it does encourage balanced healthy portions and it gives you the

Grow Your Booty At Home (JUST DUMBBELLS!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQSIzedpEvk	ATHLEAN - X	everybody its trainer Susan today we gonna work on growing that booty at home and all you dumbbells okay guys today we focus on working on the glute muscles everybody those glutes built up so you can actually still do that at home if you have some dumbbells you see I just have a couple making up a little bit on the heavier side since we are gonna try to kind of blast that muscle get it to grow and so why don first exercise it reverse lunge to knee up so what we going to do is we two dumbbells and how you position these this you put them on your shoulders you gonna try to get them the top of the Bell kind of on the top of your shoulder and what we to just start with our feet about shoulder width apart my abs are going to be nice and tight and we to take a nice step back so we to go back into a nice deep lunge I going to kind of put my hip back to where I hitting and then I up into a big knee race here so a deep step back raise so just really think about sitting back and I this side so you just think about really engaging that glute this leg house we have someone like that troublemaker this is mine we step back and kick up so really trying to make sure we making that glute do all of the work so with this exercise you can do 10 to 12 reps depending on how heavy the weight is three rounds okay second one we going to do a single leg slider back lunge so I dumbbell a little bit on the heavier side to my slider it the same side that I or actually I want to hold a slider the weight in my non-moving like so this is going to be here so we a slider on our opposite leg as hand we head and chest up we that same motion but we our legs straight as we go back so we going to go down and all the way up I going to turn this way because I just realized so I weight is gonna be back on that glute and then I here so I head and my shoulders are up and I really trying to press through that glute as I and pulling up it set targets an entire gluteal area out there okay next we just a low box you can or you could even if you don home you can really use anything if you have like a big book just something clear the ground a little bit I take a moderate weight you to just stand in the middle whatever you have and we box one leg squat to kick out or like leg swing so what we is dropping the weight down to our foot and coming back up so the other opposite leg is going to be kicking out as this leg is really working that glute this leg we can because that more that medial side of the glute which is a really tough one day hit so go to different angles you guys can hopefully see a little bit better I so from here I kicking my backside out coming straight back up dropping straight up so I gonna think about that leg also really kicking out to the side so once again that leg is kicking out to the side I trying to keep my head in my chest up I we coming up this one is an absolute gloom targeter it will get your legs extremely sore because I again each on how heavy the weight 10 to 12 reps three rounds stick to one leg I usually try to complete all three rounds on that particular leg because I feel like it just it what we want to do we just really want to max that muscle okay yes we to go into single leg squat to deadlift I love a lot of single leg training unilateral training I think it important because our legs can be there if you have one leg that weaker you can kind of pinpoint it make you maybe do some extra sass if it little bit weaker than the other side so what we just going to stand on one leg we gonna think about once again dropping straight down keeping our head and chest up the best we can so we like we raise up once you straighten that back leg out rotate your dumbbells keeping them close to your leg and you of your glutes so this is what it going to look like we come up straighten that back leg and we deadlift here so just think about rotating the dumbbells with each individual movement really sit back those weights as close to the ground as you as you possibly can pushing through your back here heels try to push through the Front and drive with your glutes all right so three rounds on each leg before you move forward laughs we little bit more metabolic which is always good and I intend to do this again some of my workouts we a single arm overhead snatch branagh have our dumbbell here our feet are gonna be a little bit wider than shoulder width apart with these you gonna lower slow but then you want to use the force from the feet all the way up to the ceiling so you here and you bring that dumbbell up explosively as quickly as you can but you back and you about using those legs to drive into the ground explosively use that power drive that dumbbell up and overhead keep it close to your body you don drive it out you want to keep it as close to your body as possible to protect your shoulders so driving really using a lot of that power those are great finishers those I would even do more I would probably do maybe 15 even 20 reps wait 10 seconds switch your arm go into your second third even fourth round of those but you do four in it because you want to make sure you get both legs whoo all right you guys you can get a great workout at home to focus on those glute muscles you don heavy bells and then squat rats a lot of these exercises are extremely targeted that the key to growing your glutes is making sure they making sure you activate them before you start your workout spend five minutes doing banned walks even just standing on a wall doing you know kickbacks anything to just kind of get the glutes firing that better than if you not activated and just shut it shut off okay you

How To Get a Smaller Waistline (DOÂS AND DONÂTS!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSzgJptAvuQ	ATHLEAN - X	everybody trader Susan with athlean-x X for women today we talking about the do a smaller waistline [Music] hey guys so getting a smaller midsection requires consistency accountability and a willingness to invest in your health that goes way beyond just your waistline but increase your overall longevity so today let good to do and maybe some things that aren obviously foremost we to say be prepared to change your diet so getting a smaller waist requires a lot of weight loss for some people it just really can exercise trust me I have tried I did it just didn looking at everything that I was eating even though I thought it was healthy there different things were eating I I took out things that I was having maybe a whole orgies too let maybe different kinds of grains or maybe you have trouble with dairies getting rid of a lot of these your body gonna respond in a way that can actually be pretty surprising so really think about eating those whole grains as we always hearing you know those really healthy Whole Foods a lot of greens and seeds and just water really thinking about just staying to them they call it the outside of the aisles of the grocery store really sticking to those as good staples in your diet number two I huge advocate always eat breakfast so if you day with a healthy breakfast let some oatmeal I try to throw it maybe some hemp seed chia seeds some fruits really just a really good healthy breakfast that body it fasting cycle and if you breakfast I guarantee at lunchtime you the and you and eat whatever you possibly can find and just everything is just going to be out the window so first and foremost take time to eat a really good breakfast third eat smaller more frequent meals so that like a lot of greens and seeds and beans in my diet I mean it seems like I eating a lot but your body all of these good foods a lot quicker than the processed foods so you actually eating more throughout the day so for me it feels more satisfying that I kind of eating this processed food and you feel way down it your body and you just you eating as healthy as you should so think about eating those healthy foods but just eating more throughout the day also keep your blood sugar up kind of makes you just perform better obviously exercise include weights we all know that we put on the more body fat your body gonna burn that weight faster than women because they tend to carry more body more lean muscle than we do that using weights I get your cardio in however you want to do it if you outside running in the gym however plyometrics do something where you doing it consistently at least three or four times a week really getting that heart rate up for maybe 30 35 minutes along with your weight lifting okay let mentioned earlier really avoiding those processed foods if you out and you need to eat something in a restaurant you know couldn at the menu and to find the healthier options there always ways to kind of make things work in restaurants but yeah because they just packed with calories sugars preservatives that not gonna yeah it at full capacity as I said earlier skipping breakfast make sure you eating a good breakfast so make sure you don sugary treats sodas baked goods they packed with animal fats so if that your way of treating yourself I used to be a huge kind of person for doing that oh well I was good for these days so now I so I while for your body to kind of get used to not having that sugary mess in your body and then you really just kind of stop craving it so try to avoid that and of course the worst thing you can do is not being consistent with your workout plan your cardio routine and your diet so if you changes especially around the waistline those are what you to do and like they mentioned earlier it want to think about longevity because a lot of that visceral fat that people carry is extremely dangerous it can lead to high blood pressure heart attacks so it visually looks good it for you all right guys hey I have about four different exercises I quickly these are super great which is kind of helping turn up the waistline there some of my favorites so why don down to exercises the first month twisted scorpion so we do anywhere from 30 seconds of work to about 15 seconds of rest I want you to think about doing 3 2 maybe 5 rounds so the first one you plank position you your shoulders over your wrists feet are going to be about the same position what you reach your knee to the opposite elbow you can kind of drop that shoulder down a little bit and then you to kick it up towards the ceiling and then back to start so you hear oh I elbow ceiling elbow elbow ceiling so when you of drop the hip drop the hip press through the shoulders so we using my obliques for this sitting my shoulders too but really works the waistline just a little bit of a rotation in there it once again we one side rest get the other side ok next we side crunch another one of my favorites you your arms gonna be out we to think about crunching in and then we and be so forward off to the side so we with this move going from the front of the abdominals right into the obliques so crunch and right into the lateral so once we finish obviously we to the other side crunch up to our lateral okay next we a swing touch these are great because they okay so you ground one arm is going to be up overhead you going to touch then you your leg and your arm out you touch again and back down I tend to just stay on one side and then move to the other side so you swing out touch and down via swing out touch down so you little bit of a leg back so you can see you know I engaged that whole time if that just that small lean back makes those get tougher really really fast okay the next one last these are what I call Twizzlers because they twisties and they for the waistline kind of a little bit different you towels or sliders once again your wrists your shoulders are going to be over your wrists you bringing the leg out and twisting then up to the ground then you the office same with the other side so you you leg out rotate the hip down and leg out rotate the hip down so you from the front of your core to those obliques those are going to be a pretty top so make sure you take your 15 seconds of rest make sure you that really good rotation with this one so once again I straight up and trying to keep my body straight as soon as my leg is coming in that then I go straight okay you guys I hope all of this information that helpful for you and a lot of these points are can be for some people because changing your diet I know is gonna be really hard just take baby steps you don cold turkey and just you know clean out the kitchen just kind of maybe start eliminating things gradually and eventually you want to be I hope you workout thanks for joining me again hit the like button subscribe

Chest Workout for Women (DEFINING THE ENTIRE ÂBRA FATÂ AREA)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxYl-napzZ8	ATHLEAN - X	everybody its trader season today we going to be working on defining the chest muscles and losing that dreaded brought that here we go [Music] hey guys so since we know we this a million times you can specifically target an area and lose that body fat there but you can tone the area work the muscle but you really want to think about reducing your overall body fat with cardio conditioning and a total body strength training exercises to will really help with that because that mass you put on the more body fat you going to burn the other critical piece with this is while you of that you always want to really want to make sure that you have a bra that because if you fitting properly that can also cause a lot of bulging in areas that may not be the areas where you want them to fold so really think about that too so today let anatomy lesson here we hitting the pectoralis minor and major so all of the muscles within our kind of our chest area here we hitting the serratus anterior which is really the mo the muscle that be right under that bra line so we gonna be kind of focusing on that area tool okay I have five exercises I have a variety of equipment here a lot of times I tell people if you don equipment at home you can certainly just come up with your own substitutes which is always a good thing alright so the first one we dumbbell rowing press I love this one you can do basically it just doesn require a heavy weight so I would just use a light to moderate weight feet are going to be shoulder-width apart our apps are going to be fully engaged we going to think about just bringing the weights up our elbows are gonna be bent and you back so just bring your elbows back as far as you feel comfortable and then we close together and the weights together so you weight towards you at the top so we here right thinking about dragging the elbows together so I training on my chest muscles here I not just kind of bringing my arms together think about squeezing as I bringing these together so I squeezing that muscle so with this section with these exercises here I could tell people you can do a 30 second work ten second rest or you can do maybe 12 to 15 reps okay so that cuz it kind of gets the muscle to make it kind of waking it up a little bit okay next we abandoned staggered pushup I love these because roids kind of in the same position with our push-ups this is going to add a little bit more resistance to what we the angle of how our body is working so once again it those chest muscles in a different good way so you your fans around your wrists now you going to get into a plank position like you pushup but you off to the side in front of you so you have a good stagger and you go down into your pushup you the other hand out lowering down pressing up back to start so that going to be more of an intermediate to advanced away you can also do these on your knees bringing your hand out lowering down I bringing my shoulder blades together here and I closest to my body I keeping that elbow end the elbow go out too far alright so once again a nice stagger push up back to start straight back tight core step out push up back to start so it because it little bit differently it to kind of change things up a little bit okay elevated hydraulic rows for these I hands I madness this one I like a moderate weight actually I mean you do need something for your elbows because we hydraulic all right so at this one we gonna start in a plank position we want to make sure that our weights are handy and ready kind of next to us because we we our feet are slightly elevated my abs are super tight straight back we going to hydraulic down we back up you can have your feet wider for a little bit better stance we grab our weight but we we to keep them straight and then bring it out hydraulic down back up row row so there grow and grow so when you hydraulic if you right arm first then left and then back up make sure you switch off the dominant arm is the one that want to come back up super tough great for chest and back okay stop push-ups another really good one so now we traditional push-up stance but what I like about this one because it doesn let you cheat because a lot of times it it here you to the side here you little bit of a left they your hands are going to be right next to your chest you your toes you and your glutes and you straight up and we back down we we straight up it by your chest in your back pressing straight up lowering back down so your body should literally be a board if somebody somebody if they were gonna put a glass of water in my back it shouldn fall over your back should be completely straight on the down and on the rise so you and back muscles to lift you up so those are great to use because it teaches you what full range of motion really without pushing with a push-up okay so for our last one as I mentioned before it resistive training but you always want to make sure you car do plyometrics something in there because if you to look for definition you to see it unless you layer of fat okay this is a BOSU pop-up - Frogger so what we we on the BOSU you can bring your feet up and back out so once again I pop with my butt to get me up but it really but it using your upper body - because I doing a lot of balancing here we gonna pop up so you want to get a good rhythm here so 15 seconds of work or 15 reps because what do we want to do we want to get whoo get that metabolic going to the heart rate up start burning those calories that all about that definition though right you guys find really really good exercises to work that area I hope this is really

Get Rid of Back Fat (COMPLETE STEP BY STEP GUIDE!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=050uhXrzmHA	ATHLEAN - X	bra bulge love handles back fat however you look at it excess fat on your back is not a pretty picture we change that here to getting rid of it [Music] you guys so as a woman we all know got dreaded back fat especially in the summer when we have to start putting on tank tops or bread yeah and then we wearing something we kind of start noticing something funny happening here maybe something a little weird is going on around here even down on our lower back so we all know those problem areas so what causes back fat so number one trying to spot reduce we all know this does not work it but if you I burn that it please stop doing that number two lack of use maybe here somebody who working out your legs and you don really work your upper body very much that can be a problem so lack of use number three extra pounds that gonna be the critical one anytime you carrying any extra body fat it show up usually in the areas where our body tends to store the fat so that usually something to really think about as maybe getting rid of the extra extra weight that could be causing it poor posture so a lot of times maybe the way we around that could be causing certain areas to maybe look a little bit more emphasized than they really are because of maybe the way were having our our daily posture okay so these are five proven steps to kind of get rid of the back fat so number one eating cleaner and healthier foods we all have heard it a million times cleaning up our diet but it really does make a difference I cannot tell you how cleaning up your diet is really gonna make a difference because if your everyday rushing around your eating fast food you whatever in the office it and that extra pounds are on and you like how in the world did I get here so by eating cleaner and just really being conscientious of our diet is the first step number two get moving with cardio exercises so it resistive training but adding in a little bit of cardio is great too I recommend at least 3 to 4 days a week at least 30 minutes maximum really getting however you treadmill you love plyometrics however you do it do something to get your heart rate up number 3 strength train your entire body so today I will be showing some some exercises to kind of target that area but as we all know we spot reduce I to maybe use the area if you using it very much but we really want to think about exercising the entire body so it compound movements all of that is really gonna get our metabolism going and that those calories burning the fat ok practice good posture as I was talking about earlier maybe the way we carrying ourselves can emphasize in different areas so just thinking about always trying to keep good posture is good anyway and doing exercises for that specific area we just gonna look at kind of strengthening the area with doing kind of pointed exercises even though the goal is to really work your entire body some of these exercises that I you really do incorporate the entire body that my exercises so hopefully that alright so with these five exercises and what you think about doing 30 seconds of work 15 seconds of rest you can do anywhere from 3 to 5 rounds okay so and then you can use any weight that you would like you can start with something lighter heavier the first one we going to do is a reverse grip double arm row absolutely love these because they really engaged them back better than a lot of things that I was doing so what you to hold your dumbbells you wrists up you bend in your knees and you to bring your arms back so with this one I how I back together weirdly hitting the back with this particular exercise so we and we keeping a neutral head I looking up or down and this one is really great I mean right off the bat this one back area ok renegade row so what I love about this is once again we incorporating the whole body we our abdominals our legs are involved on our entire back area so I prefer using an elevation because I feel like you can get a better range of motion than if you do is I get myself in my plank by making sure my back is straight my head is neutral and I up to the ceiling I hips and keeping my hips closed off I keeping a nice straight line with my back and I to the ceiling but I feeling that to my abdominals my obliques my hamstrings my quads my glutes everywhere whoo so good exercise crunchy and kick out pushup all right you this I little bit all right what I love about this one once again I a little bit but I the back a little bit of core so with this one you knee in your hands you little forward you kicking the leg out you your elbows you out so we lower back a lot of different muscles with this but this is really focusing about everything on the back a lot of my lower back too which can be another problem area kicking lowering down and really pushing through all right so take your break hit the other leg let though you only have one side we gonna do both sides with the light because it does hit the back a little bit differently the lower back okay the next one I love this one this one I would probably start with no way to very light weight with this weighted Superman this does not take a lot of weight so you this is going to work your balance you all in one movement you your arms and your legs and you going to push them straight out so I trying to get a straight line and back to start so I fully engaged I I second isometric hold kicking out really feeling this through everything my shoulders my back and press out yeah very lightweight for that one so once again once you just move to the other leg and to your opposite side okay the last one both see pop up Frogger what I love about this is we get a little bit more metabolic we really using the entire body for this these are the types of exercises I do at the end of my workout because it gets the heart rate up it really strengthening my whole body even though I body I movements okay so we on the BOSU here in a plank if you need to you can go down here and up then pop to your Frogger if you need to or you can go down pop up and explosively jump up kick your feet out pop up kick those feet out and back down so we movement here and that talking about earlier working your entire body burning getting everything moving that I want to sit there and do push-ups for twenty five hours thinking oh well that movements like this I body explosively that give you the changes you along with diet and exercise right okay all right you guys I know it problem hopefully I things to think about some things you could change in your life to hopefully ease all of this into eliminating some of that back fat thanks for joining me today hit the like button subscribe check out a fleet xx for women comm if you haven	Success

5 Proven Exercises for Glute Growth (SECRET TO AN AWESOME BUTT!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL_catxrROA	ATHLEAN - X	hey you guys today let exercises that help promote glute growth and some reasons why your glutes aren growing at all [Music] you guys so the secret to having an awesome butt is number one glute activation number two it the gluteus maximus minimus and your hamstrings they all work in unison we got to get all of those strong if you really want to build really good glutes okay so the first thing we start with is just a quick activation you can do this anywhere you can use bands I example a couple quick ones you can actually spend five or ten minutes with a glute activation which is good to do because we want to get those guys fired up before we start trying to do any kind of work with them okay so these are just going to be placed around the ankle you want to just shift your weight from side to side sometimes out and internally rotate my feet a little bit more to hit the minimus on the side so you gonna step out and just do a pretty good walk out if you have a hallway or something I short little just kind of showing you how to do this so maybe you can do you know three five passes of that you can do a monster walk here and backwards you can do a glute bridge those are really good for activation clamshells are really good for activation so you really just really want to make sure you get those guys firing before doing any kind of heavy load with your glutes okay so the first thing we with is a uni leg squat and what about this is this move is gonna take the best activation of a squat can offer and also the best hip and thigh activation that a lunch can offer all rolled up into the straight exercise so all you bench it exercises because if we have any muscle imbalances we can add in maybe an extra set on the weaker leg that about it so at this one you gonna stand on one side your abs are gonna be tight you posture and you about lowering down and sitting up now the key with this one is kind of hinging the hips back as you making sure that the glue is doing all the work and the hamstrings they gonna be doing a lot of work with this too so you want to hold weight if you finding these super easy you can hold a medicine ball you can hold a dumbbell and up ten to twelve reps three to five rounds really good and make sure you hitting the other side good for Matlin too okay next we old classic that a barbell back squat okay so with this exercise you can use it freestanding you can use a squat rack you can use a smith machine if you just starting out I only recommend that when you to do a back squat because when you on the smith machine doing back squats it takes out the stabilizers which is not good so just kind of do it until you kind of get familiar with how to do that and get out and try to do them so your stabilizers are involved okay so what we to utilize all the posterior chain muscles more than let front squat would so we put the bar back on our shoulders I not rest on my neck it our feet are gonna be about shoulder-width apart if you want to have just a slight toe rotation you can the goal with this is just to get down into a 90 degree angle I my head and chest up my abs are gonna be engaged I hips back and going into a low squat now for me I have ankle mobility issues so what I really should be doing what I normally do is I elevate my ankles and that squat so if I down into 90 degrees that why so if you find you getting all the way down like why do I stop right here for me it injuries from gymnastics so I know that I have to elevate mine to get really into a nice deep squat so for now and I don your back you don out you just want to drop down and press up through the backs of your heels standing straight okay all right thank you guys next we on the bench so step ups so form is really critical with these so let me kind of whip this guy around so you can see what I so I can mention form is really critical with these but they one of the best food the best for blue growth because it completely isolates them that glute so what you do is you bench the key with this one is what your foot is up on the bench it just topping up that anything the key is to push your hips back you can kind of see hime now as I step up I trying to Center the weight on my heel and I that I that knee centric lowering it just not gonna slam myself to the ground so I through my heel pushing up slowly lowering two to three second lower and back down pushing my hips back stepping up and we this is a little cushiony so oh but super good even just those three and I really feeling my glute doing the work so once again of course we switch off to the other leg I pushing my hip back I my heel and then I long time to lower down super good really good just really think about your form with those next we going to go into a hip thrust I gonna push this back because you want to make sure you have a nice stable environment for that get myself a little map here so with this you want to make sure that the bench comes to about your mid scapular area which this one does you want to start I without the weight first you want to you want to have your feet shoulder width apart fairly close to your blues you and lower you lower back down so I dumbbell or barbell and show you this weight that way you can kind of make sure your bench is at the appropriate height for that so I fairly light so a lot of times the weights are a little bit higher so you can just kind of roll this over this is pretty light so I lift it up and over but if you a heavier weight normally that that plates are a lot bigger so I see people just kind of rolling these on okay so once again I in position making sure they back is up nice and straight up in that kind of mid scapular area I actually just let the way it so I gonna grab the weight normally you would have hold it await when you push my hips up and lower down the key with this one is you your head back you want to keep your chin tucked in you forward so I really pushing getting my hips everything almost at a tabletop lowering down its again we want to make sure we looking forward the whole time those are really pushing those glutes up towards the ceiling really trying to get a full range of motion and back down all right even we just light laid I getting a really good okay so next lunch we always have to have an explosive movement so this is a great exercise it signature sprinter move and what about this is it glutes firing it your heart rate up it of something as a finisher to help kind of burn the fat so what you do is you into a 90 degree angle that back knee is gonna get as close to the ground as possible and what we we of our knee so we we to keep everything in a straight line boom down and up so maybe twelve to fifteen reps when you gonna hit the other side so we here and we about that other arm is it you get that met momentum up so here so really use that opposite arm and we really filling our glutes and hamstrings driving up three rounds of maybe 15 to 20 get that heart rate up okay you guys those are five really good exercises remember activation we hamstrings along with trying to get that glute growth so now let really briefly about three of the top glute killers what us with our glute growth the first one is sitting too much so many people live like a sedentary lifestyle they exercises they all day we chronic back pain tight hip flexors tight hamstrings and I understand you guys may huh may have a desk job where you just sitting all day just try to think about getting up from time to time maybe every one to two hours take a five or ten minute walk somewhere let somebody has a question instead of calling them in another building or just get up and walk instead of calling people that get some dynamic stretches and really the key to this is making sure you keeping your glutes firing throughout the day the next we about glute imbalances there causes of that the first one is asymmetrical human nature we of a little off it is in the way that we were warned a lot of us urges already asymmetrical inactivity probably is the biggest reason why our glutes shut down in activity the third would be pain or prior injury and structural issues so research shows that glutes that become inhibited because of maybe something with your lower body you a spinal injury the glutes is that they don turn back on we have to reactivate re-strengthen and record innate just kind of getting that everyday movement and activity back in so that really good to think about the third which I talked about earlier in proper glute activation so for people who are like what the heck is glute activation so basically it saying getting your glutes muscles properly warmed up and firing before your workout so try to think about incorporating maybe three to five exercises maybe five or ten minutes before your glute workout like I clamshells anything bridges are super good just to kind of get those muscles firing anything you can do to kind of get them working before you actually start lifting with heavy loads because they gonna react way more when you heavier once they that hopefully it was helpful even if you had an aha moment here there that we hey thanks for joining me today you guys follow us on our

5 ABS MISTAKES To Avoid (Worst FAILS and How To FIX!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFwRxYUr_uc	ATHLEAN - X	let workout may just not be working in your favor we fixes and many of the exercises you may or may not be doing [Music] Hey ladies okay the good old ab workout and why is it having a major fail or why is it being really successful it hard maybe it we of that it just having a major fail I think we all been there I know how hard it is okay of course the first thing I to bring up for the number one thing is eating habits we all know to lose to lose fat you have to burn more calories than you take in and that really going to reveal those ABS so you want to just make sure you plenty of if you heard a million times clean lean proteins the right kind of carbohydrates good fruits and vegetables just really cleaning up your diet just being thoughtful of when you eating during the week I know we all have our little sugar cravings we all want to kind of have our you know burger night out which is okay but it kind of really being thoughtful of what we thing make sure you sodas and stuff like that because there actually make you look bloated so a lot of processed foods that are loaded with salts and preservatives and stuff you just gonna feel pretty bad after you eat it and you can usually notice like wow I look as bad as I feel right now okay so number two never using resistance I love bodyweight exercises don wrong there but a lot of times I notice a lot of girls really don resistance and when you about abs it your body if I want to see my biceps what am i doing I pretty heavy to try to get a little bit of bulk and something so I can actually see what I on so hard well the absolutely that ABS they pretty much the same way it it want to think about adding some resistance okay let me give you some examples all right so let in the gym and you leg kick up what great great bodyweight exercise so there day but then there wait a day so what am i doing I usually grabbing a plate however heavy you want to go and I weight to that so I more resistance making this a lot harder making my abs tapped out we thinking about doing more building here and what happens when we build more lean muscle we burn more fat so it really goes hand in hand with that okay and another thing chew so let you another super great exercise a lot of times I I pull some days I a 10-pound weight I little bit tougher on myself now this is making my side plank a lot harder my obliques are working harder and it making it a lot tougher to do these moves that were a little bit easier when I was just doing bodyweight so I really turning up the heat on those those muscles and that to do you really just want to make them work a little bit tougher a little bit harder all right number three we always doing the same exercises that is a huge problem I have to say probably 80 to 90% of the people in the gym I really see week after week after week I see them doing the same pattern of the same exercises it it but the whole idea is to kind of change things up a little bit here and there it a couple weeks at a time you want to get adjusted to that get your body used to it but not something you year and year after year that really good okay so variety is key what I do is I have a bodyweight day I have a way today I have an oblique day where I just focus maybe on my obliques I actually have a plank day so that kind of how I think about my my abs I really I try to kind of think about them all of the time and what am i what am i doing you know if you the plank then let add something to it if you easy for you okay so this is a great one you can do so if you and you for like three minutes well you know that little bit let you can do a kick through the top leg is going to be here you the bottom leg through you rotate you we kind of waking it up a little bit more on getting that isometric hold so there little bit of movement a standing oblique crunch this is another great one I it up overhead I getting a little bit of movement here getting up off the floor just kind of working them in a little bit different way all right another good one except cruncher straight-leg these are other ones I really love with these you just gonna create a big X I grabbed the knees so this is really working everything this X on the ground there a lot tougher than it looks if that tends to get a little bit easier you can go X just straight leg just even tougher alright so there there don you trying new things plus it kind of keeps your mind like excited about working out all right and number four you don train them as hard as the rest of your Pioneer so that are working out and then at the end of your workout you throw in okay I gonna do my three sets of twelve crunches and I am done for the day and then you understand why I results in my workout well that probably like okay so the way that I try to think about training my abs and that is training your abs because if you training every other part of your body why are you not spending as much time here as you are with the rest of your body okay so if I say it doing arms I will do my three sets of curls or actually I I done that I set my little bells down and I immediately will go into like a straight bar sit up I straight bar I I situps so I core on the way up and down once I done set that down I

4 Core Exercises for Low Back Pain (FIX IT WITH THIS!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYlAF1IMShk	ATHLEAN - X	hey everybody today we doing the core workout for lower back pain we seconds of work 15 seconds of rest here we go [Music] okay so all we today have a Swiss ball it can be any size I have whatever the larger ones know if you have a small one that reason I I hear of a lot of people who have lower back pain which I am one of them so these are a lot of exercises I doing the last two years since I actually hurt my back and it huge improvement and not only in just my workouts that just in my daily life with taking a lot of the pain away from my lower back so what we we this is probably one exercise I always start my workout with because you really want to make sure that you get those deep core stabilizers your the front of your abs here are really critical in protecting your lower back so if they weak or just not activated when you begin your workout it really leaves your back susceptible to injury so what we gonna do is we you the ball and with this exercise you really want to think about a lot of people think it hamstring exercise it the like they mentioned the deep core stabilizer is just your lower abs you going to think about just kind of digging your heels into the ball as you just do a little bit of a pelvic tilt so I my pelvis towards my face and then I gonna lower it back down so we bring it in and out you can just keep a neutral head sometimes I do kind of look a little bit forward because it helps bring a better range of motion so we just going to crunch in and lower and the goal with this like I mentioned earlier you can do anywhere from twenty to thirty seconds of work and maybe take about 15 it and if you you just want to make sure you know you going within a comfort level you kind of overly doing it okay so that the first exercise so we woken those up a little bit kind of start strengthening those next we going to go into a ball roll out you have the option of doing these on the ground so you just want to have your feet about shoulder width apart you going to put your hands on the ball and you your body out and come back to start so you really want to think about keeping a nice tight stomach not letting your butt drop too much but enough to where you feel like you engaging the lower ab once again the goal of these exercises is to strengthen our lower abs to help take a lot of the work not the the lower back ache so like I really gonna leave you susceptible here because the muscles back here and your lower back is going to be working because this isn we start other people if you having as much chronic pain you can go from a standing position so you do the same thing you out I stomach and I just to let that relax for a minute so now with this exercise we working the entire core not only are we working the front we back here because we do want to keep that toned and strong also kind of keep everything even all right so once we done that for our 20 to 30 seconds of work next we kind of similar to what we did with our first exercise but we ball but once again we focusing on that lower part of our abdominals you completely flat on the ground your hands are going to be critical with this exercise because they into the ground you think about raising your knees up curling your knees to your face and you kind of pressing here pushing with your hands nice and slow now this is a little bit tougher exercise for some people so if you the way up that just still going to baby here that right you abdominals that are critical that we really want to strengthen okay and our last exercise for going to once again we we kind of focus everywhere here what I gonna have you do is just get into a regular plank here our feet are about shoulder width apart nice flat back we we down and you slight hand raise so what we now is we strengthening here as we strengthen down here two critical areas for a nice healthy lower back you can just kind of periodically raise but whatever speed and level and once you seconds you can kind of sit back stretch that out a little bit and then go into your next round okay you guys I would suggest maybe two to three rounds this is a slow progressive exercise for somebody who more pain for me I tough to manage my back pain so I usually will do about three rounds of thirty Seconds I really hope these work as well for you as they did for me I love them I said for the last few years and I great results hey guys check out athlean-x X for women comp if you haven you haven the day they come out leave us a comment let me know what are you doing and I work out with you guys soon you	Success

Should I Workout When IÂm Sore? (5 WAYS TO FIX MUSCLE SORENESS)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUVcTDy-Oyw	ATHLEAN - X	hey you guys today we the question should I work out when I sore [Music] all right so we asked of us many many times so I try to answer it for you guys today so should I work out when I always a tough question because it like do I go to the gym do I just stay at home what should I do so when you delayed onset muscle soreness and it really common and the pain can be anywhere from range from anywhere from being mild to pretty severe so and it usually happens anywhere from one to two days out of your workout so it common thing and maybe if you the gym or you while and you just decide to take your workout to a new level and you feeling that muscle soreness I know it can be a hard decision to make I there many times but I the answer is yes you do want to work out and you want to think about they work out as a recovery workout so actually sitting around is probably worse because everything is just kind of sitting there and the main thing you want to do is really start thinking about getting the lactic acid out of your muscles because that is causing the soreness is lactic acid and tiny micro tears in the muscles because the body is trying to build bigger stronger muscles so I want you to just think about doing a light workout because if I workout what that gonna get your circulation going and that that soreness that you also if you let leg workout and that really feeling a lot of the pain maybe get in the gym and just think about doing something with your upper bodies because even just doing something with your upper body once again we circulation going we lactic acid moving and that the critical part right there so let me give you a couple of little tips to help you leave that soreness before going into the gym so I want you to think about doing stretching dynamic stretching any kind of mobility exercises because when you you great you really don in and lift cold so think about doing your dynamic warm-ups that in turn is going to warm you up think about staying hydrated drinking fluids before your workout during your workout after your workout critical because once again it that lactic acid kind of flushed out of your system also if you want you can do just a light massage let certain areas that are feeling kind of tender just give yourself just a little massage kind of get the muscles moving around a little bit that thing and also if you specific areas you can also ice because you really want to think about controlling any kind of inflammation so that working out if you are having a lot of pain in one particular area and you having to ice a lot that might want to consider maybe I do need to take some time and maybe not worth that bad area for a while and that where you could maybe just go in and let of a core exercise just kind of let that recover a little bit more because that really the key with your workouts is recovery all right you guys I hope that was helpful Hey follow us on Abney xx For Women calm we button subscribe and I look forward to seeing you guys soon	Success

#1 SECRET to Burning LOWER BELLY FAT (Nutrition + Workout)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRMW4Ikx2FI	ATHLEAN - X	hey guys trainer Susan with athlean-x axe hated a we about the secrets of burning lower belly fat a lot of the lower belly fat can be attributed to bad diet hormonal issues let some exercises [Music] hey guys so when it comes to lower belly fat I know it to lose body fat so I recently learned which I had no idea that actually eating foods high in sugar is the number one contributor to belly fat I mean I knew eating bad food and all that stuff but it kind of thought hmm maybe think wow gosh there where we really need to kind of look at what we how many treats are we kind of giving ourselves every week because that is all gonna add up and it that visceral fat around the lower belly which is really an unhealthy fat to have so we want to make sure we some good sleep we want to avoid stress because if you don body sugary food your cortisol is going to increase and that fat so think about eating good healthy Whole Foods eliminating sugar or at least trying to cut down on a lot of it and that I think is gonna make a big difference and also getting in some good consistent workouts with some good cardio okay you guys I have looks like four different exercises today one of them I call it trifecta that do each exercise without any stopping just to make it more fun and burned the first one I is a Swiss ball roll out I usually do this one before I really do any kind of core at the gym or any kind of ab workout because it helps activate the core especially the deep core stabilizer is so this is a really good one so what you do is you front of your Swiss ball you put your hands here and you gonna roll out to a straight back you gonna hold for maybe anywhere from five to ten seconds I back my abs are fully engaged and I gonna roll straight back up I that sometimes I around a little bit to kind of make my ABS stabilize and then I back to start roll back out another good thing too is you can lift one leg this is another great way to kind of make those outs it kind of helps activate the glutes - and we cup so with these you could do maybe anywhere from eight to ten you can really feel like you everything fired up and ready to go okay next we next we so no equipment for this you gonna get on your mat okay the goal with this is to do ten of each on each leg I these alternating okay so we lay back we tricycles so we body up three four five six seven eight nine ten and this motion is really focusing specifically here you feel that it the lower abs with this one next we just need to go into a straight leg kick the same thing but now I straight leg or five six seven eight nine ten last thing we just see the kick out you to be here and you slightly lean back one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and you can increase those numbers depending on your fitness level you can rest for a few seconds I usually try to do all of my circuits back to that because I feel like it burns the muscle out it makes it more so I would probably take maybe 10 seconds and then you go back into my second set okay we bit more metabolic here we into a med ball you have to crunch with this one I usually just take like a heavy medicine ball you can really have anything to just put your hands on this makes it a little bit harder to balance so what I gonna make sure my shoulders are over my wrists my abs are completely engaged my back is straight so all I I gonna tuck in so we little quick movement here and the goal for this would be 15 okay last but not least we these are very lower core intensive but they okay we so meaning you roll back you the ceiling because that my lower abs I hands I start roll kick up to the ceiling pop up out out back to start just that little kick out there this primarily all lower abs you gonna feel that one I know that world that can be kind of tough because it is a it that momentum when you to help get your feet up and out okay guys three rounds of that boom so these are all really good lower ab intensive exercises along with watching our diets eliminating or cutting out sugars getting good sleep getting some good cardiovascular exercise in that going to be a great combination to help combat that lower belly fat thanks for joining me today you guys hey check out a fleet X X for women com Hey they have a great new program called map shred the max roid meal plan actually lets you customize your meal plan based on maybe how much fat you want to lose and it allows you to choose as many shred swaps you want to per day so doing the shred swaps actually teaches you how to eat for less for actually for more fat loss so it helps you kind of learn how to eat to swap different foods out it program check it out that hit the like button subscribe and I see you guys soon	Success
7 Back of the Arm Isolation Exercises | TRICEPS | Blast Arm Fat	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqR-e8Z3jO4	ATHLEAN - X	hey you guys today we talking about backs of the arms so I going to show you seven tricep isolation exercises to help combat that back arm fit and strengthen those triceps [Music] hey guys so you might be surprised to hear that your workout routine possibly isn area of your body that back arm because the back arm is a particularly stubborn area to lose fat and the reason can be is because a lot of that arm fat can be indicative of maybe something like low testosterone levels men and women both have it it but a lot of women can actually have lower levels due to things like stress other common pitfalls can be an adequate protein intake not lifting heavy enough weights not training intensely enough or lack of quality of sleep so there really a lot of stuff that can go on so the that about making sure we balanced diet we good exercise in we of lifting a little bit heavier weights because it is good for bone density for women but it also kind of helps to regulate a lot of our hormones so that something really good to think about ok so what I to go through seven different exercises they back area of the arm is particularly the tricep area some of these are gonna get a little bit more metabolic at the end because we do want to think about losing overall body fat so we tone pretty much our entire body and that us lose more body fat okay so the first exercise we dog tricep extension what I love about these is not only are you working your back of your arm you your whole body and especially a lot with core you dumbbell for this one with all of these don to 15 reps per side I want you to do 3 rounds before you move on so three rounds of each exercise before you move to the next one ok so what you do is you fours I what I here I side as possible I arm and my opposite at the same time so this is really going to make my core do a lot of work so if we kick back three four five six seven eight nine ten so you can see I kicking that dumbbell up towards the ceiling I is doing some really good work so where the whole body is really kind of working along with hitting that particular area next we favorites we pushup so if this one for my beginners what you start on all fours we get our shoulders over our wrists we gonna rotate our elbows here see how they want you to think about rotating them tour the inside is facing out what that keep the tricep our arms as close to our body as possible and it isolate that tricep area so you going to lower down try to touch your chin to the ground and press up not through your back through that tricep back arm area and press if you can 12 to 15 that tough do as many as you can to you just feel like you group you regular push-up you your arms in you press up lower down and press up so the key with that is really keeping those elbows close to the body okay next I kind of working your core a lot here but that next we alternating rotating kickback so our prior kickback we were here we going to rotate it a little bit and you dumbbell you here but then you for the back so it just a little bit the dumbbells gonna be here so my beginners what you do is I but I don I want you leaning forward Troy your abs are having to hold you up that whole point is making those work too so you and you down here rotate kick up and back down just think about rotating it back down so 15 on each side really makes your core work a lot harder for my in bounce group we position flat back we here rotate and back down here and we just going to give it a nice little rotate at the end so we really pushing up it different than what we really hits that muscle a little bit different way okay next we go into bat wings so with these I really want to make sure that your palms are facing you so you nice bend in your knee nice kind of hinge do the hips sitting back the arms are going to start all the way down you just going to think of like a bat and you and all the way down if you doing these that backs of your shoulders so that our palms are facing us so here kick out and down up kick out and down another really good run okay exercise number five banded push-ups we around our around our wrists we to be on the mat for beginners you here and what you you your arms out you your push-up and you can walk your hands back in here push-up and walk your hands in what this band is doing is putting a lot more tension on the backs of my arms as I group we gonna pop our hands out hopefully the back is not going to move you to go down and back to start pop our hands out push up and back to start so it the sides of our arms okay resistance band kickbacks so if you have bands at home with the handle or even just resistance the longer rece more resistance bands are good cables at the gym obviously so if these we want to get another good bend at the waist knees are bent arm is bent that right next to the side and we going to kick that up towards the ceiling so we that tricep kicking it up and back so there sometimes I change my grip to a forward grip where I that okay I palms up and then there do palms down so it just bury your grip because sometimes it can just actually tweak and hit the muscle a little bit differently all right so those are really good last one we this is where we try to get a little bit more metabolic we whenever you things like plyometrics a lot of times they see people doing a ton of leg stuff but I was thinking you need to get your upper body involved too okay so what we gonna go down into basically like a one-arm plank so we here you you back out to a straight back so I really feeling that in my backs of my arms to help hold that body weight I trying to think about getting your shoulders over your wrists and pop up whoo so I workout on my arms but I whole body going burn burn burn burn those calories okay you guys seven great exercises isolating that

7 Upper Chest Isolation Exercises | BLAST BRA FAT | Breast Lift	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH3xLHjX5iE	ATHLEAN - X	everybody try nurse ism with athlean-x X today we seven upper chest isolation exercises we naturally lift our breasts and beat that battle bra line fat here we go [Music] okay guys so today our focus is going to be the pectoralis major muscles the and actually more of the upper muscle of that so what we focusing on this muscle here so you got to swing your arm up you muscle tighten right here so just right here and we the front delt because these two like to work together so we that area today what those muscles is what if we help kind of strengthen these it going to naturally lift the breast because that a lot of that tissue up and working here along with that front delt that all that bra fat can kind of settle in right here kind of a neglected area so it actually do work together so we really focus on that kind of area all right you can see I things happening here I this as easy as possible not the exercises but just following along with me think about doing anywhere from 12 to 15 reps with this exercise three rounds I always tell people try to do all the bigger rounds together so once you completed one take maybe 20 30 second rest start with your second one first what we so what I love about these is this is just kind of gonna give you that mind-body connection of where that muscle is it a little bit so it what we sweep our arm up and if you can take your hand you can actually feel with that sweeping motion the muscle we really gonna isolate today so right here obviously you delt working really well but the main thing is really getting a good sweep to hit that front muscle right here that very top muscle so you just maybe you want to do 12 to 15 really taking the time to concentrate on that particular set of muscles of what kind of evading those muscles waking him up for everything else we okay so once you finish those next we gonna go into a lo box decline pushup so super low box here if you like you can absolutely probably do these on the ground if you we us we hands are gonna be out in front of us so what we is not going straight down we going to go out a little bit so we going to go out and then we press back so I forward a little bit and pressing back so once again that really focusing on I can that that top PEC muscle is doing a lot of the work here kind of leaning forward pressing back leaning forward pressing back so do this 12 to 15 reps take your rest I really love those because I really can tell that that we we so with these if you have fans at home or at the gym these are great for cables at the gym you can either do a low setting or you could do a little bit higher setting with these at the gym you could go here or like a mid level or maybe like these normally you would connect with in the door like at the doorknob level unfortunately I can only connect these at a lower level but they still work this way I back to you because that I can anchor these but you can still see what I with your palms facing out and what you kind of do like believe what we did earlier we lower back so I chest muscles together I and controlling the up and I controlling the back so I focusing on that upper chest area a little bit of that shoulder is doing a lot of the work too but once again I really feeling that to the top of my chest I show you once again my arms were here and I was doing that sweeping motion once again it to think about sweeping up and back sweeping up getting the arms crossing a little bit in front and back that going to give kind of more of a full rep or range of motion without you know the muscle oh a righty number four dumbbell squeeze press so what we with these you dumbbells however heavy you want to go you gonna have enough room here you guys gonna be able to see my doing okay so I up here my dumbbells are gonna be together I I going to have these resting I to start by pressing them together super hard I at lower so the whole time it just about pressing these together and trying to keep it at chest level a little bit higher because we on that upper PEC muscle I squeezing these two dumbbells together the best that I can all right so that exercise you guys just really pressing those together because once again it really gonna focus on that particular area okay next we side push-ups alright so with these you lower arm is going to wrap your body the upper arm is going to be here these are going to hit triceps for their hit that muscle because it takes a lot of that chest muscle there to push your body up to make these easier your leg can be straight you up and lower up and lower so I completely engaged right now so I pressing up and down to make it a little bit tougher I can bend my knees you just want to tap the shoulder and press all the way through this is probably one of the best isolation exercises for that particular area it really really works good flip over make sure you do your 12 to 15 on the opposite side okay next we grip barbell chest press you can do these on the bench I show them on the ground so I a reverse grip here just because that grip once again changing that grip around and set up here where it to take away from that particular muscle rotating around here you can even feel the muscle engage so that doing reverse grip so I more of a narrow grip too so you gonna lay out your bench run round so we more narrow we relaxed position our back flat on the bench and then we to the ceiling and back down press up and back down really think about keeping the arms close to your body and just pressing all the way up and bringing it all the way back down really gonna start feeling that when you get about seven to eight reps in depending on heavier weight is all right okay now and gently okay and the last we a little bit of a plyo push up what I love about these we about these is they little bit more metabolic so with these you can just use a bench or maybe a chair at home just make sure it so you and you the straight back but with your push up all that pressure and resistance is going right here in your chest so that where you you rounds 5 12 to 15 reps rounds if you want and that great finisher for all of this so we have seven great exercises that gonna isolate that particular muscle it that just kind of sits right here once again to make sure you good eating plan being consistent with your workouts make sure you some good sleep okay guys I hope this is helpful thanks for joining me today hit the like

7 UNDERBUTT ISOLATION Exercises | Lower Glutes | Butt-Thigh	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43NGhLZ_E	ATHLEAN - X	everybody chatter susan exercises that were going to work on today are specifically going to target the glutes and hamstrings many of these exercises are weighted to help build the muscles and create a nice rounded butt and strong hamstrings [Music] hey guys so everyone about this whole underbite thing that that kind of glute-ham tie in which we all know you have to have a super clean diet because that area on most women to actually be able to see that unless you to do a show a lot of the times all we can do is really just strengthen and try to build that area up but the key with that is just a super super clean diet good cardio really just making sure that you know we and really watching our diet so let through these seven exercises today that are really going to kind of isolate and focus on that kind of hamstring glute area okay our first exercise we to do the barbell glute bridge I to show you this without any weight just because beginners you probably don need to be using a barbell quite yet you might want to wait until you kind of get used to doing this it takes a lot of hip extension but this is one of the highest glute activation exercises there is so we cannot include this one all right so what we to lay on the ground sometimes people will do this on the box I prefer it doing it on the ground we to have our feet flat on the ground our hands are going to be out you to think about keeping your heels as close to your butt as possible you want to think about pushing through your heels and squeeze your glutes into a full extension so hopefully you can see good from here you get my hair tucked under okay so we and really think about just trying to get a straight line from here to there so really just pushing those glutes and relaxing so my beginners this is what I want you to do just focusing on squeezing the glutes getting a straight line here really opening the hips so maybe 12 to 15 reps you can rest once you a second and third round of that so for the more advanced you can grab a barbell and how much weight you want to use I not going super heavy just for demonstration purposes I just got a light towel here all right a towel here just to kind of help with so it doesn get into my hips okay so once again our feet are just about shoulder width apart super close to the backs of my butt and I just know I lower down pressing and squeezing my glute and lowering back down and I just give a little tap on the ground lower back down pressing those glutes you could do maybe a five-second hold at the top and press down alright great little exercise to kind of get everything fired and going okay so let out of the way all right so number two shrimp squat a lot of people probably are not even sure what that is but these are really good I would say probably the best way to do this is with a weight because it helps at the counter balance I going to keep imagine you may tap your knee on the ground with these so I would just take maybe an eight pound weight you gonna bring your arm out straight and you knee to the ground it that glute to bring you back up to a standing position let so maybe twelve twelve to fifteen on each side besides a little bit tougher from you sometimes we have a site that a little weaker but still push through and make that other site work and press out whoo that though really good absolutely are going to isolate that area next we go into a reverse lunge with a kick so I have however much way you want to use we shoulder-width apart you step back into your reverse lunge and then you into a kick right into that reverse lunge kick up and with these I really think about sitting back through my glute really sitting back and kicking up to hit the other glute so kick sitting back through my heel and then kicking up [Music] because that one from that other side so if I back here this is where I sit back through that glute and then I going to kick and isolate the other glute so here and here alright next we squat some of my favorites the key with this is making sure your foot is not out too far otherwise you more hitting more of the quad so foot on the bench front foot is in fairly close I like to bring my plate up to keep my head straight because that keeps me going straight down and then pressing up so I ground they do a little touch and then I press through my heels this ain alright 12 to 15 on each side alright step up alright so this is a little bit of a two-parter here so with these what I like to do we the first one I usually go a little bit heavier so for the step up I usually go a little heavier and with these I always think about leaning forward slightly before I step up because I feel like that engages my glute a little bit more I just slightly lean before I step up so once I finish my 15 on each on one particular leg I will just set my weights down and then I immediately go into a toe tap so from here I just think there stay on that same leg and I just burn it out with fifteen of these so it already on fire from using all the weight now you just go right into a body weight whoo so what that looks like from here is I not stopping and doing this I my toe I up fully extending through my hips and whoo alright that was exercise five kind of a two parter single leg squat another one of my favorites I of unilateral or one leg training especially for legs alright so with these you straight down sitting back and pressing up sit back and press up so from the side you that I am sitting back and pressing up I all about sitting back and making that glute and hamstring literally do all of the work and press who drop the 15 each leg rest and do your other reps I love those since our pretty one of the best exercises okay number seven low weighted prisoner get up jumps okay so this is kind of the final little burnout you can grab some dumbbells so we to go into a low prisoner getup which would be here and then you jump and we to alternate your legs each time staying little explosively popping up so the key with that one is always trying to stay low and explosively jumping up fifteen rounds fifteen reps three rounds all right you guys seven great exercises that are really going to focus on that under butt area once again remember a clean diet consistent workout program lots of good sleep lots of water all that stuff you time thanks for joining me today hit the like button subscribe leave a comment below there seen yet you thanks for

5 MUST DO Exercises to Slim Your Legs (LEANER STRONGER THIGHS!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNGVJOxUyr8	ATHLEAN - X	Hey ladies trainer Susan here today I going to show you five must do exercises to slim your legs these are all bodyweight exercises [Music] okay so to really make changes in your muscles you sometimes just stepping away from the weight rack is a really good thing especially if you slim your legs out there explosive plyometric type exercises some isometric exercises that are really really good for getting in there and Tonie not muscle tightening it up but not necessarily growing it if you looking to have kind of grow the muscle okay so we exercises the first thing we start with is we a side lunge to cross over tap so with this one you your hands up high you about just reaching over what I love about this one is it actually helps engage the abductors the inner thigh before we hit the outer so we gonna do kind of a tap here with a little bit of a raise and they to go right into a lateral lunge right into the lateral lunge so with this with this workout video you can do anywhere from 15 to 20 reps and I want you to think about doing three to five rounds because once again we the legs out to do that we need to kind of work on those muscles but yet we want to kind of burn that body fat off because that down okay so hands are up overhead we tapping and then we really think about engaging with that little sweep that inner thigh muscle they tap and down so once we finish one side we opposite side so we reach and reach and reach down alright I prefer to do each exercise I do my fifteen on one side I break I and then I next rounds I mean you can do it circuit style but I feel like if you just stick with the same exercise it really really keeps that muscle under tension taxes it out really works it so that suggestion next we runners lunge to balance I love this this is one of my new favorite exercises so you you going to get like your break it up right out of the blocks and what you to do is you and kick that leg in the air so when I going down I keeping that back of glute engaged here you up these may not look like they much but I guarantee after you finish one set of 15 your hamstrings and glutes are going to be screaming out yo and these are actually better without weights I tried using weights and and the body weight one was way better so you you up think about a flat back you don have to hyperextend your back getting that me as close to the ground as you can who really concentrates on the back of your legs really really good okay third I still hold lunch kickbacks so at this one you can use a slider paper plants whatever you may have we going to put that on one side these are great because this is going to be a complete isometric hold this is what legs and strong so with these I want you to think about lowering down as far as you can go you keeping your head and chest up I to try to keep that leg at almost a 90 degree angle and I kicking that back leg out this is where 15 to 20 reps so we down here we you really have some kind of hip flexor issue or just mobility issues that okay but I would really like to see you down as low as possible once again keeping that head and chest up that going to put more force on your glutes hamstrings and quads doing all of the work here whoo so once that burning you sides and we the opposite side staying down as low as we can it movement and not front leg I bring that knee almost back up to where it meets the other knee should really get that full range oh those are good those are top those are really gonna hit those quads hamstrings and glutes okay now that your legs are completely dead I with this if you have a medicine ball maybe a chair or anything you may have what we marker I want your butt to touch it feet are going to be pretty wide apart this is an explosive exercise you gonna tap it and pop up tap pop so it all just about tapping that bubble and explosively jumping up use your arms that in the air 1520 graps rest go into your next few rounds of that laughs we scissor power switch to my breath here for a second this is gonna be the hand to the opposite foot and you in the air so you pop up and change your feet in the air try to think about getting a straight leg in the air nice little switch 15 20 reps take about a 10 to 15 second break let your heart rate get down finish your third fourth fifth round okay you guys these are some great exercises getting in your workouts especially if you legs I just want to slim them down I kind of tired of being on the treadmill or just running these are some great pine metrics to incorporate because they muscles working in a different way there your body is going to react in a different way

Resistance Band Workout (TOTAL BODY EXERCISE BAND ROUTINE!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR-ezwOCUmI	ATHLEAN - X	hey you guys it athlean-x X for women hate minivans are a great go-to quick way to add some resistance into your workouts so let get to it [Music] are you guys so I really love adding mini bouncing it I pretty consistently for the last probably four to five months and I really do feel a difference and it kind of makes your workout feel it a little bit different if you weights and different things like that many pounds are great so what I love about him is you can buy these they super inexpensive you can find them anywhere they usually come in packs of four to five they come in different resistance levels like they come from like a light to medium heavy extra heavy so they that because different exercises that are going to require maybe heavier amounts and other exercises so now that we kind of have that figured out we are going to go through about five different exercises today I just want to show you how you can use these in different ways they you want to activate something especially like glutes and stuff you can do bound walk so I think a lot of people know kind of the basics you can do with them but I want to show you to show you you can use them for more than just that okay our first exercise we start with push-up jacks so what you going to do is you with the bands around your wrists and around your ankles so hopefully once around my wrists I little bit lighter band so I can get into a wider push-up at enough to where I throughout my shoulder complex the bands around your ankle can be a little bit tighter but not too tight because you want to be able to kind of get your legs apart you work through the abductor and and your glutes alrighty so once we have our bounds in place you start in a plank position and what you to jump your feet out jump them in and then I want you to think about your jumping your hands out you go into a push-up jump your hands back in so you of a rhythm and you can do this obviously you can have some kind of padding I have a mat I probably should have put down so you a slight jump with your hands it doesn have to be a large one even if you if you don can walk them out and walk them in if need be so there are ways to modify that so it chest my shoulder is my back all of those good things and we hitting that the leg area which is always good shape okay another one of my favorites we BOSU out for this one I probably get something that resistance because we going a pretty wide range of motion so we the BOSU our feet are going to be out we motion throughout our feet we to kick out we we out you can keep your hands on the ball if you like so let me get this around my ankle again if you want to make sure they all right hang out pop them in and I want you to think about sitting to a low squat so you can either raise your hands or keep them on the ball so core work a lot of leg work here and you your heart rate up oh so I can really feel that here if I didn wouldn sides of my place okay next we we backs so you towels or sliders really good for this for this one once again I would use maybe a light to medium because we gonna have a wide range of motion here so I we our bands are going to be around our wrists our hands are gonna be on the towel and you keeping your head down a neutral head and all I to think about bringing my shoulders back dropping my elbows down and coming all the way up so at the top of the movement my head it I kind of and bring my shoulder blades together and back here so I this through my triceps my delts my rear delts my little built and my back all those really good areas so with all these exercises you can do a time to work out of 30 seconds with maybe 10 seconds rest 3 rounds or you can do maybe 12 to 15 reps so that exercise it everything on your arms under your upper back it kind of injuries and you don lift weights you really good range of motion with that one okay C sub on your ankles so for this you elbows we again we are going to go with a once again a not a medium band around your ankles this is going to target your entire core area so we on our elbows we having a flat back a neutral head our glutes are tight but you think about is bringing your legs apart to where you really feel that resistance and now you seesaw you forward pushing back as far as you feel comfortable so are you also getting some obliques in here kind of getting the whole gamut of that core firing so once again you can do 30 seconds of work or you can do maybe 12 to 15 reps who so the tighter the band the top so Kathy alright ok lastly we hit legs so if you don you can certainly use dumbbells barbells here ok so what we gonna put the band around up around your knees this time so once again with these we abductor but when we go into our squat that hamstrings glutes so it great full move here so you just put the barbell back behind your head let it rest on your shoulders not on your neck feet are gonna be about pillar wider than shoulder width apart we once we come up we nice swing off to the side back to our starting position down kick it out so at this one once again the higher level band or thicker band you use you gonna have a lot more resistance for those kick outs it those muscles burn all right 30 seconds of work or 12 to 15 reps quick little 10 to 15 second break three rounds all right you guys so just a really great way to kind of turn to turn up the heat in your workouts make things a little bit tougher challenge the muscles that always what we things a little bit are challenging change it up maybe you have never use bands before you really gonna feel it these these little things can get you pretty sore pretty fast hey you

5 NEW Glute Exercises You SHOULD BE DOING!!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMqegADyKxU	ATHLEAN - X	Hey ladies trainer Susan with athlean-x axe today i glute exercises you definitely need to be doing [Music] hey you guys so here exercises maybe even kind of trying to do the same stuff for a while that experimenting kind of looking around at what other people are doing I kind of catch glimpses of like that so I five different exercises you will need some cables for this and a bench and maybe a mat okay the first we lunge so at this one I usually put a plate out in front just kind of a handle we have it on the lowest setting and just figure out what weight works for you like a moderate to heavy weight what you the ball of your foot on that plate it just helps actually activate the glue a little bit more you big step back keeping your arms straight so you little bit farther so you take the big step back and head straight up back and back and up so I want to let the weight go down and then you you really think about getting that knee to the ground keeping the ball of the foot on the plate because I just helps get a little bit better range of motion so down and pull and pull so I thinking about driving up through the front of my leg and that glute I really feeling a good burn on the back side there so taught the fifteen obviously when you switch legs we the opposite side something a little bit different that really isolates the glutes okay next we crossover kick so we that off you need to find a cuff or some kind of attachment where you can get that hooked up to the cable machine sometimes they they I gotta get there we go okay so once you get your cuff on ten minutes later with mine make sure it all nice and snug so what I is I a fairly lightweight just to give it a go of how this is gonna feel I put this on my outer leg what I do is I actually we just gonna be down here this is a little tricky at first as you can tell okay so what you gonna straighten that leg out behind you and then you to the side it sweeps back behind you so what I love about this one is this really gonna focus on that medius gling on the side kind of that side but so just think about keeping a nice straight spine kicking off to the side because said it kind of trail back behind you a little bit farther and kick out whoo so maybe 12 to 15 reps on that one - we next we cabled fire hydrant a lot of times you ground but to really turn up the heat you can do these on a cable so you want a slight bend in your waist and you just going to think about the traditional fire hydrant really really really really targeting that gluteus medius on the side keeping it nice bend in the leg kicking out so not only am i filling this on the top on my leg that doing the work this glute on this side is just absolutely on fire right now so that so 12 to 15 reps three rounds whoo fire fire okay so hopefully it takes less than 10 minutes to get off all right next we ready to go into a kneeling cable pull through so I see a lot of people doing these standing but what I like about the kneeling version is is you can actually go heavier and if you have any lower back issues like I do it doesn good standing so you the same position as most of the time you see people here and they be down on our knees so like I said you with this so you back and pull through so really think about keeping that full extension pushing those hips out really getting that nice knees on the top I use a lot more weight doing it that way okay last thing we straight leg elevated glute bridge what makes this different is we viewing it with a straight leg now we elevating our legs which is nice so what you your back flat on the ground feet on a bench I like to actually rotate my feet out a little bit more because I feel like it activates the glutes a bit better and you squeeze at the top keeping those toes pointed outward really it difference from here I can kind of lift up as soon as I rotate my feet out it frees my hips much more glute activation you can actually hold a dumbbell here if you want to add some weight but for me with my lower back issues I just feel like I get a lot more extension here and I feel like I activation and I could I just really feel this a lot more like I said you can hold that heavier dumbbell if you if you it you don the traditional way that you see people doing them on advantage to me I they just not very comfortable to me okay you guys five new different exercises to hit the glutes it stuff a little bit differently especially trying to focus a little bit more on that Mediaset side glute maybe you direction it things up thanks for joining me today hey click the like button subscribe leave a comment below hey check out our athlean Max shred program it new program or you just released to help you burn body fat and maintain the muscle you program that no matter how much body fat you looking to lose thanks for joining me	Success

also works with a band if you can loop a band on a door or something that will also work so we going to start with a straight arm just have a handle we nice tight stomach with this one you want to concentrate having just really good posture with this one so what we gonna do is we that arm straight down you can go a little past your body here and at the top you want to make sure you far enough to where you good stretch on that lat that step back to me you feel like you getting a nice stretch but not overly and you straight back up just really focus on lap muscle here and this you pull straight down all the way up get a good stretch all the way back down a little past my body all the way up so if those you can do 12 to 15 reps on each side it that muscle activated and you can go as heavy as you want but I just doing that a little bit I number two we rocket-launcher rows so with this one we a little bit heavier weight the key with this exercise is we slow cadence so when your after you wrote up you using about a three second lowering on these I want you to think about going into a nice deep lunge nice straight back neutral head we row up and one two three row up 1 2 3 up 1 2 3 up 1 2 3 and with those you want to make sure your palms are facing you who just slowing that cadence down that difference on those really good for kind of hitting right under where that bra area is here okay and next we go into assisted chin-ups so it knees I usually just use a resistance band this is going to give me about 25 pounds of extra help I here so you foot in the band however you want to do a grip gyms have different this one of a wide grip here there on the backside of this so whatever kind of grip you want to work and you gonna try to pull all the way up lower down get that full extension all the way up and lower down you can see I of relaxing my shoulders at the end so I of motion with them so you can use bands that have way more resistance that are going to help you even give you more help a lot of gyms will have those and like I said work different grips work out great you know a reverse grip wide it grip all different grips all of them are going to be great for your back I know those could be tough but they very good okay next we high poles so in this one just grab a Swiss ball I just have a resistance tube then I anything you have own or at the gym and you want to keep this at about chest level just kind of get yourself to where you feel like you resistance this one down I be nice and straight and I bring this back bring you my shoulders my scapular area back really pulling it concentrating on those coming all the way back really opening that chest area and these bands come in all different resistance levels you can go light or heavier just to make sure you rep out of that we that scapular area in the back together that 15 to 20 reps on that okay last thing we push up jump just kind of get the metabolism going hit those bra line areas with the flies here a little bit of shoulders kind of all through back here when we go into our push-up of course that back area the jump just getting out metabolism fire it up that body fat so what you you the waist you the nice eyes tell people bird just that nice little arc here alright so we gonna pop down on the ground into a push-up really hitting that back our feet are gonna be here pop up go

of exercise cardio and healthy eating habits here are seven waist chiselling exercises to create a smaller waist [Music] hey guys so here are seven exercises we let muscles we focus on the transverse abdominis this muscle actually wraps around the spine and that stability it muscle so that help bring the waist in we focusing on the internal and external obliques these are located on the sides in the front of the abdomen so kind of here right on the sides and last the rectus abdominis and that that basically runs all the way down the front here so we hitting everything with these seven different exercises oh right team as you can see what equipment I have not a lot of equipment is needed the first thing we start with is a standing bound rotation so I band with about hmm rights it moderate resistance not too heavy kind of hooked it under here so so it to get some rotational exercises in or transverse exercises I the handle with two hands get a good grip on it I shoulder-width apart or actually a little wider than that my abs are gonna be engaged my head and chest are gonna be up so what you gonna think about finding a marker and I Jen usually tell people at your bellybutton so you the band to go past your bellybutton once you reach this point and it about rotating back to start rotating back to start so you can see we getting a rotation but I that pull so we but we too so with this workout you can do anywhere from 15 reps or you can do 30 seconds of work 10 seconds of rest three rounds some people like to do times other people are reps of a rep even and then of course the other side Raven find your belly button is your marker rotate sound stop so stabilization here rotation here so really really good especially if you doing any kind of sports like golf or baseball anything with rotation is good alright next we ground we crunch alrighty so we our elbows and what you is you one side drop it to the other side and then you knees to your elbows so drop drop tell those knees to elbow so you could orally fill those in your obliques pretty much everything with this one so remember keep a nice tight core in between those two so your backs not kind of slumping them in between okay next we cross punch so I eight pounds here rotate my mouth slightly alright so what you with this one is you your weights you knee you here you you across your body you down up crossing the body and lowering back down think about rolling the ABS up and then you down so we whole front app abdominal area right into the oblique area and down so let this alright bed ball rotations okay here some rotational a little bit of rotational earth you just need a larger Swiss ball a lighter you don super-heavy medicine ball you walk out to where your shoulders are on the Swiss ball your arms are going to be straight your feet are going to be wider than shoulder-width apart my hips are going to be up nice flat tabletop and what you to think about rotating your shoulders I just rotation in my upper body through the top of my trunk so I ball move underneath me but I to keep my legs kind of in that same position without letting them rotate out too much it twist in that core area and all right another good one okay standing cross crunches I don enough people doing standing exercises at the gym I always get funny looks people who like advice and children because it to you so with these you about just putting your hands behind your head you elbow to your opposite your knee to your opposite elbow so we crunch over so we just a little bit different movement but it about crunching down getting some speed here but it just changes the dynamic of what you the ground okay so that one that that one for about 30 45 seconds take a quick rest send us your other two sets okay side plank crunch two leg lifts I am a huge advocate for side planks that tends to be a weaker place for a lot of people in the obliques so what we is we plank we crunching and the leg lift crunch lift our leg crunch lift so as I through these motions try to think about keeping this at the same level not allowing that to kind of sink down everything crunching forward lifting crunch left alright obviously once you with one side get the other side okay in the last one just to get some metabolic in there a little bit more kind of a rotational getting that nice tapering look we rotational mountain climber so instead of the traditional here I want you to think about just kind of bringing the knees off to the side towards the opposite elbow put in a fast pace

How To Get a Rounder Butt (FROM FLAT TO FABULOUS!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSy3UxJbqDA	ATHLEAN - X	hey you guys so whether it genetics weight loss or inactivity secretly we shapelier bottom so I workout that flat to fabulous here we go [Music] how are you guys so most importantly what you want to do before you do any kind of glute workout is you want to make sure you want to grab any kind of bands which I just realize I don but normally what you can do is just take some bands and you put bands around your ankles and you can just do like a side shuffle you can do monster walks you can get on the ground and you can do clam shells or even just standing and doing any kind of abductor or kick out anything to just kind of get them kind of waking waking them out basically maybe take five even five minutes of doing that it activate them get them ready to go okay so that going to start with five different exercises that I think are really good for kind of targeting kind of the entire glute area because that main thing that we on getting built up and it doesn always necessarily mean using a ton of weight you don and just slam on all these weights the main key is if you the glute your cemento typically holding that glute in that position to where it that how you think you just because you gym slapping on a ton of weight and squatting and doing all that it gonna happen for you because that true if you through your reps nice and slow and really engaging that muscle you see the results okay you guys so the first thing I banded you can use so if you have dams you can do kickbacks with pounds or if you have a cable system you can use a cop or anything to get your foot inside you want to set at you know not a super heavy weight just to a moderate weight something you feel comfortable using now with this one I always tell people it to keep that tabletop back I see people in the gym and their hyperextending you don get yourself to where you feel like you abs are engaged and you think about bringing that leg up not too high up here you want to keep a straight line so down and kicked where you really feel that top part of the glute really engaging and like I said even just that little bit of an isometric hold it really it happen but again you want to use some weight that the muscle so if this depending on how much weight you baby anywhere from 10 TT I would do three on one side reset and do the opposite side I love those because I really feel like it just gets it really activated and kind of ready to go another one of my favorites they super easy but they single legs Swiss ball squat so you just going to take a ball put it against the wall I mean these are great if you have too much trouble doing one leg even two leg it you into a deeper range of motion and that really engages the hamstrings and the glutes so to make it the tougher the one-leg you going to put here the leg out in front of you other leg is just going to be up front some people prefer it behind whatever you feel the most comfortable doing and you and to think about using the ball I really pressing against that if I using this to my advantage to help me get lower and I driving through my glutes but this worldly taxes that backside it really makes those hamstrings and glutes do a lot of work just do as many as you can even if it three rounds that make sure we hit both sides just going down as low as we possibly can obviously a 90 degree angle would be optimum and we can to balance and go as low as you can slow and controlled okay see where did that guy okay single leg deadlift this one is challenging for your balance but it so you believe you grab your dumbbells you front what you exercise it about hinging at the waist as it is kicking your leg out almost like a lever almost like your leg is connected to your upper body and they all work in unison together so I glutes they to keep a slight bend in my leg and I gonna drive up I top leg out because that keep me in a straight line by locking that top leg out that even more plus it glute of the non-working leg - all right so we anywhere from 12 to 15 really think about driving up through the glute not just lifting your body think about the muscle you through that leg all right so remember 12 to 15 on one leg I try to do three rounds to just keep that muscle engage the whole time I my other leg next we single leg squat to bench okay so with this one you can if you have a chair at home anything like that works - I weight initially so maybe just sit down first kind of find your marking of where you one foot out in front of you you gonna sit back and raise back and raise so just a little tap and back up kind of driving through that back part of my legs if you want to make it a little bit tougher you can add a a weight you can hold a dumbbell or a plate do the same thing we straight up and up so I really feel that I hamstrings right up into the base of my glutes and 12 to 15 on each side three rounds other leg okay I always want to do something that abala because that some but targeting tips you guys use elevation so if you try to get some elevation going because you walking on elevation than you are flat ground it the glutes a little bit more running hills stair steppers are great or even stairs so if you up stairs at home or at work there for you to use and then a super good for building the glutes okay so this last one this is really good it it fat all of that stuff so you going to pop up stay low and low so we glutes engaged so at this one 15 to 20 rounds I want you to do three to five rounds of your finisher nice gentle landing you don far just a nice nice gentle landing all right you guys there is hope I recently lost a little bit of weight that was the one place I did notice I lost weight so it was like oh my gosh I really have to start working my glutes a lot more because before you just you know it like I said you know there that layer and then there so if you sudden you I had a a back sight before but it gone so really good targeting exercises think about targeting your glutes at least times a week and really hit them hard and it doesn with heavy weights just really engaging the muscle is all you guys need to do thanks for joining me today hit the like button subscribe you leave a comment hey and check us out on a kleenex sex for women calm thanks for joining me you guys and we	Success

How To Define Your Shoulders | Best SHOULDER SCULPTING Techniques	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjQeUkCh874	ATHLEAN - X	today we front the middle and rear delts today to create rounded shapely shoulders our goal is to overload the muscles for size and growth so focusing on lifting heavier weights with good form is what we [Music] hey guys so we with those nice rounded shoulders and it lot of these exercises I you today will hopefully get you there think about using a little bit heavier weight kind of pushing yourself because that those shoulders okay the first exercise we with today is a front dumbbell raise we delts which is this muscle right in through here let actually I need to grab another 15 sorry make sure you though so with this one a lot of times you here which is fine but really the anterior delt is the small muscle here so focusing on getting a little bit of an angle or a crossbody is really going to target that muscle better so think about when you over in front of your body because that that anterior delt better than just doing a straight race so depending on your weight 10 to 12 reps you want to think about keeping your abs fully engaged and I controlling that weight on the way down not letting it just bow fall down to my legs so I getting that cross body lift all right three rounds of that okay so we can going to move to the middle delt so this is gonna be the larger muscle off to the side this one I stuff a little bit over here grab this 20 with this one I usually use a cable something that allows me to get a little bit of a lean and then what you to do is you having just a slight bend in your elbow and you lifting the elbow lifting the elbow at the slight bend in it slowly controlling as you lower lowering you don just swing it you don hoof it and swing it controlling the movement but making it tough oh those are tough okay we gonna go baby ten to 12 on each side three rounds okay next kneeling dumbbell shoulder press okay these we can probably go a little bit heavier some people will do these standing some people do that was sitting I am a fan of just doing them on my knee number one because I feel like I keeping my abs engaged sometimes I feel like the chair kind of just hammers the shoulder movement so I just use my own body so what we just going to bring these up and I prefer doing an alternating because I think you can get a better range of motion so my glute on this side is super tight it abs are engaged on the stay fully straight up through my shoulders in my head and you about bringing that dumbbell straight up really pressing up so what you do you however many reps 10 to 12 to 15 I want you to think about switching over because your dominant side is always going to be wanting to kind of let it do its thing so this is my weaker side to my core so this is actually a little bit more challenging so press up okay three rounds of that you guys alright and now that the entire adult area that of hitting everything the next one we gonna do is a laying reverse fly on a bench I love this one because it really focuses on that rear delt that that rounded shape in your shoulders so it an easy one to neglect but he doesn take a lot of weight so you don to use a lot of weight for this so I want you to think about keeping the neutral the head you looking up usually I just kind of put my nose on the bench make sure hitting my other weight since I and I arms out think about birds wings as you this you straight arm think about a bird wing with that nice little kind of slight Bend and think about raising up with the backs of your shoulders [Music] this is really gonna focus on that rear delt area so I would say three sets of 12 to 15 that one we have to have some kind of body weight it doing a V pushup is this going to totally focus on the entire shoulder area so what you gonna do is you your hands out in front of you I kind of go up on my toes a little bit my hands are about a little wider than shoulder width apart I under and I the ground and I trying to keep my elbows in so I really pushing through the tops of my shoulders in the front pressing all the way up lowering down as far as I possibly can so to make those tougher you can progressively put your feet on a box or a bench because that give a lot more height and add a lot more resistance to having to get that push-up done okay you guys these are some of my favorite shoulder exercises don because if you want to get that nice kind of rounded look that gonna have to do you add some weight we think about getting some good cardio men consistently getting in the gym and once again looking at our diet making sure we and that should hopefully be a plan to reach your goal thanks for joining me today you guys hey hit the like button subscribe but leave us a comment hey check out a kleenex X for women comm and join us on Facebook and Instagram thanks you guys see you soon	Success

Lose LOWER BELLY Fat (5 Moves To FLATTEN LOW ABS!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnFsoP1hc_U	ATHLEAN - X	it women today we contributing factors and targeting exercises for losing lower belly fat [Music] Hey ladies I know how tough it is to lose that lower belly fat it problem area for a lot of us I know it can be just an endless cycle of exercises and what am I supposed to eat so let the contributing factors we definitely know body fat is one of them so you really need to make sure you reduce your overall body fat percentage to really see any results within your stomach area because we all know you can reduce so basically you just need to have a good workout a good healthy clean diet making sure we about eating clean foods maybe 80 or 90 percent of the time that to be a helpful to lose that body fat we want to make sure we good cardio through throughout the week whether you plyometrics whatever it is just getting that heart rate up and I think all of that kind of wrapped with a bow of consistency is really going to be helpful some other factors are going to be underdeveloped abdominal muscles so let a while maybe you pregnancies whatever your issues might be that can be another contributing factor to kind of that little pooch and posture and pelvic tilt can be also another factor causing a little bit of a pooch I definitely have a little bit of a tilt with mine so I notice unless I kind of working on that it little pooch in the front no matter how lean or whatever exercises I so those I know can be factors so why don that really target that area so the first thing we a reverse plank hover so with this one I like where my feet have a little bit of room to slide you can actually put a towel under your feet that makes it a little bit easier this is a reverse plank hover so you your feet straight in front of you your hands are going to be off to your side you body up and you about pulling your hips back through which is really gonna target those lower abdominals so I up actually we slide for me let hands are on the ground I up and I my hips through I sitting back down small movement that boy it does a lot of work pretty amazing so I and shoulders fairly high I to crunch in and push back out that that actually takes a lot of work to the Amaze when you get on the ground and you do these so let from five to ten and three rounds I want you to do these I another so once you to 10 I want you to take maybe a 20 30 second rest do round 2 do round 3 it taxes the muscle instead of doing this circuit style I want you to just stay focused on that particular exercise okay now we crisscross lift switch so at this one you we about a 90 degree angle I right leg over my left I bring this up bringing my hips up high I letting my feet touch the ground I switching over and I towards the ceiling lowering down I really not even lowering that close to the ground and then I and lowering so I with each exercise whew okay next we reverse crunch so this is even gonna get us more into a reverse crunch so one leg is gonna be bent the other is gonna be straight I this is like it gonna come over the top of my head as far as I can get it to go I don right now I switching bringing the other leg over really crunching in and once again really controlling that lowering down I are pretty much doing all of the work with the knees exercises here okay so once again I want you to think about doing eight to ten twelve reps if you can rest maybe fifteen twenty seconds go into round two and round three okay next we these I want you to always think about keeping your legs at about a ninety five degree angle you feet together you you you don once again that lower abdominals act activated so I gonna be here out to here so that where you about 45 degree angle bringing the feet together and then really squeezing and back out that right in to the bottom of those lower abdominals eight to twelve reps rest two to three rounds okay lastly we to do half Turkish you get it with this one I am gonna add some resistance I believe in adding resistance to exercises this is a good one to do that you can start light penny depending on your fitness level with this one we going to have the same event as the arm is straight and we up and we rolling the ABS all the way back down sitting straight up and rolling back down so once I twelve reps I can take a short break I all the way up really thinking about doing that slow on the way down moment negative all the way down alright so those are three really good lower ab targeted exercises so keeping these in your workout a couple times a week being consistent with your diet getting some good cardio in being consistent within the gym or just being consistent overall with being active I really think you looking for I know it gets tough a lot of times that weight and especially for women so just stick with it do the best you can and thanks for joining me today you guys hey I hope you media and I will work out with you guys soon	Success

5 PROVEN Exercises to Lift Your Breasts (100% NATURAL BUST LIFT!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVM49MXcCWQ	ATHLEAN - X	Hey ladies today I you some exercises to lift the breasts naturally all through exercise here we go [Music] hey guys so developing the mutts muscles underneath your breasts will help them look fuller and larger just by adding a little bit of extra weight and developing the muscles underneath and it also will help lift them up so working the chest from multiple angles with enough weight will actually help stimulate and increase muscle strength and develop those muscles so that of our goal today I have five different exercises we with what equipment we can kind of alternate things if you working out at home you don necessarily need a bench you could probably use just the Swiss ball or a medicine ball for that maybe lighter to moderate weight depending on your fitness level so the first thing we gonna start with is a stability ball chest press so you your ball doesn is just kind of a medium size what I gonna have you do is grab your weights and what we gonna roll our body out to where our shoulders are actually on the top of the ball with this one I sure that my abs are fully engaged my hips are up to kind of give a nice flat tabletop and then I grab my weights what get a fuller range of motion because if you about here going with doing it on the medicine ball or the Swiss ball and allows a fuller range of motion see how it chest that all we gonna press up and lower back all the way back down we back down I and I this together with my chest don think about oh I my arms because that makes it too easy I muscles to press it up and down so with this one you could do three sets of maybe twelve to fifteen all right so we so that of opens that area gets that kind of activated and ready to go the next we going to do is that dumbbell pullover that it that guy here so you lay on the ground this one I bit lighter weight so we to lay flat you about keeping a straight arm up and overhead my abs are engaged and you just going to think about lowering the weights down to the ground and then you towards the ceiling and I feeling the bottom of my PEC muscles pushing the weights up so this is a really really good exercise for really getting that underneath area I point that out I muscles here gauging and working to get those dumbbells up and straight so a nice slow lower and then I thinking about using those muscles to pull up so once again we to 15 reps three rounds okay next we pulls some of my favorites so we gonna think about standing with our feet about shoulder width apart maybe a little wider nice tight core and really you here you back as you come forward you gonna bring your elbows together so your back and elbows together really thinking about squeezing those chest muscles together as you together I mean I it I nice elbows are kind of back and just bringing those together with a nice squeeze and squeeze squeeze really kind of hitting the entire front chest area just great 12 to 15 about three rounds for those okay next we a roundabout push-ups so this is another good one so you the ground these you on your knees so you pretend like you regular push-up but with this one you gonna think about almost creating a circle so what you just going to lower down and you gonna shift from side to side kind of just getting those close to the ground as you can and shifting over so what it the muscles a little bit differently than just going straight down in a regular pushup so once again we sweeping and lifting sweeping and lifting like I said just go as low as you can I know those are tougher if you can 12 to 15 that 4 to 5 rest and do your other sets of those perfectly fine ok last thing we gonna do is an alternating dumbbell chest fly for that one I have a bench and I for that so what we just going to lay on the bench we going to make sure that our neck is supported our back is straight I usually bring my knees up just to protect the lower back we our hands straight up and this is an alternating fly so we just going to actually know it let have our feet down with alternating it going to want to pull your body to one side so you one side you your elbow the whole time and think about really using that chest to pull it up almost like you like scooping it to keep that nice rounded shoulder and elbow getting a nice deep range of motion bringing the arm down as far as it feels comfortable really engaging that chest pectoral muscle so one that we today so we 12 to 15 on each side so those are really good notice I definitely feel are really targeting that area okay ladies hopefully this was helpful and really think about when you exercises to make that mind-body connection don to do to do really think about using that that particular muscle to do the work obviously our arm is bringing the dumbbell in but if we our chest doing most of the work that the muscle we that work that

constantly keeping that pressure it be a lot it just going to press out so the lower your legs are when you it taxing on your abs if that think about lifting those up a little bit higher then you putting as much strain on your abs if you have a little bit maybe the weaker core system your abs aren just think about going up higher so just think about pressing those feet together should really

knees here our hands are going to be back behind our head we lower down we side and we really working through here and when I reaching it I more pressure on that particular muscle as I reason I obliques too but it actually makes this side work and then it switches over to make the other side work a little bit harder so we reaching and down reach reach and up so even with just a few I you guys I already have a nice little burn going the last we a little bit more metabolic just working out within your range of comfort you don bit of a jump off ground is good we all know that for women

How To Improve Your Balance (STEP BY STEP GUIDE!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6_qZQMuBgE	ATHLEAN - X	Hey ladies were going to talk about how to improve your balance today [Music] okay you guys we to improve your balance I advocate for balance I to incorporate it in my workouts not only with myself but what find working with clients no matter the age whether I something really something you never want to lose so if you keeping that my workout this is gonna be a great video for you because we gonna just show step by step how you can gradually get it to be better so we need to remember balances the key to all functional movements so balance training should challenge your ability to stabilize outside your normal base of support so your proprioception or sense of physical self and what is what allows you to move so a good sense of proprioception can improve your balance and coordination as well as your physical capabilities meaning that gonna help you with just your normal workouts it easier so here we four different tips to help develop and improve your balance okay number one what I always tell everybody think like a kid so remember when you were a toddler or a little bit older maybe an elementary school your friend everyone running around going crazy jumping climbing landing on one foot who can balance and walk on the corner of the sandbox all of that stuff they were there tapping into their appropriate ception their balance all of that stuff stabilization so I try to tell people think about doing the same things with your workouts now it to run around like a crazy person in the gym doing stuff like that but just you know add things into your workout a lot of times I doing curls stand and do everything on one leg I if I awkward to me so just make it a routine even if you brushing your teeth something super number two incorporate an unstable yet controllable environment so here options right here we board most gyms will have these we have a dyno disk super-great love using these and a good old BOSU ball that you can either use that way or you can flip it upside down so all of these are great options in your gym to basically kind of help you get your body used to being in an unstable environment so you always want to start in a safe controllable environment before you work up do something a little bit tougher so something like a balanced board initially of course you may want to maybe hold onto a wall or something because it is a little bit pretty it pretty unstable Dino just the same thing this is this is great for doing lunges on or maybe it leg here a lot of a lot of times I see people working up by doing squats so these are all really great options fairly safe options okay third create a training program so first what I want you to think about is I want you to start with a stabilizing balanced exercise so this is like just getting your stabilization system down teaching your body how do I even balance so the first exercise you can do a single leg balance you leg your core is going to be tight your head and shoulders is gonna be back you weight and literally you bring your leg up it looks simple but my core is doing a lot of work and I really kind of finding my Center so I been hold that maybe 20 seconds 30 seconds do the same thing on the opposite leg this is Aldous billing in or stabilization and down to make it a little bit tougher you go into a single leg reach so you going to just balance on one leg you just going to bend over with opposite hand and try to reach that toe the other leg is just being kicked back behind you so it so that bit trickier so I would recommend maybe doing 8 to 10 on each side so once you for quite a while I this isn a couple of weeks we you level exercises so now we talk about doing a lunge to balance so what you would do is you lunge forward you stabilize lunch forward knee as close to the ground as you can push back and stabilize so my core is nice and tight my shoulders are up as I exercise so we explosiveness there but it of a strength based exercise ok next we touchdown so with this one similar to the first one but a little bit tougher because we into a deep squat I and I taking a lot more strength through that leg and back to start so really think about kind of keeping that Center keeping the core tight the whole time lastly we would go into our power level exercises these are definitely going to be more explosive once again as I have mentioned stability I would recommend working a lot on that that could take you months then you into it months or even longer this isn then you develop over a couple of weeks so lastly when she kind of developed everything else your stabilization systems down your strength levels there then you move into your power so with these you could do like a multilateral hopless table stabilization so we can start and by multi planner I meaning full not only full range of motion but all planes of motion so it would be jumping forward and back so it explosive landing and controlling that lateral hop and control so I controlling these movements here and then the last would be more of your rotational which could be a little bit tougher and here and lastly you can do a single leg leg hop with stabilization so you could stand in front of the box you pork step off the box to stabilize and down so these may look simple but these are actually it takes a lot of work to learn how to kind of stabilize last and the most importantly core stabilization is critical really make sure that you have some good core exercises in your workouts they that strong midsection that you need to do these exercises whether it a lot of lateral movements here all of that is critical and when you balance things I always tell everybody don I see a lot of people like I off so give the temps up it thing to do I immediately relax if I feel like I instantly relax get my Center and that how I catch my balance so do the opposite of what your body wants you to don Center all right you guys I hope this was helpful please please PLEASE work on your balance I can critical this is to get a good workout in also it progress in your workouts and you get really strong and it will carry you through life thanks for joining me today check out a saline xx for women hey check us out on social media our Facebook page or Instagram page

a ton of vegetables not only are they good for you they all those good things but that your weight loss journey is going to start in the kitchen number two strength train to boost your metabolism so we all know the more lean muscle that you put on the warrior body your furnace is just cranking during the day even when you that resistive training Bert working those muscles you those calories even when you the gym that and then that think oh I to burn this off I need to be able to finding five or ten 20 miles a day that it boost your metabolism which is gonna be strength training resistive training all of those are key factors and slimming your thighs down so let exercises here we want to focus on five exercises today a lot of these are going to focus on our legs but some of them are also going to be a full-body and explosive exercises which are good because what going to jack up our metabolism and also we also want to think about going with a lighter weight and higher reps because the goal is to lean out and not really really get bulky with our legs a lot of times I really heavy and they their legs aren because if you type is already you put muscle I really easy and you more muscle it little bit bulkier and a little bit heavier so think about lightening the weight up and doing more reps because that to get that slum earth eye look we don want to go like super heavy weight okay so let really good ones okay with this one you can use a light weight this is a plie squat so at this one we externally rotating our feet out we want to keep a fairly wide stance with this one I the other thing with this is you want to think about almost kind of rotating your pelvis in just slightly that protect your back so I doing a slight pelvis tilt I down I my knees tracking over my toes so everything stays in alignment even though are rotated out they alignment we squat here and then I just want you to go into five chumps one two three four five so once again this is going to be a timed workout you clock for 30 to 45 seconds depending on your abilities taking a 20 second rest so if you your time still up you going you until your full time is up so that gonna kind of really break your legs up okay what to go into a Cossack squat with this one you stance what you just going to lower down to one side as you this leg out and lift that toe so I lowering down and lifting my toe I little bit tighter in that hip so you can tell I range of motion so the other side we going to lower down lift the toe and I pressing up and thinking about using the sides of my legs as I getting it a little bit of gluten hamstring but that alright so you the full 30 to 45 seconds really think about trying to sit back try to push my backside out and up alright next we scissor or plank scissor leg lengths ok so with these we plates we your feet you position you straight back neutral head tight core and all we feet and pushing them in and out my shoulders are over my hands I my feet into the ground because that giving me a little more resistance so I inner and outer thighs 30 to 45 seconds okay weighted lateral one inch off the Box another one of my favorites I would say start with a very low box because this is a little bit more explosive you can hold weight or no weight at all so you you off to the side and exactly this position here my knees are tracking over my feet and then I to come up you can either stand on the box or just a lot of times I landing morley pushing up with that leg so I really telling this one the most when my abductors my outside outer thigh high so I I and I not only am i hitting the area I concerned about but my heart rates up this is good my full body is involved with that one okay last we a huge believer in plyometrics that all I do when I want to lean out or after all of my workouts because it gets my heart rate up I entire body I legs I try to do things that are getting my upper body my core my legs everything okay so play metrics squat our hands are gonna be back behind our head we going to think about keeping our feet a little bit wider than shoulder-width apart and this is an explosive movement we landing landing on the Front toes first let me get my hair away think about a nice deep range of motion getting that butt back behind you and explosively jumping up 30 to 45 seconds of work 20 seconds rest max on those three to five rounds all right so I hope a lot of these tips are helpful I know it times with aging or it can be something genetically hormones play a huge factor there we tend to hold that in certain areas sometimes that wants to put it you can start losing weight but you except for that last area that be the last place to go but I guarantee if you stick to a clean diet you working your entire body you some strength training some resistive training you burning throughout the day you to see changes you just have to be a really diligent and consistent okay guys thanks for joining me today

5 Reasons Your Glutes ArenÂt Growing (GLUTE GAINS SECRET!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKfUT1GLySw	ATHLEAN - X	everybody trainer Susan with affen XX so you pushing hard you glutes to grow and no matter what you do it just doesn any gains let in just a [Music] minute hey you guys so my first bit of advice is to be patient and keep working at it so must MUSC growth and development takes time and results of your hard work well it can take a while to show so don secondly consider your muscle growth and training performance is very much determined by correct nutrition that could have a lot to do with it also so why no gains number mistake number one it can be no glute Activation so let say you walk over and boom you rack after you your glutes are turned off they firing at all and you God what is what good news is is that there a to a way to wake up the glutes and that drills before you start your leg workout it can be as easy as putting bands around your legs and doing band walks you can do lateral band walks you can do monster walks any of this stuff uh clam shells on the ground where you bringing your legs together here is a good one anything to get glute Bridge glute bridges are good anything to just kind of get those glutes fired and waking up especially like I said if you they completely shut off so really think about the number one priority when you get in the gym on L day I my um my glutes activated by just doing you know 5 10 15 minute little series of of things to get them firing mistake number two sitting all day like I mentioned so this keeps your glutes actually shut down so think about getting up during the day maybe not calling somebody you know two buildings away get up walk to them plus long hours of sitting it puts our hips in constant flexed position that so get up stretch out do anything you can go in the break room do some lifts here anything you can do you know as you to keep them firing throughout the day even walking anything to just kind of get them get them woken up number three uh you glute work so you may want to designate one day as kind of your glute day so you can think of um just doing a lot of bilateral exercises or unilateral exercises and that work those three muscle groups so really think about doing that maybe I do specifically my glut workout today that way we need to you know I all these other other things are going on um mistake number four hitting them heavy and hitting them hard in truth your glutes will hardly activate unless you make a concerted effort to engage them um during the lift so if you lifting super heavy they on yeah it before you motions other your quads might be taking over if you you just working your quads and your glutes are just fast asleep back there so think about using lighter loads slow your Tempo focus on actively Contracting your glutes on every rep try holding the weight for a few seconds count at the top of each rep so there you can change up that make a huge difference number five you one plane of force so as we all know the glutes have three different mus muscle groups we the medius so we really want to make sure that we especially the Minimus and Max and um medius and the Minimus those two are a little bit tougher to hit but they make a big difference so movements like squats deadlifts hip hip thrusts they all train in one capacity basically hip extension so this negates the glutes other roles such as lateral stabilizers external rotators at the thigh hip abductors and posterior pelvic um so there happening that we really need to think about instead of always just kind of being here in this front sagittal position so the fix do exercises like Bulgarian split squats uh a coac squat lateral lunges are all great great ways to kind of get those U gluteus Minimus and medius fired up so the top three tips that I have for growing your glutes are number one isolating them number two feeding them with your diet and number three hit all three glute muscles frequently so I going to just go through three different exercises and these are not even like super heavy weighted exercises cuz like I mentioned earlier it them activated it you you okay so the first one we start with is a single leg hip thrust this seems to be the popular thing I see people with super heavy barbells and all that stuff you don do that necessarily if especially if you doing my body weight I can really feel that I slower Tempo I top and that glute to grow so we oursel in position here our back is up our head is always forward I leg planted and then I my hip down and I really able to really focus on holding that glute and I can tell that that the muscle I engaged fully engaging right now I think if you and if you want to um hold weight that great but a lot of times you really don that weight to grow your glutes it like I said it muscle really holding and getting that that muscle to really fire and and be used because a lot of times I go saying it may not even be be used if you doing heavy squats so just doing that right there I really felt my glute was engaged if I of 15 or so I I can tell that to make a big difference in my glute workout number two lateral lunges so with this one you can either use weight or no weight so this is a great movement for hitting the glute muscles especially the medius which is here on the side so what we just going to reach out kicking the back side and popping up this is great for hamstrings too because as we all know you have to have good hamstrings to have good glutes so we popping back to start so I can really feel I that muscle on the side of my glute so you want to think about pushing up with that kind of back part of your glute so same thing on the other side kicking the back side out out and think about pushing back to the top through the glute all right and last exercise and then once again we moving in different planes we always staying forward it lateral even things transverse are really good always think about working the muscle a little bit differently the last one is another one of my favorites the good old Bulgarian and split squat this is where you your rear foot elevated I tend to keep my front foot closer because I think the farther you get out I think you just tend to work the your quads that want to really make sure we the glutes here so with this one I always try to focus on getting my knee as close to the ground as possible because that glute right here is engaging and I pressing up through my glute if my foot to want to use my quad more so we dropping down and we straight up touching that knee down it side this is definitely more of the maxim pushing my body up and with that one you can do a moderate weight sometimes I like a 25 35 lb plate just getting down once again even just slowing your Tempo and I always try to hold at the bottom just for a second before I come back up there little tricks so don should be pressured in the gym to have this huge barbell on your back doing these squats that may not even be doing any good because your glutes are not activated you muscle there really think about that the next time you think about activation and really targeting the glute whether it changing up your exercises maybe taking some of the weight away and really making sure you contraction of the muscle you that isometric hole all of these little things are going to add upo okay you guys I hope that was helpful uh thanks for joining me today hey check out athleen XX women.com leave any comments any other videos maybe you other issues you you

How To Fix DIASTASIS RECTI | Abdominal Separation | 4 Best EXERCISES & What To AVOID!!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AufO48E262s	ATHLEAN - X	Hey ladies today we talking about diastasis recti which is an abdominal separation you get usually with pregnancy [Music] hey so today we about diastasis recti so what this is as diastasis means separation recti refers to your ab muscles called the rectus abdominals so what the dice with diastasis recti it fairly common condition and women especially I I of the rectus abdominis muscles actually split apart in the midline fasciae so what you this is they here sometimes it can happen here but generally it here and there are different widths some people will have the two fingers or three people through three finger so it can really vary depending on the condition in the person so if the symptoms of so it symptom of excessive or unsupported intra-abdominal pressure so what happens is the belly sticks out because the space between the left and the right of the belly has widened so it common like I mentioned among pregnant women and about two-thirds of pregnant pregnant women actually get this so the best time to actually start strengthening your core is actually before you get pregnant but if you already have this then you really want to make sure you steps to condition in the proper way so first you want to what you want to do is you want to test to make sure that you actually have it and there great videos on YouTube that can show you how to do it it test it just it takes a few minutes to see if you actually have it or you can check with your OBGYN most people usually you can tell that you have it but it test first before starting any kind of at work out at all so just very quickly the exercises you want to avoid you absolutely want to avoid a standard crunch so that would be that smush here so on the ground you absolutely do not want to be doing any kind of standard crunch what it does is it severely increases the intra-abdominal pressure so it organs outward against and through the gap and actually downward into the pelvic floor so you really want to make sure you even just like a regular sit-up same thing we don of twisting anything here you absolutely do not want to do any kind of twisting planking this isn do planking either it just puts too much pressure on the abdominal walls so I just going to run through really quickly four different exercises you can do at home just to help you gently start engaging the deep core stabilizers the pelvic floor muscles all of the muscles that have separated and that needs just very gradual gentle strengthening okay so the first thing we with is a pelvic tilt so we lay on the floor our knees are gonna be bent our palms are gonna be up we gonna think belly button to spine we just going to gently rotate our hips up towards our face so normally I would say have your head and a neutral spine relaxed on the ground I want to talk up to you guys so just kind of know your head should be on the ground and fully relaxed here so you just going to think about raising and just kind of lifting that spine a little bit but it just gently tilting my pelvis towards my face it it really doesn you very deep lower muscles here relaxing and I I up so you can see it slight tilt and relaxed tilt and I really try to engage those muscles kind of clinch them up and relax so once again there really critical muscles to work on those deep core stabilizers those pelvic floor muscles okay the next we a heel slide this one is all about stability stabilizing through the core our knees are going to be bent our shoulders are going to be shoulder width apart our palms are going to be up neutral spine navel to the spine once again so we engage in the whole time what you gonna do is you your heel gonna bring this up because my kids not gonna slide how do I take my shoes off okay just so you gotta kind of get a little bit more of a slide with these so I off really quickly okay so we down here we up and you little bit of pressure in the ground we we where that navel to spine you want to think about our belly button to spine nose we bringing that up I muscles here those deep core muscles those stabilizing muscles so I bringing my knee up I off the ground I pressure but I those deeper lower muscles doing the work there it doesn doing a lot but you like even just doing that little bit I did okay next we lift we everything is going to be bent knees palms up neutral spine belly button to spine so with this one this time now we a knee raise so think about controlling this not only up but down especially on the down I could really feel that lower muscle he are doing a lot of work so with all of these I want you to think about doing maybe eight to ten reps so I slowly lone rings because that I these when I really feeling it through those deep core stabilizers so the stronger you get that feet and lower and you feel it when you and lower belly button to spine and lower ooh really good okay our last one we so we you between your knees so you palms up this is actually going to be working the intra pelvic floor muscles and we the abductor muscles our inner thigh so I head my belly button to spine my palms are up I squeezing that pillow as hard as I can bring my knees together and I relaxed squeeze that pillow together the best that you can not only my feeling that in my inner thigh I feeling that in my my really low rectus abdominis at the very bottom and I relaxing so think about anywhere from maybe eight to ten squeezes relax squeeze again as hard as you can just really think about trying to squeeze your knees together through that pillow and relaxing so eight to ten reps try to think about doing three maybe three rounds of each of these exercises and trying to do this workout five times a week because we you don remember it at the same time hey ladies thanks for joining me today I hope you found this video helpful please make sure

How To IMPROVE YOUR POSTURE | Fix Rounded Shoulders | 5 Best Exercises!!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjPYv-cGU	ATHLEAN - X	everybody today we exercises to help you have better posture [Music] okay so today focus on getting better posture either by stretching or strengthening of the muscles many women suffer from rounded shoulders maybe due to their a heavy bustline or just sitting in a computer all day so we kind of start getting that rounded look so we counteract that by strengthening the posterior muscles in our back okay we gonna start with some stretching though because a lot of times a lot of the issues are actually just maybe muscles that are shortened and some that are lengthened and were weakened and these are possibly more shortened to the stronger muscles okay so we gonna do a wall chest stretch you just going to walk over to any wall if you the wall once you have your hand there you body to try to get it forward go with whatever your range of motion is there no guideline to how far you should be able to turn the goal is to just start getting that nice stretch and really opening the area here because this is the muscle that tends to be shortened and tight so think about just really relaxing into that and you can hold this anywhere from 20 seconds once you done that you opposite hand so I have any shoulder injuries I actually have a shoulder injury so that could be good to show that I very good range of motion so see I only able to really go here until it feels uncomfortable for me so if you have any discomfort and you really can get the body fully straight like possibly your other side that gonna work on this site and hopefully if you have any injuries you you just kind of continually keep stretching it out relaxing but don overly push on that to get it to strain the muscle at all so once we do that we things stretched out another one of my favorite stretches to help get that area opened up we swings so super simple hands are just gonna be palms down and we just do an alternating crisscross in front of our so what i really opening that thoracic area i stretching that out and I starting to tone back here a little bit because you those shoulder blades together then it actually working the muscle there so this is that counteracting I about we strengthening and really tightening the muscles in the back and toning so these you can do a couple sets I would go 30 seconds you can rest for maybe 10 or 15 seconds you can go into round 2 just like the wall stretch I you do 2 or 3 rounds of that really make sure we get a good warm-up and stretch and this is something you can do at work too if you noticing your shoulders are coming forward get up to a wall stretch do these scissor swings so I difference cuz you have to imagine it takes time for our body to develop ly get this way so if we counteract that every day that happen okay next we a single arm rattle because with this once again we strengthening the muscles back here to help pull our chest area back open so I gym you if you have cables however you want to do it I just have this hooked around a secure leg on my couch to make this more level with my chest I gonna get on one knee and I row this back and I about getting my scapular area engaged here really pulling that back I just site so you can see a little bit better so I shoulder blade back I really strengthening the back and stretching the front and I really recommend doing one arm workouts especially with rows because a lot of time everything we do is here but it good to let the body work individually and I think you get a little bit range of motion here so with these once again we on each side really stretching back keeping a good posture kind of neutral head once we finish that we rest and we can go right in to the opposite side and doing about three rounds of that okay so this we go on the ground and we into what what I love about this is it also helps strengthen our lower back too because that can become a weak area to over sitting a lot so once again this is going to really focus on the backs of our shoulders because once again if they weakened they hold our shoulders back which can cost that rounding we ground our feet can be slightly apart our arms are just going to be back behind our head and you slightly raise up into an isometric hold once you get there you lower and raise your elbows this doesn look like it guarantee thirty seconds of this I backs of my shoulders which tend to be a little weaker for most people a neutral hand I keeping my head in a neutral spine and we that we then I want you to go into a second and third round you little burn on the back of your shoulder okay last thing we scapular push up so you is you hands and knees as if you were going to do a regular pushup so the difference with the scapular push-up is you in any way you arms locked out and I think about sinking down bringing my shoulder area those scapular blades together and then I press so it scapular area so we of toning and tightening that area back there really targeting that particular area so pushing through just letting my chest collapse as I bring those together the best I can and push them up towards the ceiling we thirty seconds you can rest for 20 to 30 seconds and do three rounds of that so I really hope you guys keep this workout in like I here all day and you anything to really counteract all of this posterior kind of things that are making you hunchy and kind of crunched over all the time so that saying I have these in you know every day every other day get that get your back tire tightened and toned and we going to strengthen those lengthened muscles will really make a big difference okay you guys hey check out athlean-x x from women comp for all

How To Do SQUATS FOR BEGINNERS | Correct Form & Mechanics | STEP BY STEP GUIDE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otzWCWpuW-A	ATHLEAN - X	hey you guys today we by step to teach you guys how to do squats for my beginners here we go [Music] so the squat is the king of all exercises you and develop strength in your core width which will translate into overall better performance so this lower body move primarily works and strengthen strengthens the hips the glutes the hamstrings quads and indirectly the ABS so squats are going to work your entire body and your core the same way a plank does but it so it full body exercise one of them one of the good ones okay so first thing we about we bottom and work our way up we to talk about feet positioning so what we I so you can totally see what I here our feet should be a little wider than shoulder-width apart so once you get that then you about just slightly turning your toes outward just slightly though not we not talking plie just a very slight rotation of your feet outward so the wider your stance is then your shoulder what this is going to do it your feet in this in a stance that it gonna allow the pressure on the sides of your feet to unable to enact all of all of those targeting muscles so that we in here a little bit too close to that doesn little bit wider than shoulder width or feet are going to just be slightly turned out okay next we about hip hinge a lot of people don really think about how critical this is so once we feet a little bit wider than shoulder width apart we slightly rotated out the hip hinge so with this what you you with your hips so before you think about even Benny jeez I pushing my hips backward and then I gonna descend into my squat and that gonna allow my knees to stay back behind my toes because a lot of times if we thinking about getting starting with our knees bending first they over the toes that looking for so once we gonna think about kicking our backside out then we that proper position that glutes back here really activated so if there think about I first and then I bending okay so next we about the spine the lumbar spine this is another critical piece and this can be a lot of times they see people kind of hyper extending their backs so they have a bar here and then I see them maybe starting the two band first but then I see the back kind of being pushed out here yeah you don you don back so what you want to do is you want to think about keeping your back fairly straight or just it you shouldn pushed up so our feet are here our feet are slightly rotated or hinging back but I I from my lower back lumbar back here I not kind of pushing out I natural curve in my spine and just think about pushing and hinging from the waist and then I head and chest straight so that another thing don your butt out you hips so those are two very distinct things to remember because I can put a lot of pressure on your back I mean it a lot of people are like oh I squatting it a bar over your your shoulders here and you these squats it squat people don meant for your your lower back so that where you have to be really really careful hinging at the waist and just keeping that natural natural curve okay so next hip and ankle flexibility so proper squats require flexion at the ankle and your hips to really get down into that descent of a proper squat so proper flexibility of the hips and the ankles is required for proper scoring obviously so for anybody who have ankle mobility issues I have trouble with flexion and my ankles because of years of gymnastics so what I do is I just slightly elevate my ankles just I take a very thin weight I just do the same position with my feet a little wider than shoulder-width apart slightly rotated here that with my ankles where I flexion where it into a 90 degree squat as I stop about here it because I don ankle it just it working on it though so if you find yourself not getting into that 90 degree angle this is maybe what you need to do until you can get that flexion there so now so much easier but then I could drop all the way down so it how just elevating slightly is allowing my ankle to now kind of make up for that flexion that I don getting the proper range of motion okay guys so once again our feet are show slightly wider than shoulder-width apart our feet are slightly rotated out we hinging at our hip first before we start actually squatting and bending our our head and chest should be up we should have a natural spine here we not pushing our back out or hyperextending it and we down to about parallel to the ground 90 degrees and we through the heel you should feel the weight through your heels so and that this is going to apply to a bodyweight squat if you squat if you it things going to apply here hinging and dropping just everything up getting to about 90 degrees and then if you were to do it a barbell squat same thing you would just have your barbell behind you all those same mechanics are gonna apply okay guys I hope this was helpful learning the proper mechanics before going in and doing any kind of lifting is going to make your life so much better it function better you train your body to do do it properly okay I hope this was helpful you guys hey check us out on Facebook and Instagram they on there check out a clean xxxx for women comm thanks for joining me and let	Success

5 PROVEN Exercises for SCULPTED ARMS (Hit Every Angle!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwIuLb7z4qU	ATHLEAN - X	hey ladies today I five proven exercises to tone your arms [Music] all right you guys today we be hitting the biceps and triceps they respond really quickly to using any kind of resistance and strength training so try to put this into your workout at least twice a week and you get gorgeous toned arms no matter what your Fitness level is so just really quickly let so the biceps here the biceps brachii is a muscle that and it includes a short head and a long head which are basically two single muscles that work as one big muscle the other is going to be the tricep brachii we muscles back here you your long head which is in the back your medial which is right underneath the long head and then you your lateral head which is going to run on the side of your arm so just kind of knowing the different muscles and maybe kind of how they work that better idea when you exercises of gosh how am I hitting them am I doing enough angles with my exercise to actually hit all of those different heads involved in all of these muscles all right the first thing we with is bat wings and it a lot of times people call these bat wings because we start as we age or for just not working out enough they progressively start to droop so this is a great exercise I love this one so this one can be done with a fairly lightweight and what we is we completely at the waist to a flat back you down in front of you think about a neutral head not looking up you going to bring these up not really a deep row just kind of to the sides of your chest you arms out you and then you basically exactly how a bat kind of extends their wings so with this one we bit of the backs of the shoulders the posterior delt but we triceps but in a little bit different way than maybe we normally would think about a little bit of an isometric hold before we lower so with this I would say doing anywhere from 12 to 15 reps three rounds so now that we warmed up a little bit next we bicep curl so now we our biceps a little bit what I love about this one is any kind of an isometric hold is great for building strength so with these one arm is going to do a 90 degree hold as the other one curls you could do these with both feet down I usually work on my balance by raising my leg that of the arm that and then you do your 12 to 15 reps and make sure you of motion I my leg all the way back up and then as you doing this if you notice your arm down here just kind of self-correct and always try to do or keep that elbow at a 90 degree you can take a brief rest when you done with that you the same thing on the other side get your 90 degree hold and then we on the other side it biceps okay next we are going to go into triceps so I forth between muscle groups so this is another really good one I going to show you two variations the first one is going to be modified for beginners so what you just going to have your hands on the ground your shoulders above your hands and I want you to rotate to where the the crease of your elbows are out so I see how I and they so now I a little bit my elbows are going to stay super close to the sides of my body I and I elbows really keeping them super close pressing up for more advanced you just going to lift up you into a wider stance same thing making sure my elbows are rotated inward I and press back up so this is going to be a little bit tougher really filling that on the backs of my arms so with that just do as many reps as you can three rounds all right next we hammer curls so this is just another variation of a bicep curl so what this is going to do this is just going to be with the the barbells or the dumbbells rotated this way instead of here so we here I usually try to keep them at my thigh because a lot of times you can have them here and you can get this kind of swinging motion we want to really isolate them a little bit more so we we degree angle and back down you could do these alternating or you can lift both at the same time so once again it muscle a little bit differently it which is more of the peak of the bicep and down so once again maybe 12 to 15 think about it a slow eccentric lowering also is important with this one and down okay and now our last one is going to be a bent over tricep extension this is always a good one so with this one once again we the waist you low I want you to think about bringing them up to the sides of your body and then this is where we them straight up to the ceiling so here kick straight out so your elbows are glued to your side and you full extension if you could do even a one or two second isometric hold at the top really squeezing that tricep muscle that results okay five really good exercises to help tone the arms like I mentioned if you can get these into your workout even twice a week you see a big difference in your arms thanks for joining me today you guys hey check us out on social media Facebook Instagram they these great video clips every day with different exercises different videos to help you out uh like the video if you liked what you saw today

4 Worst Abs Workout Mistakes (AND TIPS FOR BETTER RESULTS!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUni347AF5M	ATHLEAN - X	hey guys amy-jo here with athlean-x x4 women and today I some tips about the wrong ways to train your abdominals and give you some tips on the right way to train your abdominals alright let [Music] I have trainer Miranda here helping me acting as a client so she demonstrate a few of the wrong ways and the tips that I want to correct and it really good for all you visual learners to just see it on someone because there want to do right if you want the most most bang for your buck out of your core exercises listen closely so this decline bench as you can see a lot of people you crunches on the bench and when they doing them they when they lower their feet okay so feet up and then she her legs and she up big no-no you never want to have the whole the tunnel you want your low back pressed flat against the bench and then you want to lay grace so then if she gonna lay grace up now right here that low back usually tends to pop up so she low back flat and then raises them up again okay and as she making sure that she the core and not her back muscles or her hip flexor muscles as well the other correction you can do to make these a little more effective as bend your knees okay so a lot of you this might be too challenging so then you would have your knees bent your heels as close to the glutes as possible and then you gonna tuck in and roll up and then she gonna lower through heels and her legs so therefore her back stays flat so a lot of times it you couldn your abs aren aren knees that way it takes off a lot of the pressure and you can perform the exercise properly this can also be done if you the other thing - so I Miranda just sit up before you any ab exercises you want to focus first on vacuuming and the core okay so this is my next tip before you exercises you can just feel your stomach engage and suck in it you when you at work when you television but it here button you mostly as possible so that visual so before you do any core exercise you want to pull in vacuum in the ABS and then begin the exercise this ensures that you hit your transverse and your rectus abdominus at the same time and you most bang for your buck out of your core exercises the next one is I you an exercise on the mat so Miranda lay on the back and this one is crunches we see crunches a lot and I don they your core I think there ones but this is also an area where people are using their hip flexors way too much so I your hands over your head and then let do a full crunch okay so you see how she sits up this is the proper way okay so let show maybe what that would look like with hip flexors and up okay so now she hunching forward and you your hip flexors a lot more then if you elongate your core and focus on pulling the ABS in okay so let way one more time okay it you being used and then the proper way one one rep on the proper posture up so you see how she comes all the way up and extends once again she before she even started that exercise and now she other thing is making sure you going to high rep or too high in volume when you you do them properly you don do that many if you contracting if you vacuum at the beginning and if you maybe adding weight cuz you an advanced exerciser you don go 250 you don it in but if you effective way shorten your volume shorten your reps and focus on contractions and form first and guaranteed you better workout thanks Miranda leave us a comment below thumbs up if you guys have any other tips any other questions about if you or ways to do an exercise better let us know we want to know more about what you guys want to hear thanks for joining us I Amy Jo we	Success
5 Best Leg Exercises for Knee Pain (SOLUTION FOR BAD KNEES!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOrNjLZfUrU	ATHLEAN - X	Hey ladies any of you experiencing any kind of leg pain and you sure what kind of leg exercises to do let me show you five of the best leg exercises you can do for knee pain hey guys so exercise should never cause pain or make it worse so remember any kind of muscle soreness after a hard workout you know that totally okay that you shooting pain or sudden pains and your muscles your joints that is kind of telling you to stop and maybe check with your doctor okay also you want to make sure that you five or ten minutes before you do any of the exercises that way you make sure that your ligaments and tendons and everything is primed and ready to go when you do your exercises okay first thing we start with the glute bridge what I love about this one is it glute activating exercises and that really the key is trying to make sure things are activated before you actually work them okay so you can either do this flat on the ground you can do it slightly elevated which I find it gives a little bit more just gives a little bit more range of motion but you don have to do it that way okay so this is great it and our hamstrings it also helps strengthen your core it a great exercise so what you is you ground back this flat hands are on the ground I tops of my heels on the Box what I gonna think about doing is just relaxing my neck I just gonna push my hips up towards the ceiling so I you glutes together but my hamstrings are totally firing too right now so that what like I mentioned earlier super great for kind of activating everything and that a posterior muscle group back there and lower raise really squeeze we trying to kind of keep everything on an even line here really pressing the hips up and lower you can do anywhere from a 5 to 10 second hold and lower so maybe think about doing 12 maybe 12 reps 3 rounds of that ok so now we into that good old wall set great isometric holding exercise super good for quads hamstrings let abductors inner thighs so what we gonna do with this is you stand next to the wall our feet are going to be about shoulder-width apart you slightly and what you you get as close as you can if you feeling too much pressure you can bring your feet out even more and you gonna slide down and try to hold for anywhere from 20 to 30 seconds the goal for this would to build up to 60 seconds a lot of times if I pressure in my knees if I lift slightly lift my toes I find that puts more pressure through the backs of my heels and doesn knees so I done with that you up completely come out of it let everything recover for a short time maybe 15 20 seconds go back down try to do 2 or 3 reps so once again isometric exercises you may think well what sitting there just holding there amazing you can build so much strength with ice I can are to keep into your leg workout once again another really gentle lake exercise standing hip abduction so with this one you can do with or without a band a band is just going to add a little bit more resistance this is really going to hit the abductors the outer thighs so when you so it what another really good thing is it to hit those gluteus minimus muscles that are on the side here which can be really hard to target so with this you just want to stand up straight you don want to lean forward you want to just make sure that your head and chest er up and it even trying to kick up super high just use your the highest range of motion that you can so maybe 12 to 15 you can use a band if you don issues that we require maybe not using any kind of pressure on the sides of your knee you can use a super light band or a little heavier band this one has a you know like a mod pretty mild resistance but it just makes it target my abductor is a little bit more just a little bit more but nothing threw my knees I pain at all whatsoever 12 to 15 once I done I side I really feel that everywhere those are great so a lot of times you gonna have to be doing these deep lunges and heavy squats to get a good exercise resistance is really what you for okay next we low box up and over what I love about this one is it kind of limits your range of motion so with a lot of knee problems a lot of times the doctor may say ooh don super deep range of motion and I can even lower this you can even do a much lower box than this so with this one you the top of the box or whatever you have to stand on the goal with this one is to step it off and just do a slight vent it doesn angle we just a little bit of a push up back onto the box now when we into this one you can actually go back a little bit lower because it dragging any force through the front of the name when you step back so when I back here I can go a little bit lower because like I said I force through that knee and I up so just slight Bend on the forward a little bit deeper on the back if the front is bothering you you that just that doesn but I okay you can just modify and do the back lunge because we hitting our hamstrings our glutes everything workout with this so once you finish your 12 to 15 just hit the other side keeping my head and shoulders up my abs are nice and tight and engaged and if you want it to once again do the front go right into the back these are great for balance to a little bit of unilateral training is always good okay hyper reverse hyper so with this one this is basically a isolation for the glutes so you bath we have our hip line where the bent end of the bench is I my feet are going to be pointed and I just going to lift and lower I trying to do any kind of crazy laughs I and lower down and lower down you can really see that those glutes are really doing what they raise and lower so once again anywhere from 12 to 15 reps three rounds so with all of these exercises we all of the areas that you would want to work we fit the abductors the abductors our quads our hamstrings our glutes got a little bit of core in there and I my knees feel completely fine I feeling anything from any of these exercises if you do feel any pain like I mentioned earlier try to modify or maybe skip something that doesn comfortable to you just kind of listen to your body and do what you can do and progressively hopefully a lot of this will get easier as whatever issue

Easy High Protein Recipe | Turkey Muffins | BREAKFAST Â LUNCH - DINNER	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjIhNO6FP5c	ATHLEAN - X	hi everyone I athlean-x x4 women we are in my kitchen today I that I often use for myself and my family you ready let so why I like this recipe is because it actually great to prepare for about two to three days out I can slam them in the freezer they are ground turkey muffins so what I like to use is the ground turkey the 99% fat-free you can get like the 93 too and it taste better but I like to use get some of my fats from the egg that I add in here so I like to pick the leaner version so what I do is grab your bowl you put the ground turkey into the bowl here and one packet 16 ounces if I making for a couple days then I will use two packets and two pounds worth of ground turkey and I then what I do is use 1/2 cup of oats I put I have kind of the quick the quick ones I feel like they cook a little bit better when I I and then I the ground turkey with that then I put in and I like to use cage-free eggs I use two two whole eggs crack them throw them in and then I that together so I mix the two eggs the one pound and the half cup of oats and then I like to add in a little bit of soy sauce I will put in probably a couple tablespoons of spicy brown mustard and then also this is one of my favorite finds this is a Hickory barbecue sauce but it that flavor and it kind of balances out the really salty ingredients here without adding a lot of calories and no sugar so just a little bit of that helps and it keeps my kids wanting to eat it as well so if it were you know just my husband and I it would probably be more bland but we do have to feed children in this house and I just throw in some salt and pepper as well I mixed it all together and then I probably put maybe one pound would maybe make 12 muffins just depending on the size that you you know want to portion it out but if I if I use two pounds of the ground turkey then I put it in baked put it in the oven probably about even 15 20 minutes on 350 and voila you have your ground turkey muffins I will make sure to post the recipe to for you guys and there here the photo of it that is fantastic so hopefully you guys can use this recipe even tweak it and make it your own if you feel like it needs a little bit more soy sauce then you have a recipe to kind of go back from and increase or decrease if you don your foods so this is a quick easy way I add rice or potato to it for my kids and if I lean down I side of mine but that recipe that feeds the whole family and you can even take it with you for for leftovers for the next day for lunch so hopefully you guys enjoyed this video give me a thumbs up comment below let me know maybe how you recipe as well to make it your own thanks for joining me I see you guys next time bye bye	Success

10 Worst Weight Loss Mistakes Women Make (PART 1: NUTRITION MISTAKES!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U4YWim6cH0	ATHLEAN - X	Hey ladies today we talking about ten of the worst weight loss mistakes you can make we to talk about 5min the kitchen five in the gym here we go [Music] all right so let issues that maybe are working against you in the kitchen if you lose weight one of the big mistakes that women make is not getting enough protein we all hear it all the time especially if are in the gym working out really really hard and maybe you the protein to kind of support that workout or just in general it what having enough protein and your diet can really do so it can actually reduce your appetite it makes you feel fuller longer it increases your metabolic rate it protects you against muscle loss and you really want to think about trying to get point seven groups 0.75 grams per body pound of protein in your and actually each meal so really trying to think about with each meal starting at breakfast lunch and dinner gosh am i really kind of hitting that protein goal for each meal whether it kind of chicken or beef and eggs beans maybe your vegetarian really making sure you get enough protein if you or vegetarian or just within a protein drink if you you don getting enough protein many guys even meal size snacks we all know how crazy that is we get we breakfast or in between lunch and we kind of hungry but then we overeating sometimes we eating a meal in our meals so that another thing we careful of so for any kind of snack try to think about getting something with any kind of protein something that going to stay in your system let you throw some nuts on because you get some good oils but it gonna take a little bit longer to digest try to think about getting 150 to 175 calories with that snacky meal that you so that get a little crazy with your snacking because snap for a reason okay choosing low-fat or diet foods a lot of times with these foods they friend but they they salts and sugars and just a lot of preservatives and they diet food because we think of our head well gosh this says low-fat I can probably eat half the package and I be okay but really in the long run you add up with all of those processed ingredients inside there so just try to think about eating whole healthy foods and it and buy this stuff in big bowls you can cook it all in one day it to throw together and you feel a lot better you of get that sluggish you feel after you maybe eat a box of something that says diet or low-fat these are gonna process in your body a lot easier and it lot healthier you nutrients that you really needed a lot of those are void with the nutrients you critical piece when trying to lose weight you guys hate getting too little sleep so I know everybody you job all of these things and you your to-do list is just churning through your head all day and you you goes that checklist and there goes your sleep all of a sudden you know it hours into when you should have already been asleep but really trying to concentrate on getting enough sleep is gonna make a huge difference because during that time your body actually releases growth hormones they be a huge factor in losing weight so try to think about getting seven hours of sleep every night if you can I know it tough but it really makes a big difference when you weight okay the last thing having that unrealistic expectation I know it I know with all the things we see in the media and magazines and everything we kind of see all this stuff and we kind of think well gosh I one month to do this or two months for that and that easy on ourselves and think okay realistically like what can I really do you know maybe I need to think about well gosh maybe if I drop 10% of my weight and one year that for me so I think setting yourself up with realistic goals individually set for you is going to be really helpful maybe not based on what you the media or other people doing but just making it easy for you because then you goals okay you guys we the things in the kitchen let to the gym area or in the hub in the house if you have a home gym let about those things	Success
Weak Lower Abs? | TAKE THIS TEST | 9 Killer Lower Ab Exercises!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhKBbETilSQ	ATHLEAN - X	hey you guys I am Melissa for athlean-x X for women and today I you a workout that just targets your lower abs let all right here we go so back story I was inspired to do this workout because I was tested on how weak or strong my lower abs are and I found out that they have a bunch of exercises that we going to do in a workout but first you these are little sliders we be sliding our feet on them if you do not have these say you using paper plates if you surface but you don like this then grab some towels like some washcloths just fold them up put them under your feet and you to slide your feet before we begin the workout well show you what it is I want you to try the test that I did and you will actually see because I working on my lower abs you need something like this a chair a box something you can put your feet on so I gonna lean back on the ground let what I fist I gonna keep my hands right here and I want you to sit up as much as you can and touch your your elbow to your knees you should be able to go all the way up if your lower abs are very strong and sadly this is what I do that I can go and a lot of people said what you you work out all the time you should be strong no I don abs as much as I should so let again and no thrusting this is strictly pulling yourself up that so I want you guys to do this test and then you this workout let me show you what it is okay so you timer for 18 rounds 10 seconds of rest and 50 seconds of work it need your sliders and we are going to just target right here from the belly button ROM down first one is going to be heel tap I like this exercise at first you like oh this is easy and then toward the end of the round you kind of burning a little bit keep your legs at a 90 hands not not on your neck just keep them up here and I want you to suction your lower back into the ground and keep your shoulders off the ground and one at a time you gonna drop your heels keeping your lower abdomen flexed always keep remembering to keep your lower to keep your back suction to the grip that number one I quickly because we show you number two straight mountain climbers just straight mountain climbers fast as you can drive those knees up number three scissors we back and forth from our plank position to our back scissors I like these because you too much out of breath you really feel your abs getting tired which is what I want so just like the last exercise pull your lower back to the ground legs are gonna be straight shoulders off the ground and one at a time your legs are gonna drop scissor kicks keep that lower back I have to keep focusing on keeping my abs contracted and keeping my lower back on the ground number four this is where you need one of the exercises you need with your sliders I love this exercise I first couple times I did it they don your feet on these you the push-up position you both feet up at the same time and pull them up towards your hands as far as you can go and then put them back into starting position tough tough exercise now we we this is where you feet together again notice the pattern here we to the ground always keeping our shoulders off the ground keep your feet together and you up and down up and down focus on keeping that back to the ground as much as you can I don the way up and I don ground okay I want your shoulders off the ground and I just want you to just move your feet like 12 inches something like that just like this next step actually hurt next up cross body mountain climbers so what I want I say cross body cross knees I don sometimes I just say things like that and you get my point once I show you just like mountain climbers where you just pulling your knees forward now I want you to pull your knees forward but cross them underneath so a little more this way for 50 seconds now I love this exercise going back to your sliders again put both feet on them but we something different this time push-up position this is hard enough but what I want you to do is pull one knee in at a time don pull it up put it back pull it up put it back that is number seven now we an exercise that I the next exercise is going to be a rollup and this is going to be very tough I hate this exercise but it gotta be done the reason why I hate it is because it the focus it abs you above your head and you roll up like this and get up and touch your toes this is what I want you to do it per round and that want you to do is just focus on using your abs to pull yourself up I don want you to thrust okay that the job I want you to be here and just slowly get up just using your abs and roll forward when you go back down use control don control to get back to starting position these are not easy roll forward control on the way back that is your eighth exercise we one more we this time we touches so on your back again this is the pattern here lower back to the ground shoulders off the ground hands over your head you gonna have wide feet wide hands and you body opposite hand to toe and back down now this is more of the same kind of roll up but I the top I don yourself up just to get up there okay I know it that and touch your foot go back down this is your last exercise whoa let great job you guys if you are feeling it for the next couple of days in your lower abs then you did it right very proud of you I am Melissa for athlean-x X for women and I will see you guys next time bye	Success

my tips a full body workout safe effective for first trimester so let all right so first exercise I use a kettlebell kettlebells are awesome they are not that expensive they are space savers and you can use them at home and a lot of different exercises you can use them list so the first exercise I want to do is a combo alright this is gonna be more of like a plie squat okay good for building the hips range of motion and then we add a pole at the top so I ten of these really good for increasing hip strength glute strength leg strength for labor you gonna need that whew and a few more three upright row two and one okay second leg exercise we do a reverse lunge I kettlebell in this arm and then reverse lunge back and tap up at the front reverse lunge I reverse lunge seven six five four three two more two last one good you can also the balance I changes when you are pregnant you all of a sudden can so take your time on these and make sure to breathe if you need a second take a second to breathe and then jump back into the exercise three more two last one and one good those are two great exercises using a kettlebell I have a twenty five pound here but those are two great ones to utilize and man you can use do so many exercises with kettlebells even if you have a 25 35 45 is all you would need okay so the next one I going to come up okay so I up the angles on the legs side tap going again I make sure to breathe six that heart rate jumps up a lot faster than one you not prego five more so slowing things down taking breaks when you need it do it two more two last one one going even it out other side ten on this side ten nine eight seven six five keep breathing four keep those Airways open chest up three two more two last one good great job up and over okay we second we ball so after those first three exercises I would go a second round and probably a three round just depending upon your endurance your stamina you can extend to three or four rounds on that so that leg piece getting the heart rate up as you can tell I am and and then we can move into some upper body seated exercises okay so I have a set of tens right here set of dumbbells when I do a combo a bicep curl shoulder press I like using the stability ball and trust me the stability ball is actually awesome once you have baby you can baby so that for when you have baby okay so you use it now but you nine months or six months however far along you are now all the way up so bicep curls shoulder press I rotate and do an arrow press bicep curls I curl for make sure to be posture up sit up tall three curl press two last one curl and press is one awesome okay let just use one now so we target the shoulders a front raise okay posture up and you above the forehead and back down so we just coming off of your leg exercises it lets the heart rate come down a little bit being seated so combining exercises that are gonna be heart rate driven and then give you a little break it important to plan it good work out like that three more three two more squeezing the shoulders last one and one excellent okay then I so I will do a third exercise and then I would put it in a try set so I would go around probably do two or three sets of these three so this is the third one so I gonna do an underhand grip bent over row okay so bend over here and you pulling into the stomach big stretch down pull into the stomach squeeze pull the shoulder blades back roll your shoulders back and pinch nine eight seven six five four three two more two last one and one good there great back exercises that also you laying on your stomach laying on a bench or at a gym that maybe there that you sit on I found I can and I do both just pressing against everything and pressing against my stomach and I can this is a great replacement for that yes you good weight and you know the proper form you your back and you won anything lungs so you can I would do the bicep curl shoulder press the front raise and then go into the back exercise as well I performed that about two to three rounds like I said depending upon your stamina your endurance your level of fitness before you got pregnant this now would be

Best Leg Workout for Beginners (GENTLE YET EFFECTIVE!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhgH8nO_nV4	ATHLEAN - X	today we workout that is gentle yet effective [Music] okay ladies today I working with my beginning group and this is going to be a great gentle workout we areas of our legs today everything from our front to our thighs to our inner thighs outer thighs and our back side our glutes a little bit of little bit of calves too a lot of times we forget about those guys so the first thing we of work with getting our hips stability and a little glute activation we gonna do a sumo walk with AB and we just gonna place these around our ankles the key with these is you want a slight bend in your knee and you always want to keep your feet wider than your hips so when you do this you pulling with this leg I want you to think about pushing with the back leg so you that side to side so I leg here so you really are gonna feel this starting to engage the hip and the glutes just pushing off keeping always keeping attention to the band so just walk walk back and forth a couple of times you burn pretty fast so if you want to do maybe two to three passes in your living room or wherever you good it okay so next we into a wall ball squat so with this you just need a stability ball it can be big small whatever you have will work you just gonna place it against the wall I just gonna find like the back the small of my back and with these you just really want to think about letting the ball do the work so my feet are going to be about shoulder width apart maybe a little wider the whole exercise is also great for working on range of motion so what I keep my head in my chest up I have my core engaged I lower down I ball and then I range of motion is only here you know what absolutely fine we all have to have a starting point the more we work at it the more we do our stretching and the stronger we get the more flexibility we will have so just go down the goal would be 90 degrees if you can okay use that ball though I just leaning against him he partner in crime right now he helping you lower down and raise up so I want you to think about doing you know you can do anywhere from 8 to 12 and down so we and our hamstrings and our quads with this one all right it kind of warm up with my legs getting nice and warmed up you could do maybe two to three rounds of that let you down done with that we I have just a small box here for just a little bit of an elevation so what we gonna do with this one we front box lunch what I is for beginners it do is you abs are engaged you out for the box I just want you to drop down think about dropping the knee to the ground as far as you can and pressing up so like with a normal front lunge you all the way to the ground and pressing all the way up we distance we bit so we more gentle on the knees but you know we front of my front of my leg and my glute from the other side here and here so I just I with my foot keeping my head and chest up and I these you could do anywhere from eight to twelve however you feel comfortable two to three rounds if you want to work on this is another great one to work on balance you can come down and press up without touching the flit count I huge advocate for balance so if you gonna start a habit now if you starting to work out it develop down and stand okay so next we if you have a BOSU ball that half the ball that works too it because it this we we just did but now we laterally you gonna kick your backside out your legs need to go to about a 90 degree angle your knee is going to trap with your foot and we what we hitting the muscle in a little bit different way abductors a little bit more glute all of this here and back to start so once again 10 to 12 we making this explosive we popping or throwing our body off of it we to start working on balance the same as the other one you can go here and stop that helping you here by staying nice and tight and balanced it working your feet it kind of makes those little muscles in your feet work we strengthening those which is another good thing okay next for you to go to working our calves muscles so I have you do is just go to a wall you just going to put your hands on the wall your feet are going to be about shoulder width apart and you your hands up and down just for a little resistance so you your heels on the ground your body is nice and straight my spine is neutral straight my head is straight forward I just pressing up into the wall getting hot on the ball of my feet and then I love down I getting a full extension in my calves I down so the more you could have pressed into the wall the more resistance you going to get down in your calves so you really should start filling up pretty good burn pretty quickly so raise and lower so with these I would say anywhere from maybe twelve to fifteen and lower super good a lot of times we forget to work our cows okay the last we add in just a very slight plyometric I would consider maybe even putting a little bit of a mac down we want to make sure we we to me this is more conditioning and strengthening the feet okay so you can just start in a chair what we to do is we up we feet very lightly just a little bit of a pop so it this make it as explosive as you want don like I mentioned before for strengthening and kind of toning the muscles in our feet we really want to make sure that they because that the other exercises we these maybe to 12 to 15 it pop at the top get a little get our heart rate up a little bit I would say three rounds of

Can You Get Rid of Armpit Fat? | The TRUTH | Best Exercises for Underarm Flab!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6_fAFR-fSY	ATHLEAN - X	hi everyone amy-jo here and today you asking the question how to get rid of armpit fat yes we all know of that stubborn area right in the armpit that we about it huh [Music] so the armpit fat we all know we have to reduce body fat for areas and fat pockets that genetically we dealt with so how do we do that all right through nutrition through reducing our intake and our caloric intake by also burning fat with calorie or cardio high intensity cardio by making sure you that you have enough muscle mass on your body but sometimes it traits it were built and there that are a little more difficult for you than someone else to burn fat with so to lose that area we things but there are some exercises that can help you increase the muscle underneath and help tighten all right so let we can change and what is in our control right so I different exercises to do that other than the good old push-up as we all know I we know push-ups are a great chest exercise and those are excellent to add into a good chest workout what I want to talk about is hand position okay so hand position if you exercise niro okay if you here and you definitely going to hit a little bit more of tricep short front front delts and then also inner and check your major PEC muscles when we go a little bit wider you into the chest muscles that extend into the shoulder as well and into the shoulder girdle so going a little bit wider is Eataly a little trick that may help alright so you want to hook grab a barbell or you can even on on two dumbbells make your hands as wide as possible and do a chest press that way so I guys this one here okay using a barbell I and I feel the stretch right into the armpit and then you gonna come up and squeeze okay so this is just a little bit of a trick it really just hand placement it very specific all right and deliberate about where you and then squeezing right on the wide chest into the armpit okay so as I coming up I area into my armpit and squeezing making sure your shoulders or roll back and your shoulder blades are pinned together the entire time you don forward like this we retract backwards okay so I three two last one and one excellent all right so there exercise there then all I after I finish that set then I use my adjustable bench and I take it to an incline okay so I would normally do about four sets of that flat bench but here I superset so you don with one exercise you can superset in between the two I weight once again I hand position nice and wide okay and up and press now I coming up across my my pecs up above and then squeezing into the armpit and the top of the pecs every rep squeeze once again lift your chest up push your shoulder blades into the pad and you gonna really feel the chest working especially into the wide chest a lot more I five four three two last one and squeeze great alright so there exercises you can superset you could take that adjustable bench and go back flat again and then perform with the barbell and superset back and forth if I were you I would do four sets on both exercises and then also if you are performing a lot of push-ups it into your chest workout but my little tip there is like we talked about if you muscle mass into the wider chest place your hands wider on the push up if you go a little bit more narrow you going to necessarily target those those areas as hard as you could because of course a push-up is still engaging the entire PEC major minor but you want to increase that stretch it develop a stretch just like if a bicep going all the way down you make sure you building that lower part of the bicep because you completed the full stretch so that the push-up deeper down here and keeping your hands wide on the push-up is gonna focus and target that area as well all right so those are my few tips for talking about the armpit fat comment below let me know what you guys think let because I know a lot of you women are frustrated about some of these particular areas so let each other and encourage one another and let for joining me I for women we bye	Success

5 Next Level Exercises for Stronger Abs (SEE MORE AB DEFINITION!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i28UejPB6Wg	ATHLEAN - X	so let while but you get them a little bit stronger I to show you a couple of ways to do that [Music] today hey you guys so this really is for beginners who maybe have been doing abs for a while maybe you have a nice strong core stabilization system down meaning your deep core stabilizers you working on with doing a lot of planking um you work this is kind of the next step for people who are like H I feel like I been doing the same thing so I really sure how to kind of take it to the next level so what we is we progressively adding weighted exercises but also adding in tougher body weight exercises it all of that it in heavy weights all the time there lot of really tough body weight exercises that are really challenging and that can actually really um increase the strength of your core okay also adding a variety of exercises so the first I think are really really good for kind of accomplishing this goal at least I experience that okay the first one we going to talk about is a weighted tricycle I love this one because it really does Target the lower abs the Deep core stabilizers you start on the ground and all you to do is you leg is going to stay on the ground but we we do these alternating or one at a time however so that my goal is to make it make you a little bit stronger so this one we are going to think about just adding a little bit of weight this can be a 5 lb plate whatever you feel comfortable with this is 10 lb here so what I do is I normally just place it on my chest I hold it at the base so when I sit up it it stays in place I usually do one leg at a time because I just feel like I that uh tension on the one side so I sitting up and lowering back so this is just adding more resistance for my chest to have to pull my abs up to meet my knee so this is just once again I adding that little bit of resistance here so let side I 12 here just adding that little bit of resistance makes a huge difference I love those because we kind of starting at the bottom of the ABS first okay next we into a weighted plank trifecta this these are going to get a little bit tougher now these you can um actually start with no weight because they are tough but once again it of strengthening and taking things up a notch I lb weight once again you can start with three five however much we start in a side plank we to raise up once you get here you just going to do some kickouts so the goal here is to keep my hip raised even if you want to do just five or six then we this is where things are going to get a little bit tougher once you going to do a hip touch we really push up touch the mat bring the other hip up high as you can so even without weight this is challenging but adding a little bit of weight at the top is going to bring even more resistance so that goal with all of this just adding that slight progressive resistance to start strengthen strengthening those muscles that we already have kind of strong but we going to make them a little bit stronger okay next we Bulgarian up crunch so with this one we hold our dumbbell up and overhead we to we you you shoulders are going to be straight you rotation bringing your elbow to your opposite knee you back up and then you about rolling your abs back down rolling up rotate back to the ceiling back down so once I here on the other side rotate and down so we here because we feeling it here rolling up that slight rotation here and back up to back up to the top okay weighted PL plate pass another one of my favorites I love these um these to me almost feel like doing a plank because not only is it hitting the front of my abs it back which we all know the core is all encompassing here so what you you your back I would start with a pretty lightweight these look easy but they not I would also start with the weight closer to your knees if they here it your lower back I always make sure it positioned up a little bit higher definitely have your hands behind your head otherwise you whoop so hands behind the head you just going to think about flattening your legs out and bringing the weight back up so you this not only on the front but on the back that exercise it areas at once and back up so this one is one You definitely want to progress with a lighter weight but it always just adding weight here what happening we imbalanced after a while we set oursel up for injury because this guy maybe we he weighted or anything else that one really does kind of it little worker for both of those guys okay last weighted plank push so what you you don on a paper plate or a or a towel if you have a slick surface we plank and what I love about this is it it strong in a plank where we it on the phone um so that means you super strong we need to start adding something else to your plank to make it a little bit more challenging but you going to do is you this off to the side you down into your elbow plank you to grab this my back is flat my abs are tight and initially you can just start out with with less weight progressively you can add more and you can lift one leg okay so now we that not only in the front or the back but we movement so we that plank out of just a normal you know kind of isometric hold it movement but it going to be here again I about keeping my head in a neutral position if you want to raise that opposite leg [Music] so once again we lower back because once again we don always want to just load the front of our body we have to make sure we of loading the backs and the sides too it symmetrical okay you guys these are just some great exercises to kind of help you maybe to that next step of getting your abs A Little Bit Stronger think about Progressive using lighter weights if you started a 3 58 that it should be it and building that Foundation um so I hope this was helpful these are great exercises I really good

BeginnerÂs Guide To Getting Lean & Strong (BEST TIPS FOR WOMEN!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTnyqvfCt38	ATHLEAN - X	hi everyone I athlean-x X for women and today we going to talk about a beginner to how to get lean and strong let [Music] so I want to talk to you guys about the lifestyle of getting lean and strong first of all it rewarding but it and I think you want to start at the beginning by focusing on your health start to think about why you this and remind yourself that your health comes first and if you place that first that you know that you are trying to get in the best shape because it is you know for longevity and for your kids and for those reasons then it will never fail you but the aesthetic if that just becomes number one sometimes it can kind of trait take your emotional state over so just remind yourself your why and stay grounded in that so going on to some tips that can really help you along the way is number one take progress photos I really think that progress photos and getting exactly your phase one your starting point your measurements your body fat your weight have a journal even and write that in there but knowing exactly where you started from helps you and the weeks to come to look back upon that in different ways because if your weight hasn but your progress photos are showing progress then you know that things are moving and that you just need to keep your nose to the grindstone and keep going remember what they say is that the moment that you moment you so just keep going the other thing that I want to hit on is maybe some of you have read this but the same athletes eat and train they don athletes eat and train they don and exercise so when you remind yourself that you of wanting to be lean and strong that is defined as an athlete and so then you have to treat yourself like an athlete you perform like one you eat like one versus the opposite so moving into the nutrition piece first it you want to achieve the lean and strong results remind yourself that it percent nutrition it you day you might fall off the wagon and we all do we all have those bumps in the road pickups in the road where we fall off the bandwagon but how long do you let that lasts that long do you soak in that how long do you play the victim you get up the next morning and you get back on routine you meal prep you get back on to fueling your body with good wholesome foods enough protein and F carbs fruit and vegetables and you better again because you let that moment be very small and the big scheme of things so making sure that nutrition you know is is customized and also personalized for you and your goals if you that to hit a point where you be able to perform as hard anymore same thing with if you you training will be great but you might not be dropping the body fat that you want to get the lean part under control and training training really will get you a leaner physique eventually but the quicker way is when you put the two together you have the nutrition and the weight training on top of it so enter in and and that you that the progression is there so within that journal record also how much you lifting today day one was my squats that I did 10 pounds that measuring success in the gym in four weeks now I forth so I really think it to track and make sure at the beginning you point to look back on because that of the the biggest things I see is people that get discouraged and then they want to quit or they want to try a new way about it right I think most importantly is that you just keep going yes you make little manipulations but for the most part the program that you might need to be some certain tweaks along the way the other thing is to make sure that it or hope for it to happen like that because think about those people who have been in the game for years for decades right they that physique it not there so if you want to become lean and strong just realize that you be chipping away at it and some days you nine with your results other days you gonna be frustrated and irritated and why am I even doing this so just hold strong to your goal in the in the beginning and always reflect back on why you chose to you know become lean and strong and after that goal so I think the biggest things to remind yourself is progress pictures in the beginning and measurements get a journal and track your weight training track what you doing for exercise so you know how to manipulate that in the future nutrition make sure that you gram 0.8 to one gram per pound of gold body weight make sure that you are getting enough protein in for recovery for metabolism for hunger it also has the highest thermic effect in your body so when it digests protein it calories at a higher rate than a carbohydrate or a fat would so protein is really important to have in your diet and training works man weight training works hard training works increase your pace lift heavier there variables that you can change just to break through a plateau it just reducing your caloric intake and remind yourself it yourself it might be in phase one you might be in Phase two you might be into Phase three forever but remind yourself that you doing this once again like I talked about in the beginning and you this for your health if you let the Athletics always kick in as your reason that train and your reason for nutrition it won and and the same that I said is athletes eat and train they don exercise thanks for joining me I hope these tips are helpful enjoy your journey to getting lean and strong see you next time bye bye	Success
How To Do PISTOL SQUATS for Beginners | STEP BY STEP GUIDE | 7 Step Progression	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYUb69O7xj8	ATHLEAN - X	this is my step-by-step guide to teach you how to do pistol squats for beginners [Music] hey you guys a lot of people always ask how in the world do to a pistol squad I know they seem super tough but if you work at them and spend the time kind of doing this step-by-step guide you guys can get there but don there overnight or even in a couple of weeks these can take hmm sometimes months to build the strength flexibility all of that to be able to go right down into a full pistol squat so why don start from the beginning so pistol squats require a lot of mobility and warmup is critical so anytime you going to be doing any kind of pistol squad or even even just trying to get ready for this I recommend that you maybe done maybe a 10 or 15 minute warm-up really think about getting me especially the ankles warmed up that is really critical okay so many of us actually lack the proper ankle knee or hip ability to actually go all the way down into a pistol squat so because this is really going to force your body into a deep untrained range of motion that you poor mechanics is really going to be a critical piece to get rid of we want to improve that before you actually start going down into that super deep range of motion so it body gets acclimated so that take these tiny steps of kind of teaching the body how to do proper form so the first thing that I usually tell people is start with a chair and I actually had this kind of thick pillow here because a lot of times chairs can actually be kind of low so if you used to standing on one leg and lowering down that can seem like really far especially if you don of have that ankle mobility or the strength in your leg so add a cushion and what that to give you a few inches to work with to kind of begin the process so what you going to do is you in front of your chair you be as close to the back of the chair or actually at the front of the chair as possible you engaging your abs because there is some balance involved here and I just want you to think about hinging your hips back and lowering down gently onto the pillow and then you push through your heel and you stand straight up it makes a huge difference having this extra amount here because I especially if you it it can feel a little discombobulating so this is something you can work into your workouts and whether you or in the gym I would recommend maybe doing 10 or 15 on each leg a couple sets this is something you could need to do for a couple weeks or even longer if you really don mobility so once again you dropping down so let doing that for a while and you gosh this has actually gotten pretty easy I popping up I feel myself pushing through my heel I this I eventually you the pillow so Reena get rid of that guy so you have anymore so now we maybe about I don here so we we going to hinge it my hip I sit back and then I push through the backs of my heels as I come back up straight so now my range of motion has gotten a little bit deeper than it was before so now this is making me work a little bit harder I a little bit deeper range of motion that doing before because I was up a little bit higher with that pillow being here so once again 10 to 15 reps maybe anywhere from two to three rounds once again this could take a while for the beginners that that you may need to work on for you know it could be a month or two to really get that strength okay so once we while and you I built that that mobility there that strength that I really needed we gonna get rid of the chair so there our other step so the only thing now we assistant pistol squat in this these are great you can either use a TRX you can actually use bands anything to hold on that ropes whatever you may have so the first thing we assistance this will squat but I to bring a box in and the reason for the box is because a lot of times people don to get down into that super deep range of motion so what this is going to do this is going to allow you to begin to kind of feel what it feels like to start going down lower but it allow me to make me not have the flexibility to go all the way down so see how it drink when you have that because you hitting the floor you have to be able to have the flexibility to lift your foot up to clear the floor so what this is going to do this is going to let me kind of bypass that a little bit it let me cheat with my flexibility if you don help me continue to build that strength and the glutes the quads the hamstrings all the places that I need it and that ankle flexion so for a while I would say go maybe mid way down maybe to almost a 90 degree angle and stand I releasing and what you can use your arms for a lot of this it dropping down as you come up you can use your arms right now think about assisting yourself up with your arms so I it that deeper range of motion so much you you you that now we on the box because once again if you don leg up and clear it maybe you it full range of motion you your arms to help you up so once I get here I can use my arms to help pull me up but then it kind of press through the baptists of my legs through my heels through my quads through my glutes so this is another thing you while all right so let that for a while once again this could be weeks two months to feel more acclimated with that then now we going to go to the floor so now we just gonna grab whatever we have TRX or something we strong into the ground we a nice tight core this time I try to not think about using my arms as much that the next step is losing the use of my arms so now I way down and now I about really pushing with my legs I not concentrating on my arms pulling me up as much so I will read and then I pushing as you can see I concentrating on my legs doing the work now and all right so great way once again you that strength you flexion through your ankles you getting that hip strength you need so finally at the very end when you that where you feel like you lifting yourself up out of that squat without really using your arms maybe 10% of your arms are helping you up then it dumbbell so this is going to work as a counterweight so when you first start and you lower down you about bringing the weight out because otherwise if you don in your hand you backwards you you have to learn to be able to push and keep yourself balanced so this is a good really good way to start it holding the way out you lower down and you so this is really going to help me balance out this is great for beginners hold your weight out lower down into something nice a balanced pressing up through my heels and standing straight up [Music] and so there this but I guarantee if you follow all of these steps you take your time it once again this isn gonna learn in a week this could take a long time I mean it could take months and months to make sure they once again that you have that strength you have that mobility to really do all of this properly it mechanics and going into it with all of the all of everything in place before you really start just throwing them down without having all of that built in all right you guys I hope this was helpful I do love pistol squats they are great super great for toning and strengthening the back of your legs

Back Fat & Bra Bulge Workout (SECRET TO LOSING BACK FAT!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXKAz8Kv_3k	ATHLEAN - X	hey its trainer Susan with athlean-x x4 women if back FET is one of your biggest body hangups focusing on strengthening that area is key [Music] okay so today we exercises to really focus on that back area where the bra tends to hit back through here so what we work that root body really dynamically today I always think if you your body lower body dynamically you want to do the same for your upper body so we cardio some plyometrics because we want to make sure we because that can the area with muscles but we really want to think about burning body fats throughout our entire body and that what the first thing we today was we pull-ups I know these are scary a lot of women panic when it comes to pull-ups but if you can find a band that or actually you can do these on a smith machine on the ground these are so great for targeting all areas in the back so for the assistant I here because normally these are super high I have a resistive band this is going to give me about 25 pounds of resistance here so that up a little bit more I into it and this one just has a handle this way sometimes they here so you can do a front grip you could do a reverse grip whatever you can find it looks like that side here so I here today which I haven while so we want to pull up and lower down so with this we back area and just do as many as you can blow her down and rest but what about that is it specific area of your back this is probably the number one best exercise for targeting the back okay dude just as many as you can if you can do three hey that do three if you can do five or eight do that take a good rest period I want you to do all of those right after each other three sets that way you keep that intensity really get that muscle fiber to break down okay next we go back into a rollback state or push-up what I love about these is normally we a staggered push up we alternating stamps with our hands I just gonna put my hair under here roll back just good for abs this kind of starts getting the heart rate up a little bit I the way alright so you placement of my hands I and coming up and I hands before I jump my feet out and I pushing up bringing my feet back up going into my roll back up now my other hand is out front before I kick out lowering down nice straight body tight core back up feet should be facing forward when you come up and back who so what it does is it just challenges your body in a little bit different way I mean if we here if we do something a little bit differently it whoa so it backs of the shoulders leaving a different angle all right med ball toss to play so next we med ball all right however heavy you want to go because when you like you you still working your back once again we kind of getting the body getting a little cardio in we ball up in the air we they catch and here so let good speed going this once again it about losing body fat while we the upper body and stop okay last but not least jump rope okay what jump rope you think we feel like my shoulders well let you are but you connected so you your back too and it cardio so if these set a goal of maybe 50 or 100 jumps once you take you have 20 or 50 such a break go into your second step nice job when I just picking on the tips all right three rounds of that so we focused on our back hitting all areas of the back we resistive we all of this along with our diet getting in the gym making sure we that getting that that back fat I know it really troublesome especially when you have garments that are kind of digging in and it just kind of amplifies the area I know it can be a tough thing to do all right so we know if we want to do resistive exercises get some cardio in there make sure our diets doing good that plyometrics all of that in a good combination of being consistent thanks for joining me today hey you guys check out a clean xx for women comm great stuff over on that and thanks for following and we guys soon	Success
7 Best Fitness Hacks for Busy Moms (OR ANY BUSY WOMAN!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DxbafRQX5g	ATHLEAN - X	hi guys trainer amy-jo here today we gonna do a little sit-down chat about my best tips for busy moms if you to get into fitness if you fitness and you more time be more organized get more fit but trying to juggle a family right here I about it let [Music] these are just my my fitness tips things that have worked well for me so take it or leave it but I think it to just share amongst other moms so even creating this video was really important to me because I knew that other women would comment on it and also share theirs and I guys do as well we can always have room for improvement right so here few of the things that I do you know to stay organized within my family not only schedules but food and you know how do I simplify shopping grocery shopping also how do I fit in my workouts how do I consistently get those in so one of the things that I do is make a workout schedule for myself so I think it really important to just schedule that time in and obviously there days where you got to go pick up your sick kid at school or you know you have something else that comes up work runs late your boss needs more something out of you it but when you schedule it in then you able to really hold yourself accountable and schedule and rest days as well so if you feel like this day you know I to get my kid to soccer practice or basketball practice I have to work all day I usually on a Friday then schedule a rest day and just don pressure on yourself to get something in that day or it just becomes a day that like okay I right away in the morning and that and and then you plan ahead and schedule in your rest day that also can help also I enjoy having a gym that has a daycare that really helpful for me to rely on that and to not know that I can go at any time or when the daycare is open and utilize that so something like that really nice to even just have in your back pocket I do workout at home a lot but the more options that I have I found that I there didn happening at all that has become a little bit more reliant when I when I have a few different options also having home equipment like I was just discussing I work out at home a lot and it helpful for me to know that I can wake up in the morning and my house is quiet I can get some coffee and me some some water and take off and do you know a treadmill workout and then pull out my mat my kettlebells my workout and get a lot done there so I would encourage you guys to invest in some home equipment you know treadmill or kettlebells even a spin bike things like that are space savers and they you would think especially how much time it our videos utilize the athlean-x Tech for women videos a lot to see at home ideas and to get creative we have tons of them out there for you so utilize them and put it on your schedule also I think what would help is if you reminded yourself that if you are limited on time that weight training should come first I think that give women is sometimes they feel like they don workout it great workout in in 20 to 30 minutes you burning fat you so if you only have about 20 to 30 minutes focus on the weights first focus on on that as well because of what it does to your hormones not only just increases muscle mass but it that your body responds to a force being in you being lifted and pressing against a force pressing against a weight there just creates endorphins and helps increase the fat burning the fat burning hormones so always just think if you have limited time put the whip training first how do I organize my family I think that one of the ways that I do that is I make sure that I wake up earlier than everyone else that probably something that well for me is we all go to bed at the same time at night but I make sure to get up a little bit earlier than my family so I can get lunches made I can create my mental checklist for the day who who when who has lunch today that needs to be made I can make my own lunch and my husband even think about and scheduling for dinner as well what on the dinner list so sometimes you have to go day by day you know this idea of meal prepping on Sunday that that live in a perfect world and I think we put a lot of pressures on ourselves to be perfect that sometimes you lose track of just being flexible as well so I would I like to have that little time in the morning to to kind of do those things if things aren for the night or the day I think also a big thing is realizing that it it something that I hear a lot from friends or clients is I feel selfish when I take time for me alright it it taking care of yourself and if you want to be the best that you can be for your family for your employers for your friends you need to still take care of yourself it doesn to take 1 to 2 hours a day of working out but for you to schedule that in and for you to take time for yourself it really it selfish so I would focus you focus your focus and you know maybe translating that if that think that helps your outlook on how much you to find a workout so I think we we also find X excuses rather than finding solutions to you know putting your health first and then one of my other topics for my other tips is an insta pot I love in stewpot I cook with it all the time I got mine from Amazon I think they amazing literally chicken fish you can boil eggs and in like zero to crazy minutes it unbelievable it and it comes out really well so you can take a frozen chicken or a frozen steak and it insta so that of that home for for cooking things so there stay organized how I fit my workouts in and also a few things of how I cook in my in my kitchen and my favorite my favorite way to do that comment below I to be sharing tips with other moms so let start encouraging and giving other moms other ways to be creative be organized how do you fit your Fitness into your life and what do you do for nutrition what do you do for your kids nutrition how do you pack their lunches and how do you stay organized in the food department I you guys thanks for joining me today I

Are You Quad Dominant? Simple Test! (HOW TO FIX WEAK GLUTES!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U631IuCemI	ATHLEAN - X	hi guys I athlean-x X and today we about if your quad dominant and how to fix it okay so beam quad dominant is something that can really interfere with your glutes it could really interfere with your glute training and how your glutes improve where your mental mind connection is with your muscle mass and how you can dominant well when you do a leg exercise when you do a leg workout where you sore are you feeling it in your glutes are you feeling the contraction in your glutes and are you sore the next day and your glutes or is mainly your burning out in your legs and your sore in your quads and not your glutes even though you exercises that you have seen I am quad dominant I understand why I am quad dominant that created that it is I have really started to focus on the mind muscle connection and starting to engage my glutes with a warm up so the very first thing that I done now is to focus on a warm up and to get my glutes firing because that really what it is is that you firing those nerves into the glutes and then therefore you can contraction so it enough in the glutes so therefore your quads are always taking over there doing the lunge they your glutes are not so I really had to work hard over the few years when I realized that was kind of one of my weaknesses to increase the glutes by focusing on the mind muscle connection starting with a good warm-up and then I started to realize man my glutes are growing I was sore in my glutes and I started to change the way my leg workouts went it wasn all these different exercises it the crazy new brand-new twisted side lunge that is making your glutes grow it will help you perform the same old leg press squats walking just all those exercises that will help you perform that differently so if you don you your quads will just always overpower what your excuse me what your glutes are capable of so I like to start with a band I think that a good warm-up because it really starts with the intricate small muscle groups of the glutes and then I can move into the bigger exercises so I like to tie this around my knees you can place it around your ankles as well I think it more effective up here for me that is I found and so I like to place it around the upper upper part of my knee lower quads and I kickbacks okay so by pumping here I gonna warm up and it starts to just produce blood flow okay blood flow starts to fire the nerve endings into the glutes and then I two sides alright so same thing here it mental state focused on the area and it warm up any muscle group really you gonna have a better workout okay so I gonna kind of use this band to continuously probably for about three minutes do a solid warmup side to side squats so I I leave this around my knees the whole time so I minutes just really until I start feeling the burn mm-hmm the different angles I like to include that as well so now I hold on to something or press your knee against the bench okay side gluts here so I got about a minute left so I a whole three minutes okay and I so that the blood flow in there at the beginning because once you start hitting the bigger muscle groups with a more heavier weight and a more heavier exercise you I will it might go back to the kickbacks these pump it up you could even add in some wider variations on squats here so it really setting that mind-muscle connection right and then even bends so you get kickbacks in this angle here click back about ten seconds left okay kick back here great two and one good okay awesome so there you have it a great warmup and then what I walking lunges and I thrusts and then I legged deadlift all the exercises that maybe you you your quads are taking over so it a little while to that thing to remind yourself it be one exercise or one leg workout and you gonna feel it it takes time but if you really slow it down and you start to focus on it don say it took me probably a good I three months which is what one leg workout a week twelve leg workouts for me to actually really start feeling the development there and starting to feel and get sore on certain exercises so really try to focus on the mind muscle connection and then perform the exercises you know that you doing but starting with a warm-up maybe give this a try with a band three minute warm-up all the exercises that I was doing and let me know what you think see if that don realize you can fix it you can reverse that so it could eventually be one of your strengths but anything that you know you want to have advice on out there I mean I like to listen to people who they weren give them the perfect whatever I like to listen to people who they started off as that was their weakness and guess what now it people I really had valid value advice on because I know that they had to work hard to achieve that body part and it something that you know obviously is a weakness for me so improving that and building strength over time you can do it comment below let me know what you guys think let about it all right I thanks for joining me we by	Success

just go for five minutes just try get on the treadmill for five minutes or just start doing some push-ups and some days it stopped it three minutes some days I barely got through the first couple of reps but a lot of the time most of the time I ended up doing more I ended up feeling the endorphins and ended up leaving the workout actually feeling a lot better so one thing is you don necessarily think that it gonna make you feel more sick sometimes it make you feel a little bit better so there were days where I just didn think I had it at all and other days where it turned into actually a pretty pretty good workout so I have reduced my workouts down really in time and intensity I now are right around anywhere from 4045 minutes and it combination of things so I not able to lift as heavy as I was and I can things that I want to discuss with you guys and have you discussed back to me because if any of you are pregnant out there too and love to work out I to hear your tips as well so the biggest thing that I knew before I was gonna actually get a workout in was have like a snack in me so probably about an hour before hour and a half before even I would make sure that I had like a piece of fruit and a protein shake a string cheese a piece of toast or some peanut butter on it some storm some sort of combination of fat protein carbs and I have to do it kind of an hour and a half I feel like if I eat too close it all just right there so for me I like to have a smaller snack about hour and a half prior to my my session then also having something ready to go if you at home it right to your kitchen after your workout and have a you know a little meal prepared but if you you with you because you don blood sugar level is gonna drop quickly especially if it just be prepared so even having just like protein bars or a snack that you can just leave in your car it smart because I there beets several times where I thought maybe I had enough food and then I had a workout and then I was like oh my I better than always going through the McDonald know can happen too and that you don I would say have snacks in your car with you the other thing is water making sure that you get hydrated when you are pregnant and the first trimester it even keep stuff down so take little bits of water don little drinks of water throughout the day I me to get in in fluid so I some flavored waters honestly to get my water in I just don much really hard for me so finding a flavored water that has no calories has really been helpful and that will help keep you hydrated so that also realize too that as the months progress I think it take the pressure off your workouts and yourself from feeling like you need to be you know a certain way or feeling discouraged in your workout you to need to reduce your workouts the intensity the time as you go each month you will have to reduce a little bit of that but that that sacrifice is a wonderful reward at the end but know that you to reduce a little bit all depends on what you were doing before you started before you became pregnant so if you doing three days a week at a certain timeframe and a certain intensity that gonna have to reduce as you as you go along if you weren you know I would just encourage you to just even walk and just pick some active things that can get your heart rate up a little but not going to be so drastic the other thing is let heartrate right so they talk about not pushing your heart rate over 150 while you heard other doctors and read this material as well as you don heart rate to really extend beyond 145 150 it might for a very short temporary period of time but you want to control that if you want to get a heart rate monitor that feel like it you rates at that you feel like you can visually see a number I kind of just know I feel it and my heart rate and I feel it in my breathing then you just slow down so that another tip as well a few exercises that I can just feel the pressure when I do any core exercises the pressure on your back they talked about at week 20 you don want to really be doing any exercises lying on your back just for the fact of that large artery can press the fetus can press on the large artery in your back so and cut off blood supply so you want to make sure that you any exercises on your back I just cut them out now and not really focused on any core exercises I know a lot of the core that I getting when I doing other other exercises that aren directly to the core so I that um you know I can get the core strength back postpartum I of playing it safe and not really doing any core from here on out until I begin my recovery so that exercise and exercise a body part really that I think that know who you are and what you and how you feel but that where I thrusters so when you shoulders are on the bench and you doing you over your your stomach I feel completely uncomfortable doing that so I don about you or what you you know what you have done but a few ways to accommodate that as I still doing the hip thrusters but I doing them with a single leg here and then place you maybe a plate on one leg to add some resistance but to prep to push or to place a barbell over my stomach really a little difficult so I doing that one and also a lot of body weight exercises all of a sudden are difficult pull-ups dips some push-ups I mean like bodyweight you starting to increase blood flow and increase your blood volume and you gonna get heavier so a lot of the bodyweight exercises they just discouraging so I stopped doing a lot of those I and I felt like I of strength as well but you know I still trying to lift as much as as possible and looking about five days five days a week now so those are a few of the exercises that I really have noticed that I can them I felt like I can still perform them safely and effectively and I think it to be more of what you feel is comfortable for you to continue to do and as you go you confident comfortable in that if you guys have any exercises that you have questions on or you want to comment on share with me below I along and hear more from you guys and follow along here follow along on my social

3 Best Glutes Exercises Using a Smith Machine (COMPLETE BOOTY WORKOUT!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el10cgEpvwY	ATHLEAN - X	hey everybody it athlean-x X for women today we to be doing three glute exercises using the smith machine [Music] hey okay so we Smith machine today and what the Smith machine does is basically it horizontally which provides a lot of stability um more than free weights so it really is going to help you target the muscles that you want to work on um unfortunately this doesn of challenge your stabilizers so if you want to do that you want to make sure you exercises maybe dumbbell lunges dumbbell squats so I just periodically like to use a smith machine just because like I said you can really target that specific muscle okay I just have a small step here we deadlift I because I want to make sure that my back is safe especially my lower back um this actually has a lot of resistance that why I and for somebody newly doing this that what I would do I would actually check the resistance because he very summer super light this is actually got some pretty good pull to it okay feeder you I latching it if you machine before you with a nice straight body I slightly bend my knees and I think about kicking my back my butt back towards the wall as I lowering down I coming back up to start so I have a slight bend in my knees I pushing that butt to the wall cuz that the muscle I I and you actually get a really nice stretch here too but make sure you have that small Bend and really really kick that backside out so with these I would say maybe start with depending on how heavy you looking to really bulk that muscles so they looking to maybe just tone higher reps lighter weight okay now I kick my box back for these snacks after this next exercise both Bulgarian split squats you can use a higher box I lower box today but you can go pretty high to where your foots up here it just going to give you a deeper range of motion okay so what we we behind our head you foot back on the box you sure your foot in the fried is up there fairly far and the first one might like I said if you want to do it without weight to make sure you is correct that recommend you one you lowering that back knee to the ground so we and my shoulders are up I looking towards the ceiling because that really target that glute that we again I getting into a nice low deep range of motion the higher this legs gonna be probably the lower I could get so if you want to go with the really high box like I mention that into a deeper range of motion but even with this box here I could really feel that glute working alright I this out of the way the last exercise we alternating back lunge so with this one we want to make sure that our back knee almost touches the ground you actually going to get a nice stretch you really want to take a nice big step back on this one so we our shoulders I resting on my shoulders not my neck you can get pads for these too so my front foot is going to be out quite a ways again I lowering that back knee to the ground and a lot of times you can just either step here or here wherever you feel most comfortable I step back I back leg my hips are back and I stepping up and really making sure that my glute is doing the work not my quads because that and up and we alright so those are three exercises that I find really target the glute area which I really like and like I mentioned this is I you with your stabilizers so that I don smith are days if you want to go a little heavier and you want to really really target but maybe your balance isn super great this is probably the way to go so just periodically work it into your routine are you guys maybe 10 to 12 reps per exercise I would try to go at least 3 rounds once again make sure you test the resistance before you just start slapping weight hon because some of the bars already have a lot of resistance so just be careful thanks for joining me today hey check us out on social media check out our Facebook page check out our Instagram and check out athlean-x X for women if you guys soon	Success
19 Cheap Health Foods for Getting Strong (AND LOSING BODYFAT!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxBKMLmdMkE	ATHLEAN - X	today we foods for getting strong and losing body fat [Music] hey guys so I just my grocery shopping and I wanted to share some of the cheap eats and different foods that can help you get lean and strong but also eat healthy so when trying to stay on a budget and trying to buy healthy foods a lot of times buying in bulk is the way to go what just put stuff in the freezer and do things like that unfortunately our freezer is so packed today it option was Trader Joe place I love because they really have great prices and a lot of their products are really good so today was just kind of a Trader Joe bulk run so what we with them just gonna kind of briefly go through what I bought of course water that around if we want to stay hydrated it great for kind of flushing all those toxins out of our body so it good to keep water on hand you can usually find a great deal on these at different grocery stores so I usually try to keep a lot of these kind of stuffed away in the closet all right now I have in each bag okay tuna fish super inexpensive I usually buy albacore watch the sodium levels I usually get the no salt because you really don more sodium if you little bit of mayonnaise or something to it so you can buy these like this or once you can you if you or Sam they carry like huge monster ones but these are super great great for throwing want to sell it just throwing it to a sandwich really quickly another thing that I eat a lot of and that is great to keep around I buy just like this is just turkey meat and so just being on a budget the leaner is the more expensive they are but I find if I cook it I just drain off the fat anyway so if you buy something with a little bit more fat plus I like the taste it some really dry and it so that get something that maybe is a little bit more fabulous because it expensive and you just strain it out pretty easy all right put a little beans oh my gosh super inexpensive but holy cow these guys are packed with fiber packed with protein sometimes I will soak and cook these up and throw them on salads I mean it endless beans are such a great way to get your protein in and just tons of fiber can good old brown rice we all know about the brown rice and super inexpensive really easy to make you can either buy it something like this a lot of times I like to buy it in the frozen packages where I just pop it in the microwave for like three minutes and you just open it up and it carbohydrate to throw in with your meal good old effort sweet potatoes usually these you can find for pretty good deals Trader Joe like that they they like three of them wash them off wrap them in foil and cook them for maybe an hour do what you want mash them put cinnamon on them rather great pretty inexpensive super healthy meal good old pants Braves we meal prepping we so always keep some good old pan spray around so certain vegetables can get expensive just depending on the time of the year I usually just try to buy and maybe what some zucchini squash squash I wash up I just cut them up and throw in a pan just kind of season them sometimes I an onion super good super healthy really not that expensive they actually quite reasonable all right you know there is staple of most workout people little chicken breast these I buy endless little pieces what you can either when you meal prepping you can just throw all of them in a pan you week they do what you don up maybe you can don throw back in the freezer so super great super healthy price-wise they really affordable Greek yogurt here another great thing packed with protein they always have these on sale at the supermarket when I usually just watch the sugars but otherwise really good for just snacking and keeping around the house oats another great one super cheap mornings you can make oatmeal you can make protein pancakes out of these so many different things to do with your oats another great little staple in your diet chia seeds I actually just started eating these I love these I put these on oatmeal and stuff they omega-3 oils really good for lowering your cholesterol if you have any cluster all issues really good to keep around just kind of sprinkle on whatever adds a little texture to your peanut butter we gotta love our peanut butter I you can buy these in a jar this size at Costco but just a scoop of this here and there to get your fats in if you maybe not getting it up fat in your diet mr. peanut butter is was a good thing to eat around and of course milk I go through tons of milk I love milk I didn I love it for a protein it fats you can be a little bit more specific with the milks that you drink I like fair life they were out so I couldn ultra filter filtered milk frozen vegetables that go it could be a lot more budget-friendly because I know buying fresh or organic can get really expensive so I your Fraser apartment any time of the year usually even trying a good deal on frozen broccoli frozen asparagus anything and that only cook you can cook the portions you want the rest you just throw back in the freezer all right that takes us to frozen fruits which can get really expensive so if you try to buy these either off season or economic season they can really I it could be sometimes to buy blueberries and stuff so buying them frozen is a great option you can throw these in smoothies and like I said you can keep them in a freezer and you don worry about them going bad another one my favorite acorn squash I think this was like a dollar twenty nine this morning I take these I chop them in half I put in a little bit of butter a tiny bit of brown sugar we wrap them in foil cook them up oh my gosh I could literally if I was on a desert island he would go with me I could live on these her so good really good for you you packed with tons of vitamins antioxidants okay um jerky can be a little bit more expensive but it great snack you just really want to make sure that doesn want to watch the sodium levels but for a splurge every now and then I definitely like having some jerky around okay and last I love when I it easy on frying spinach and stuff just in these big containers a lot of times they the big container I handful throw it on my plate whatever I apple I tomatoes that are maybe looking a little weird in the refrigerator to use them up this is another great thing and just really adding a lot more of grains into your diet is really good because it just fast easy ok guys so here are some cheap eats that are healthy super easy to combined all of these you can make your chicken with your rice and your some potatoes or your so many different combinations up so it never going to get bored but they budget-friendly not summer looking for it all right you guys thanks for watching leave any questions you may have maybe an exercise video more nutrition questions and

5 PROVEN Exercises for SCULPTED LEGS (And Which Moves To Avoid!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98a7WHR1JjA	ATHLEAN - X	hey you guys its trainer Susan with athlean-x X for women these five leg exercises have been proven to have great results and there are a few out there that just don all right you guys let these different leg exercises let start with some of the effective ones we so what that when you your squat you muscle gains by adding the resistance because it everything hamstrings work harder than if you just were doing a bodyweight nothing wrong with bodyweight but if you grab those dumbbells so what you gonna do is we feet shoulder-width apart dumbbells just off to the side it super easy fix and you drop them to the ground as you keep your head and chest high you about a 90 degree angle kicking your backside out because we are targeting the glutes here and with this one depending on how heavy you go you can do eight to twelve reps three rounds great exercise you bit more resistance there alright now let effective all right mr. Smith machine there are some good aspects with this but the bad thing is this bar is attached it here what it does is it doesn challenge your stabilizers that is going to challenge your stabilizers this is not so when you getting ready to do your squats it pretty it doing that position to go into even though it may not feel natural maybe my hip doesn want to maybe you kind of rotate that that particular way this is really dictating to me what I doing so it learn a squat it takes away all of the balance aspect so many things there just other ways to work on doing a squat front squats are great you can just add a barbell do a front squat so hmm maybe not so effective next step ups effective love these so you can use however high of a box you want to use sometimes I use a much higher box other days I lower box challenge yourself use a little bit heavier weight so with this one you up on your box you back what I love about this is you can get a really nice deep range of motion which is critical and you press up through your heel so you want to think about going down but not popping up when you go down I want you to think about that front leg doing the work not the back leg pushing you up so I with my heel that about it so this is really gonna target glutes hamstrings all of that in the back okay so let lateral lunges love them so with these I usually will grab one weight this is going to work the gluteus maximus medius minimus abductors abductors you name it that it of motion we our chest we gonna kick that backside out head and chest up we up to start and down if you want to work on balance which is a huge factor I that don whole time nice little hit on the side of the legs really good for abductors okay not so effective leg extension all right we I have not sat in one of these for my gosh I don huge fan so what this does is yes it meant to target your hamstrings or I sorry your your quads so here you are that this machine or your quad dominant and maybe you and your glutes as much you some imbalances but the thing with this machine that I have any kind of meat issues at all this thing is just gonna amplify that and actually make your the issues even worse so there there that are safer that I think will target your quads just as much as this but not do the damage that I think this machine can do okay here we go another effective backward lunge with of our bell so with this you grab your barbell feet are gonna be a little wider than shoulder-width apart let me just turn here you to bring this up put it back on your shoulders not on your neck okay and this is a really effective exercise so now what we sure our abs are engaged our head and shoulders are up we big step backward and we maybe get that knee as close to the ground as possible we and we and uh so this is good for balance see this is what stabilizers if I was on the Smith machine doing this right now my state I wouldn at all so this is making my body work much differently than if I was doing this in the Smith machine whoo all right last but not least another really good effective one sumo squats okay this is gonna target inner thigh glutes so what we our feet slightly wider than shoulder width apart we about 45 degrees with our feet you can use weights or no weights and what we gonna do is we about a little bit of a pelvic tilt inward with this one that way it kind of activate the glutes a little bit more and we about a 90 degree angle with this one it nice and low to the ground and it works everything all right so these are the exercises that I find effective the other ones I probably stay away from those that I who deter you from maybe getting any injuries or once again maybe just not being able to work on balance or something because that machine does it kind of takes that aspect away there does don lot of exercises on that maybe just not the back squat okay guys thanks for joining me today have a great workout follow us on our social media sites and I	Success

correcting muscle imbalances [Music] you guys so have you ever looked in the mirror and thought oh my gosh that arm looks way bigger than that arm or you in the gym and you quarter this leg is so much

little your body basically trying to tell you something so simply put muscle imbalances occur when one muscle is stronger than its opposing muscle that cause like rounding of the shoulders so or bodybuilders refer to it as a a symmetry where you really want to attain symmetry or where all things are equal in size and strength so sometimes you can see these imbalances in the mirror other times you can maybe there maybe your hips are just a little off and so that gait there it you kind of start getting something a little off the entire kinetic change chain can just start going all over the place and get all wacky so it kind of identify early on what what is it looking right or what can I do to try to change that so a lot of times like I mentioned one a posting muscle may just be stronger than the other maybe our dominant arm is just way stronger so if you with the bar this guy is doing most of the work he hey I while you and like weak guy over here so then it trying trying to figure out well how do I change that what can I do so if we want to think about unilateral training so with when you do lose unilateral training or one arm or just at a time what it muscle recruitment so when I when I straight bar work everybody doing their work maybe one of us is doing more this is going to make that one arm that my left arm this is the dominant guy it okay I to really start you know kind of doing my part here so what we want to do is we want to what we want to do is we want to think about adding more reps I yes we want to add more reps and another set so if you say dumbbell curls you sets of twelve you weights away this guy is gonna hit stay around a little bit longer what we gonna do is we to him so anybody that weaker think about adding more volume more reps so what I gonna add another set of twelve to fifteen reps on just this arm alone he finished it three sets this guy is gonna start doing four so it adding reps after you arms okay well I you want to stop let him rest make him do another set it volume so that about unilateral training to sing with legs if you were let you let you together start doing one leg exercises it could be anything from you know a bent over it just you know anything to just kind of get this guy to work on his own not always doing everything together we got one leg squats just anything to kind of break that up the other thing is lift to your weakness so are you quad dominant so if you dominant you exercises you killer quads but then you turn to the back and your glutes are kind of weak and your hamstrings aren that you that need to ease back on doing my quad exercises I need to start focusing on doing a lot more for my hamstrings a lot more for my glutes so I the times too I like with core so if you let core and you plank all day I could just sit here I super strong but you rotate over and your hip drops and you gosh I strong here once I get here I can hips up so is that really I mean it doesn gonna be an imbalance happening so if you super strong here and here but when it comes to this if you of rotational movement you know there gonna be issues there especially if you kind of transverse movement everything is tied in so always try to think gosh you know am i doing am I always doing chest exercises and tons of push-ups and now I and so you and you look in the mirror and you just kind of feel like you yeah it posture it up to fail so what are we gonna do we gonna stretch out those tightened muscles because they do they get strong and tight and these guys get really weak so we need to change that where I doing back exercises whether unilaterally or together to strengthen my back I open I stretching anything holding bounds back here anything to get my chest to open up because I you also give you a better posture so a lot of these little things that are happening like with me I tell this arm smaller so it adding just that extra set for a couple weeks until he catches up or even months it could take that long we may help certain issues with with our hip system with me this hip tends to move forward what does that do it locks up my ankle so there can maybe seeing a time maybe a PT where they could give you different exercises to help open that hip up so our body is gonna compensate and it gonna try to take the path of least resistance I guarantee it so it create a new path and it throw your body in a total wack e-way so these are just some things to think about it happens in everybody everyone usually has one leg bigger or one dominant arm or one but it of noticing them getting to the root of it finding somebody who can either help you or if it size maybe not strength and balance those are maybe a little bit easier to kind of correct yourself but hopefully these were helpful to kind of get you thinking a little bit you know if maybe something you like okay that care of myself or wow this thing a little bit more maybe I need to talk to somebody because I creating more issues so all right you guys I hope this was helpful thanks for joining me today um hey follow us on our Facebook and Instagram we we post almost on a daily occurence workouts I hope you enjoy

things I have dumbbells and have a kettlebell it is you definitely need the dumbbells I have the kettlebell here because I like to hold that for one of the exercises totally up to you you can use your dumbbells and away we go first ten seconds is rest I know you can hear that that seconds seven seconds as soon as it buzzes we double knee tuck right one push-up double knee tuck push-up double knee tuck here the knee tuck is a little challenging jump your feet forward and back you can also do these from your knees push up forward and back or you can do the push-up from your knees and if you like doing the double knee tuck totally up to you let some people lay a like to lay down and get up like that and I say some people did I teach a class here and I watch how they modify things and I appreciate that it gives me more idea that version helps you to build up the strength to do a proper push up from your toes number two this is where I like to grab my kettlebell you can grab your dumbbells if you want it you you flat you are lined up I heel and drive an opposite knee up so from here drive try to keep your balance my weight or my rear-end excuse me it then I Drive up it weight just the touch because that far I want you to go down the drive pushing through your heel to get yourself up so we want to target your glutes and your hamstrings so your body is just going straight up and down drive that knee up at the top now we switch sides I like the kettlebell because I like this holding right here you can also hold here or you can hold your dumbbells so it so here we go you

how it you degree right here don keep them here one shoulder press to shoulder press come down for two curls and again shoulder press don can do hammer curls if you two you can also do wide hammer curls if you would like one two you can alternate between the three 15 seconds don one two and last exercise and then we gonna repeat these I love this one because it targets your lower abs so what you want to do keep your feet up suction your lower back to the ground you shouldn underneath or you shouldn slide anything underneath shoulders off the ground drop one heel at a time if you staying up the whole time then you should not feel this anywhere else other than your lower abs which is exactly where I make sure that that keep your legs at a 90 drop one heel at a time I call these heel taps if you feel your back starting to come off the ground focus I your shoulders on the ground you here stay up lower back drop that was one round let double knee tuck you one pushup get your chest

other side your heart rates going to go up these legs need a lot of oxygen other leg kneel down drive it up trying to keep it one smooth motion but I understand if you get off balance also what helps with balance is when you put that weight down and you kneel down drive it up but I like to hold the weight here ten seconds oh come on last liner next up here curls I love this exercise so grab those weights bring them up at a ninety one two two curls one to remember the alternatives for curls you can do hammer face if you want hammer curls and you can also do wide curls whatever you like let

Best Exercises To Get Beautiful Arms (TRICEPS | BICEPS | SHOULDERS!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydMgcyz8bIA	ATHLEAN - X	here arms [Music] so the key to achieving beautiful arms is lifting weights and using exercises that are going to grow and emphasize the different muscles of the arm so we gonna focus on today the front middle and rear delts the biceps and the triceps so we also want to make sure we workouts alongside with weight training so if using that combination with what gonna do it and it work with our muscle definition okay so here we go we have five different exercises the first we with is a lateral raise so you take your dumbbells however much weight you guys want to use and when you do this exercise I want you to think about going thumbs up this is going to hit the middle delt a lot of times people are going to do what pitcher and they bad for your rotator cuffs we don to do that it pointing down we want about what I think about thumbs up so we a good stance my feet are wide my knees are bent I I my thumbs up really focusing on that middle delt so depending on how heavy you go if you we going a little bit lighter you don want to go super heavy you can go a little bit more reps with that one and but try to do like three rounds of that okay next I still hold bicep curls alright I love this one because it works balance to one side of the one that going to be holding the dumbbell and an isometric hold for these I usually bend one leg because I love working my core when I balancing holding the dumbbell this side I bring them all the way down fully up all the way back down to my knee and up so I curl on the other side if this guy starts doing that self-correct every now and then when I kind of counting and focusing on my curl and I notice this guy starting to slouch I just try to bring it up to like a 90 degree angle so once again depending on how many how much weight you to hold you can do anywhere from 12 to 15 reps who are fewer once you pop over to the other side that side is going to be tired because he just finished so this is where it really gets fun so we contraction at the top lowering down full contraction take advantage of that negatives lowering down we don just let it slump down on its own think about that lower fully engaging at the top okay next we tricep extension right into a tricep push out we we bend over we your kick out he my body I kicking up to the ceiling once again depending on your weight maybe 12 to 15 reps once you guy gonna drop down you arm underneath yourself you your body if your legs are straight it gonna be a little bit easier my hand is gonna be in front of me and I push up and touch my shoulder to the ground but my tricep is doing all the work to make it tougher I bend my knees and now it more resistance it for me to push my body up that tricep is just on fire right now so with these maybe 10 to 12 once we finish obviously we the other side we other side rotate do that push-up three rounds of that the triceps is going to be no more keys okay next front raise whoo so different dough a lot of times you see people in gym just kind of doing a front raise which gonna be fine but the front delt we need to remember is pretty much right here so to really hit that muscle on a front raise you want to think about just a little bit of a cross in front of your face because that where we want a pin point so I gonna hold these here you do some raises by crossing in front of your face so you over a slight bend in the elbow so now we top you can even get it a little bit of a hold really hitting the front of that shoulder 12 to 15 reps okay next we going to go into a hammer curl overhead press hammer curl it different way of pinning the bicep it just hits the head a little bit differently we we straight to an overhead press down you the Front press and down so everything is full extension full range of motion my abs are engaged I my hips under to protect my back a little bit on that overhead press I not kind of letting my back freely here a lot of times you want to see that get a little bit of a hip tuck my abs are tight the whole time protecting that back and down 12 to 15 reps two or three rounds and last we gonna do is a band cable rear fly dealt okay so we going to get down into a kind of a squatted position my elbow is on my knee I me so I rear delt I over and up kind of holding at the top so we don keep it literally in a straight line in front of you once again you don eat a lot of weight for that little guy back there three sets of twelve to fifteen is just gonna burn it out okay whoo okay you guys we pretty much hit everything shoulders biceps triceps if you out just really burn it go to failure if you as many reps as you possibly can three rounds of everything incorporate that a little bit of a cardio routine with this and those arms are gonna pop in no time thanks for joining me today you guys hey follow us on Instagram Facebook we post great

5 Worst Glutes Workout Mistakes Women Make (AND WHAT TO DO INSTEAD!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyGYH57ECtU	ATHLEAN - X	hi everyone I athlean-x X for women and today I want to give you some effective tools tips and exercises for the worst ones for the glutes so a few of them are some tips that I want to give you and a few of them are exercises to avoid [Music] oh right so the very first one I want to talk about our step ups they are great for four legs they doing them properly so step ups are an exercise that you bench and your one foot is up and you standing up and everyone thinks they a great glute exercise so when you stepping up the one problem that I have is this back toe right here usually we hop up off of that back toe that main problem right there so yes it working the leg and it is it working the glute if you this is a good exercise but you might want to focus way more on pressing through this heel and not as much on the toe so the higher the step yes that going to target the glutes more but then you that toe a little harder to step up so when we rebound slowly here and focus more on coming back up again on that heel so just take it a little slower if you gonna continue to do step ups if your not feeling them the way you should then forgo them and move on there other great glute exercises that you can focus on so that that I want to talk to you about is hitting different angles with the glute so not only do we want to involve squats and deadlifts and hip thrusts you hitting a certain plane of motion you focusing on a certain plane all the time the mistake is is that we changing directions so you want to make sure that you differently because there glute muscles that create the entire butt so we want to hit all of them not just one of them and that doing when you and and deadlifts and squats you moving in one motion that so focusing on other things like this side movements side to side squat or the curtsy lunge where you different changing different directions is really important or when you seated and you machine exercise the machine great one because it different range of motion than you would with a squat or a lunge and and so forth all right moving on to my other tip is when you tip when you you build the glute muscle the glute are sleeping giant so to speak so we want to make sure that you with a full force if you go too light you on the glute muscle to actually grow and be torn down to grow new muscle fibers and bigger muscle fibers so focus on going heavy enough my next tip is lunges walking lunges are one of those as well that where your quads kick in and I have more dominant quads as well so I understand that I have to be very aware of having that mind-muscle connection for an exercise so when you walking lunge right here our leg likes to kick in and perform that exercise vs. so much on the glue so a lot of individuals are just doing it not as proper as you should so if you feel like it next day after doing walking lunges your glutes are sore then that probably means you great mind muscle connection with a glute if not avoid the exercise forgo it and move on to other ones such as the hip thrust deadlifts single leg exercises which are great single leg squats and and so on and my last tip is anything that hurts if you knee is hurting your hips are hurting you effectively as you should it gonna promote more injury and it slow you down from progress so my last tip is to remember that you don to do anything that is hurting you so avoid those stick with exercises that are that are safe for you and effective all right so hopefully these tips certain exercises are definitely letting you know the best way the most effective way to target the glutes and the worst way leave me a thumbs up comment below of some other exercises that you think just aren effective thanks for joining me I Jo we	Success

My Arms Routine (AJÂS EXACT BICEPS AND TRICEPS WORKOUT!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MMXCROGBDY	ATHLEAN - X	hi everyone I athlean-x X for women and today we gonna do an actual amy-jo arm workout biceps and triceps done the AJ way ready [Music] all right so to explain to you how I break down my biceps and triceps from a week to week basis I like to focus heavy one week I go heavy with my arms so I think eight to ten reps hitting biceps hitting triceps a similar way just with more weight on them trying to go to failure then two weeks after I do lighter weight so I in there and not do as many exercises and keep it a little more higher rep pulsing faster range of motion incorporating combination exercises for the next two weeks and then I go back to a heavy so literally when you think about a whole month I heavies and to light higher rep arm workouts so and my goal is not necessarily to build it maintaining the strength and maintaining the size for me so that intermix heavy weeps and then lighter fast-paced higher rep more volume workouts for my biceps and triceps but I do have just a day where I do biceps and triceps I chess let I found that it and triceps only so I just focus on those so let workout I I have twenty fives here I really like to do seated because it isolates the muscle fibers and the biceps better if I little bit more so I concentrated dumbbell curls my palms are up and I so once I hit nine I should be feeling about almost reaching failure knowing now this is just my first set good so once I do that then I roll right into a tricep I don ever I want to keep my heart rate up and knock it out I want to be done I efficient so both weights come together I typically will use the same weight or a little heavier so these are twenty fives I probably would go up about five for my triceps so that I and I in and I stretch at the bottom flex at the top and I slow controlled motion this is my heavy day I do this about twice a month two more slow and controlled one more all right and then my next one I will do a single arm more of a concentrated curl inside so this is just a focus on one arm at a time so I for my buck squeezing up at the top really making sure I come all the way down because it you right here you bicep good [Music] we more switch so you target and improve both harms when you focus on just one at a time on the other side just make sure you extend fully all the way down all the way up and sometimes I on the floor if I need to drop weight just to make sure my form stays right so if it gets a little too heavy and I losing the form I drop the weight and finish out my set oh so there try and another buy and then I go into another tricep so this one is my overhead extensions let so I like to use just one dumbbell some people like to use two I with just using one and I up to maybe a 35 or 40 pound over the head once again I like to be seated for a lot of these exercises because if I standing I feel like my body likes to cheat so I like to prevent that by staying seated so this one here slow and controlled I possible and contract all the way up so it I [Music] big stretch and then explode at the top whoo all right so there exercises for the heavy lift now I gonna show you my higher rep day so those are the ones that I around eight to ten on those I heavy day those will be my sets that are at run eight to ten reps I do anywhere from five to six rounds of all of that an increasing weight making them heavier as my sets go on or five and six are my heaviest and my hardest set so once I next week the next time that I come back to do just an arm day I higher faster higher volume pace for the arms so this one I like to start with a resistant band gets the blood flowing gets me thinking about biceps quick dynamic I put both feats in I like to use like a black one usually black on bands means it I this is just to get blood going like I said this is more of my higher rep I won ten seven four three two one and then I like to use the bench on so I can get a good stretch elbows are in so these are narrow push-ups focusing on the triceps elbows in and pump you can keep it really narrow if you want in here which works great too I just feel like more comfortable for my shoulder joint for me they go out a little bit wider so I about 15 focusing on the tries so high rep there then I have two exercises left so the next one I as a barbell and this one I just go a little bit lighter on the weight so I can probably get about 20 reps for this one so I start wide in a wide position and I it narrow and go 20 so this is really to burn them out the high reps really gives me good focus so it hitting a different part of my bicep 19 20 and then I take it narrow so I shift my hands in hey hit more of the inner head of the bicep and curl it out and this is really to burn them out big-time ten more four three two more last one ooh and then I like to finish the triceps off with skull crushers and these ones I use the bench as well and I these on the floor you crush up over the head so stretching over and then an arrow press so this is a combination exercise kind of getting two in one and I like to do higher reps on these so I do about 15 to burn them out it with arms six more five press four press three and two last one extend and press whoo there you have it so you have AJ focus on lower reps higher weights more focused slow controlled movements and then the next two weeks I focus on higher rep not as many sets but more reps quick dynamic exercises so that what I found it really works for me and my goals maybe your goals are different maybe you want to build a little bit more so maybe you want to do more of my heavy workouts all the time if you want to lean down and maybe you want to necessarily have more muscle mass in the biceps and triceps then keeping them tight and toned try my strategy so I trainer amy joe-- thanks for joining me today check out a fleam XX for women their

How To Meal Prep | Complete Beginner's Guide	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i22rMf1LE4c	ATHLEAN - X	hi guys I athlean-x x4 women and today we talk about meal prep it but I let [Music] okay so the very first step that I going to tell you about meal prep is you have to pick the time and the day put it on your calendar to announce it write it down Sunday 1:00 p.m. I am meal prepping so you kind of have to set yourself up for success and scheduling the time out at the beginning so this is the time I going to devote to prepping my meals whether it for the whole week or I cook in bulk that need to set aside so schedule that and make it a priority then if you have that end you know you need to get to the store beforehand to you know prep those meals you the items so what I like to do is after I go to the store and I kind of think okay this is what I want to have on my menu for the week I want to use chicken I want to use steak I want to use the turkey fish shrimp whatever it is I make sure that I have enough utensils so throughout the years I have accumulated a lot of cups a lot of half cups a lot of different scales this is probably my sixth scale that I have gone through in my my time one of the very first things that I did was run this under water with my very first scale and I guess that proves on the blonde but it has batteries in it and it totally died on me so I had to bury my scale number one so this is scale number six I got it from Amazon it was literally ten dollars and it the best one yet it so I don plug but I just did so this has been been with me almost a year now that record so I like to have a very good scale and measure green spoons you cannot go without measuring spoons if you something how can you measure your success if you you really important to say okay I have a tablespoon of almond butter it leveled off not a heaping that tablespoon that a half so you know measurements are important it you have enough measuring devices and your scale these are super convenient they are reusable bpa-free microwave safe I got these from Amazon as well these are awesome I them and I like to literally just lay out you know I six going on I husband who I am so you know I and you know my kids foods I kind of add in here and there with what we start with so one of the the things too I like to use with in meal prep are convenient things that you could just grab and go so yes for lunch right basically breakfast and lunch every day I prepping but everything else in between are like my little two packs of hard-boiled eggs so this is like a snack and then like I it that required no prep for me so it really keeps it simple when you can have a few meals in a day that are like that it and some almonds it it you don grab-and-go item some people need all of their meals like that and that a doctor or someone who is just on the phone all the time or you just are so busy you can down to eat a meal then your meal prep is pretty simple so I like to use these as one of my snacks I also keep one almond butter I actually keep this at my studio in my office so I keep it in the fridge and it lessening that I have to remind myself to bring every day and I know I have a tablespoon of this either I put it in Greek yogurt or I put it on a rice cake but that have to think about so if you can really minimize how much food prep that you have to do by already having it at your work having it in your drawers having the big bag of almonds in your drawers if you every day just leave it there then you don your meal prep then it then it minimizes all of the distractions so that I like to first kind of get that out of the way then think about what am i how am i preparing how am i preparing actually the meals that I down and take time to enjoy so I like to use a lot of ground turkey I feel like that is probably the the easiest most convenient and that tastes good that we can make taste good by adding seasonings and flavors to it so I like to just skill it put in a big skillet probably three to four packets of ground turkey cook it all and then this is the the famous community family whatever you want to call it a picnic box here we will put meats in here so this is we have about like five different ones of these as well but we will literally just pile in whatever that meat is for the week and then will you know take it and measure it and this is even for dinner as well we will measure it out and then you know you already have your meat prepared because meat takes the longest so meat I would consider cooking a lot of it for the week carbohydrates and vegetables number one they taste better when they it takes longer to prepare so yeah so I would recommend you know using that and that really helps on dinners when you come home you your dinner already prepared and made but lunch is going back to the lunches I will definitely just divvy out so it just okay here broccoli here turkey and 4 ounces of sweet potato and then that one same thing here one two three and then same thing that one do about three to four days for lunches and then what I like to do is maybe that last day is use a protein bar or something a little bit more easy usually on Friday just for the fact that the food it fresh the other option that I have used before is put in the freezer so you can do that as well and then grab it out Thursday night and set it in the fridge for Friday the other thing that is big huge buy a large box of Ziploc baggies that has really helped because I making lunches for my kids too this one you can never go wrong so you know worst-case scenario you these are dirty too you throw your you throw your asparagus you throw your broccoli you throw your ground turkey and and a bag and then you can bring even like a dish with you to heat it up with at work so invest in a few good items that are really gonna help you stay organized and develop a routine you have to develop a customized routine that works for you you know everyone has different obstacles that you the day but setting aside that time to prepare and meal prep is big and then you know as you go about your day you don thing to think about making sure that you have your meals prepared and your results are important because if you can take care of the ones that you love and that are around you so take care of your health meal prep is very important and

How To Get Rid of Bloating (10 FLAT STOMACH TIPS!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNkgz6gVBdw	ATHLEAN - X	hi everyone I athlean-x X for women and today we want to discuss how to get rid of bloating I have quite a few on the list here of ways to reduce bloating decrease bloating or essentially get get rid of it that start number one is making sure you drinking enough water I love to drink at least a gallon a day I didn start that way I was actually a worst water drinker in your life you seen and as I actually did notice that I was reducing the the bloating in my stomach because I was hydrated so my body wasn necessarily thinking I was dehydrated and holding onto water so make sure you works people so drink water number two fiber make sure you getting enough fiber in your diet vegetables and oatmeal and breads and if you need a fiber supplement that great way to you know add some more fiber to your diet but you can get quite a bit of fiber in good foods add more beans beans and quinoa or a great one to increase your fiber content just to making sure your regular so fiber content so that three is exercise are you getting enough exercise are you going you know twice a week when maybe you could be going multiple times four or five six seven days a week that could actually increase reduce sweat and so when you you system actually functions better so you get enough water you fiber you get enough exercise all three of those already guaranteed will reduce your bloating number four is no alcohol I think alcohol can really take it affects even a few days after you have a you drink it as you increase bloating and it takes a while to really extreme out of the body and you know to bounce back from that so it you don some ice water that moving on to number five maybe you not getting enough probiotic and you cannot get a probiotic in even like Greek yogurt and yogurts there also some supplements that are have probiotic in them so sometimes we need that in our gut for gut health so Greek yogurt is an excellent one that contains a lot of these probiotics but if you don can for a probiotic digestive enzyme in a supplement or maybe you much dairy so moving on to my next one is maybe you maybe your body doesn very well if you intolerant sometimes you can even just have a reaction to lactose so do some research on that maybe go get tested check it out after dr. on that one the next one is maybe you much wheat and gluten some foods have been known to bloat individuals that are getting too much wheat or gluten in their diet so that that happens in a lot of breads a lot of pastries a lot of you know things that are have more processed foods have more weight in gluten them so reduce that and maybe you instant results right away or remove it altogether the next one is stress if you have a stressful job stressful life this can alter your hormones which then in turn can increase bloating so trying to reduce stress as much as possible it it you another one I have two left sleep sleep is also another one probably coincides with those who have a lot of stress in their life obviously if you are a mom and you and you have a full-time job and you I mean boom they sleep already so some of those things maybe you can just say okay how can I get a little bit of better night how can I reduce my stress so and if it have you it under stress and no sleep and not getting enough sleep can produce them stress so it first the chicken or the egg well both of them are kind of a go together and then my very last one to reduce bloating is ask yourself how many sugar alcohols am I having everyday sugar alcohols can be found in protein bars they can be found in breads they can be found in a packets of oatmeal even you think that you something good for you but maybe you getting a little bit more sugar alcohols diet soda if you get a coffee every day are you getting a sugar free flavoring in there that has sugar alcohols in it gum chewing a lot of gum that has a lot of sugar alcohols in it so kind of just ask yourself and evaluate how much sugar alcohol are you getting in your day if you notice that bloating is a big problem for you so there is a large list there start checking them off and then if you literally have gone through all of those you know maybe you want to go to your doctor and talk to your doctor about the symptoms that you comment below any questions let us know below we going because I think this is a big one I think a lot of women and men experience the bloating and are out to find a solution so we you let us know maybe what has worked for you and keep us posted thanks for joining me I bye-bye	Success

How To Get a Smaller Waist ? (BUT KEEP YOUR CURVES!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfos8ywvaJk	ATHLEAN - X	how your curves [Music] and edie you how to get a smaller waist but keep your curves which can be a little tricky I know so when people think of curves they generally refer to the hourglass figure of like the chest and the hips and the butt and all these body parts but those are usually comprised of a lot of body fat so if someone just starts a new program they cardiovascular stuff all of a sudden it all my curves go yeah so with a proper cardiovascular training just don overdo it and strength training routine you can actually enhance those muscles that actually embrace our figure and stay healthy at the same time if we just kind of get the right combination of stuff so just here tips so number one eating healthy fats so healthy fats can be found in nuts lean fish olive oil and many other tasty foods and that really should be a part of your diet because if you keep those curves but lose some weight make sure you your diet number two don yourself so starting yourself can keep you from keeping those curves because if you not really eating and you do all these workouts your body to be kind of depleted you need the protein to build muscles and you need carbohydrates because your muscles need those to survive so do not starve yourself third do anabolic training what about anabolic training is you can actually isolate each muscle group individually and really focus on building that one specific area that what you a little bit more dominant you why don isolating doing something an aerobic training with that let into our exercises I have four of them today these are different exercises that are just gonna kind of help with our waist it waist cinch in a little bit we kind of toning those muscles and along with a good diet like I mentioned a good cardiovascular program nothing overkill though just because we do want to kind of keep our shape these are gonna help out okay the first thing we is called a t stabilizer you get on the ground you a plank position my core is stabilized my head and spine are neutral I gonna rotate my feet I feet in a staggered stance here for more stability and I the ceiling so this is a little bit a little bit about a little bit of a rotation we spine up because we are getting a little bit of a rotation through the spine but we throughout our entire core system here everything from the front to our obliques to the backside so we kind of rotating and folding so now for people if you want to make it a little bit tougher you can snap your feet eventually so now I really feeling it here to make it even tougher you can lift your leg here so there different ways you can make this a little bit tougher depending on your your abilities okay next we go into a knee tuck so if this one you position you want to think about rotating that hip as close to the ground as possible and we our leg out at the end so we start here abs are tight you just Center you about rotating dropping that hip down and kicking out drop it down kicking outside really feeling my obliques doing nominally most of the work here they helping these slowly lower down and kick straight back out of course when we done at that side maybe 10 to 15 reps we to then to that outside elbow out of stretch bend that elbow stretch out okay next we squat with punch so at this one you just gonna use a lightweight feet are going to be about shoulder width apart where you go into a deep squat we going to rotate and punch off to the side with this one you want to keep it slow and controlled but you want to get triple rotation and that through your ankles your knees and your hip so you to nap we we that triple rotation I it and at the top I really squeezing my stomach and then I gonna stop the rotation that old police are gonna come in here boom drop low so you kind of want a rotation and then you your with your obliques your sides that with these twelve to fifteen reps two to three rounds okay last one you can use super light weight on this we certainly don me this is a great way to work them this is a ball lateral flexion lateral flexion is something that take you from side to side it your spine this is about a six pound ball you can go with something much lighter put the beginner she gonna hold your arm out straight and we hand together so we strengthening a little bit on our sides here it another good position to work a lot of times we don positions so it side this hand is just helping me balance a little bit more I of kicking up trying to crunch a little bit without side so for the more advanced people you can actually do a toss over the head so you here together and you little pass back and forth so it a little bit more metabolic but it really working the sides here that building it toning that area of a little bit all right you guys so I hope these tips were helpful it is possible to work out to build certain areas that we want to build other ones maybe we want to take her down a little bit I can mention it a combination of diet the proper exercises and a little bit of cardiovascular work and that way you can kind of monitor how much

How To Set Fitness Goals (AND ACHIEVE THEM!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3im6CsyTyHg	ATHLEAN - X	hi everyone I athlean-x X for women and today we want to talk about how to set fitness goals and also how to meet them [Music] so studies fitness goals is really important because how do you know what you track them how do you know how to achieve them and I think having a proper structure to doing that is really important because also it keeps you motivated so having goals is number one important because it keeps you motivated and I think encouraging those who are after certain results if you don define those goals at the beginning you lose sight you know you lose track of what you wanted in the first place so and think about it there different goals out there that our health and fitness related so let about a few of those so first off you know the most obvious is athletics so what by that I mean of what you look like so reducing body fat reducing your weight and how do we track those so few different ways is by using a measuring tape one of the great ways that I encourage individuals to track your order even just to set a fitness goal is by saying okay use a measuring tape and measure your waist you know waists are different number one based off of genetics but I think it great way to identify if you achieving you know fat loss or not and that other way and you want to just find out how to read the error if you waste is coming down then measure right around the bellybutton belly button never changes areas and if you measure at my high waist well maybe maybe one week you measure a little higher up and the next week an inch lower and it can kind of mess up to be exact you want to compare apples to apples so I always encourage individuals to measure right around the belly button and then you can kind of see week to week progress and guaranteed you know you around the abdominal region so that great measuring device and a great way to determine if body-fat also closed closes another great one at the great goal to set I encourage those to set aside a pair of pants so those are my measuring pants those are the ones that I to every Friday I myself I Monday I Tuesday yes I on every Friday throw em on every Saturday and see how you feel that great way to you know this progress also taking pictures as well is a good one so progress pictures are pretty popular the whole selfie thing I throw up your your photo album and you it and you know really see the different muscle definition that you in your arm or your abs or your leg because those things are motivating maybe your abs aren where you want them to be yet but what about your leg you know look at the things that that have come a long way and be encouraged by by the progress there so I think that pictures and and a mirror in general is really important and a great way to track your aesthetic goal moving on there and I know some scales show body fat as well this is practice than the the scales that you especially the the home the home scale ones so you have to have someone it really difficult to pinch your self and get your own body fat but these run around two hundred dollars just depending upon you know what skin fold caliper that you get but the most roller excuse me the most reliable or right around two hundred dollars so that another great way to track progress and and see maybe where your where your body fat was gone as well all these variables are are just that they not one way is dictating results at all but you know if it and it you know focus probably the best way is on the mirror and your and your photos moving on to another you know fitness school how to set these fitness goals you know it about your inner being and focus on you know why do you want these fitness goals and you know what else is gonna help you become well-rounded so thinking about your nutrition thinking about your family that area that you this for yourself but maybe you and you to do it as well so then set goals for dinners how can you improve your dinners at night plan ahead right so maybe create a schedule that has Monday we having this Tuesday we Wednesday we great way to set goals for your family and focus it on nutrition and maybe you do it with the workouts as well a great way to set up the goals and and meet those goals is to write them out so you know a park workout or we were going on walks every Monday night we walks write them out so you can track them and then also you can look back and see you know what you that are setting sustainable goals and they specific the moving on to another one is self-image I think a lot of us women mom sisters we all recognize that in one another self-image is a pretty big topic and I think it can all work on and realize that my gosh you know as many women that are out there 9 out of 10 are unhappy with the way that they look and I think as long as it and not over taking your life not affecting how you treat people how people treat you how you wake up in the morning how you see life and conquer your day then I think it healthy you know motivator but at the same time setting softimage goals is important so making sure that you talking positively to yourself every day and realizing that you can have you can have both they don exclusive on you know that you upset with how you look so now you treating others in a way that you know it to day so set self-image goals as well I think that where you feel health and fitness is important to you and and write them out once again journaling is a big thing that I think is really effective whether it fitness goal and aesthetic goal is track it always track it and then you can go back and review on how your progress has gone so I encourage you in those ways great ways to set fitness goals and how to meet them comment below let us know some of your ideas as well give us a thumbs up and we	Success

5 Safe Ab Exercises for Low Back Pain (DO THIS, NOT THAT!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycDk1JNZVwc	ATHLEAN - X	hi guys I athlean-x x4 women and today we to discuss Saif have that problem [Music] okay so the very first exercise that we want to discuss is crunches for the ABS as we know a lot of back problems can come from doing crunches wrong or abdominal work not as prop with proper form or maybe you just have chronic back issues from everyday life or an injury that you effective ways is to elevate the feet for crunches so placing your heels on a step or raising them up can help push the back flat into the pad because the biggest problem is is when you raising that low back up and trying to crunch so it work your abdominals properly you using your hip flexors which is pulling on the middle of your spine so elevating the seat automatically pushes that back flat and then you can perform crunches right here so let seat elevated or you can go tuck them in here usually this works a little bit more effectively because it allows your feet to relax and force the back into the pad so we pushing the back into the pad five more four three two less one excellent good and then the other one is when your knees are up already your back is flat right here in this position or should be so work on that right here is maintaining back flat against the pad and then you this position you further you down so I right here can you use a right above my hip and then I raise up and then back down so contracting the ABS at the top we eleven and I from here down this is my my start this is my finish eight seven six five it keeps the focus on the core four and doesn position 3f is squeezed to last one great nice job so the next one I want to move into is ball crunches the stability ball is an extra piece of equipment that can really support the low back and you can make it harder by adding some weight to it if you prefer so rolling forward make sure the low back is right cut into the ball so you can go no weight at all or you can use a medicine ball here we do 15 on each exercise you really really don to be really efficient if you multiple ab exercises that is unless you something crazy like that we known to do it five more here up and squeeze so I the ball once again this helps support the low back the mid-back and reduces vulnerability on the spine five more five and add intensity you can press 5 4 3 2 + 1 1 great ok and then the very last well 2 more but the last one is going to be a technique so this one is a high plank sometimes the low plank can not give you as much of a foundation for the ABS so your low back starts to sink in down here the high plank allows you to be a little bit stronger and take some of the force into the arms and you can hold it by starting here so if planks are difficult for you are you feeling in your back begin with a high plank first feet together is going to be a little more difficult feet wide gives you a wider stance and supports the bathroom or as well so you can same thing holding you can just hold 30 seconds or as long as you can keeping not the butt up too high not the butt too low tuck it in right here and you can hold 30 seconds and then you can go back around for us we exercises once again though if anything hurts don so find positioning find ways to make sure that you shorten the range of motion and that you core without injuring your back more so one other exercise the very last thing is that more of a technique than anything when you at your desk you can do what we call the vacuum exercise and that tightening pulling in the stomach counting 10 seconds to 15 seconds and you so it you can keep breathing while you pulling in and that transverse muscle which is underneath the rectus abdominis the 6-pack and then you release it then you again pulling it in vacuuming it in pulling those abs in as tight as you can hold it hold it and release it do four to five sets of those 15 seconds I do them while I I do them at work if I computer work it hold it in you it abdominals because you get more of that mental mind-muscle connection the more your training and muscle groups try those leave me a comment below let me know how you guys feel on these ones back problems are going to happen injuries are going to happen so make sure you body so you can continue and have longevity and fitness all right thanks for joining me I next time	Success

Let go. So, the first thing you need is an interval timer. You need to set it for 10 rounds. 10 seconds of of rest and 50 seconds of work. So, what that means is you seconds to rest between each exercise that you seconds. Now, I have my jump rope here. That three, but you don Okay? So, before we begin, if you have a jump rope and you it, then grab it. But if not, I you an alternative. First off, though, let me show you exercise number one. They I them. This push-up, you in push-up position, which your body is flat. So whether you your knees or whether you from your toes, your body should be flat. You shouldn you shouldn keep your body flat, even with your knees. I know sometimes you feel like you want to bend a little bit when you body flat. So, we side step and a pushup. Put it back. Step out like I don see. Step out, push up and back. You can do the same thing with from your knees. Start on your toes. Take a step out. Drop a knee and do a push-up. Put it back. Step with the other foot. You can put your knee down. And notice I stay flat. Do a push-up. Trick with push-ups are this. I want you to try to go down chest to the floor every single time. Bend those arms. Get lower to the ground every time. That how you get strong. Quick little story. When I first started doing push-ups, I thought I was cranking them out until I showed my sister who She\\ those? mean? These are great. need to get lower to the ground. was like, make sure that you push yourself. Get your chest down every time. Okay. Just a quick tip. Exercise number two, you are going to be doing a forward lunge and three pulses. So, you drop that back knee for one, two, three, put it back. Alternate. One, two, three, put it back. I got to show you the form here because it back knee. Don step and push forward. I see that sometimes and it to do some damage to your knees. So, just focus on just dropping that back knee. You Number three is going to be the jump rope. So, if you have a jump rope, it fun. It in, and I recommend doing that any way you like to do them. Some people like to do double feet, which I here. Some people like to do your jump rope with both feet. Totally fine. I like to do these or like these, whatever you want. If you want to hop on one foot, just have some fun with it. If you don but you don then just give me some high knees or you can just run in place. Exercise number four. It different kind of a push-up this time, but I wanted to have some fun with it. So, from push-up position, step forward. This is a pike push-up. So, you going to drop your head from this direction. And then I want you to jump your feet back and forward. Push up. It works a different part of your arm. You hit a little bit more of your triceps and you get the top of your shoulder a little bit more. And then the last exercise, we legs and your outer thighs. So, you going to do one squat, one kick out. Squat, kick out. You seconds. So, those are four uh excuse me, five exercises. We through them twice for a 10-minute workout. And if you have it in you and you want to hit start on that timer again and do it one more time, if you can do it, do it. Awesome job, you guys. I you can do this again next time, I want you to grab some weights and I want you to push yourself a little bit more. So, great job you guys.

4 Best Tips for Strong Abs (SEXY TONED CORE!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sWVONwxA4I	ATHLEAN - X	what athl XX for women and today I want to do a tutorial on those washboard abs so I want to talk about um a little give you a little bit more tips and some knowledge behind how you can increase the strength of your core through those exercises that we did in a previous video but also kind of explain to you how you can make that muscle mind connection happen even more while you doing abdominal [Music] exercises so for the first exercise that we did was the um uh Pikes on the stability ball so one of the main things with your abs is you almost want to have like a vacuum like uh posture okay so it pulling the ABS in nice and tight because you have layers of ABS upon layer so it everything is pulled in and tucked in nice and tight so you actually want to be almost like in a plank position um what and before you ever even begin any ab exercise so this one here was our Pikes okay so we rolled out on the ball so right here before I that pushup I abs in and Contracting them even before I begin the exercise so now I begin my pushup but I have my abs already vacuumed in tight pulled towards my spine then I Contracting them harder kicking back out then I them in even harder and then back down I never lose that plank position so the plank position is when you nice and tight your pelvis is rolled so you someone was going to stock you in the stomach you have a nice hard concrete wall to absorb it so that beginning of any ab exercise you have to have that before really you start to feel um an ab exercise to its full capacity so moving on to the second one was our negatives and this is important because these are a little bit slower these aren you start the exercise you yourself in that tucked in plank position negative negative negative negative all the way down until you can coming back up so the negative is really the exercise on this you have to come back up to get to the negative again so it tight once again belly button towards the spine negative down down down down down down fight as hard as you can and then we important piece in this one is not using your hip flexors so that even when you a hip flexor kick in you but you not actually using your abdominals so making sure that you round here is really important okay the next exercise that we had was this guy here on your back you had the ball in one hand and we and Contracting what on this one is keeping your low back pushed into the pad so you almost want to be concave not convex which is back up push your back back down so it pressing through and exhaling okay and then the we focused more on that left when we pressing then when we switch over to the right you right side as you contract up okay once again you position that perfect pulled in plank position before you even start the ab exercise then the very last one was this guy here the twists okay so we twisting too much at the spine you twisting more in the core opening up here okay so let your shoulder go with it tap grab throw tap grab if you need to you start down here feeling it nice and tight in the core pulled in tap grab okay so it pulling in concave trying to relax those hip flexors as much as you can CU of course they little bit to keep your legs up so even when you is even when you how you are you Contracting your abs when you walking around if you you groceries how are you standing how are you walking our core is always working so if you I automatically your core is working to keep your posture uppr right so making sure that the abdominals are working even throughout the day is another great way to make sure that you people that sit swamped down here your core is completely relaxed it mush so focused on shoulders back helps you to say the only way this can happen is if your core is nice and strong and tight so involving that throughout the day is another great way to just build upon the core the other one that is great for any time is just the vacuum sucks so really essentially if you the car you can be on all four knees and you position and then release so it pulling in the belly button as tight as you can hold it hold it hold it hold it and then release so that gets the deeper most intricate layers of the abdominal muscles and that can help you build upon Pawn to be able to do all of the more challenging core exercises that we we show here on athleen XX for women so leave us a thumbs up below I hope that this tutorial gave you some more tips some more helpful knowledge to understand a little bit more about how the um abdominals work how your core works and how to train it in a more effective smarter way comment below I Amy Joe we time	Success

5 Reasons YouÂre Not Losing Weight (AND HOW TO FIX IT!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EPWzNRvz4o	ATHLEAN - X	hi ladies I XX for women and we are doing a sitdown talk today the topic is five reasons why you may not be losing weight or body [Music] fat so I perspective in my experience um from my point of view on things that really hinder people from reaching their goals and um there might be other ones that you maybe are facing or can think of uh but these are my top five so the very first one that I always like to ask people is how long have you been following this program that you maybe this program is good and will work for you and you just haven following it long enough uh sticking to it being consistent is the first thing that you after day after day uh being consistent and following it long enough also if you also can see if it so giving yourself um trial and air is the best way to find out if a program is working for you but uh stopping after five six seven days um or feeling discouraged after a short period of time like that isn see if something is is working for you cuz it takes time so be consistent start there map out a program so you can feel like this is what I then you know let good time frame to really evaluate um if something that common things I see missing in individuals diets um is protein so making sure that you have enough protein in your diet um for breakfast for a snack post workout for lunch uh at dinner and then if you maybe before bed you add another protein shake or some more chicken or eggs um before you go to bed but protein consumption is too low in a lot of individuals and is probably hindering your weight loss your body fat drop um so calculate your protein and see kind of you know where you about 75 to 1 G per pound of gold body weight so whatever your go body weight is you should be looking at about 1 G um per pound of that so uh your go body weight every day it really think about it um in one egg there need almost four eggs to equal 20 gr 24 G and that eggs so start to break it down get some help if you need to check out the athleen XX uh nutrition programs ask around talk to other professionals do your research find out maybe what is uh the right protein consumption for you but check that out number three maybe you calories or not enough calories so vice versa both of them can hinder progress and by that if you you you need a deficit no matter where it coming from if you or if you you have to get a deficit we have body fat has to be burned therefore it has to come from somewhere so either you eating a little bit less or you exercising more to get that deficit calories if you enough calories the problem there is eventually it will catch up with you and you will binge you have heard of Monday through Friday I plan I guess what hits the fan so focus on bringing maybe your calories up a little bit higher so you can Main maintain through the weekend and not completely blow out um the deficit that you had Monday through Friday so you know um having a night out for dinner and and things it enjoy yourself but you don yourself in a position where you are starving and then you decisions so find that balance that number three number four are you weight training that is a key ingredient a key component of losing weight of dropping body fat is make sure you training not one day a week probably not two days a week I would say 3 days or more so make sure weight training is a huge piece of what you week to week and that you stronger that you enough um once again seek professional um you know help on that if you you know need to hire someone a trainer if you need to uh research and look at more of the athl XX programs for weight training that we offer um do your research get knowledgeable and uh trial and error once again but add weight training in and then number five is maybe you overwhelmed maybe you day at a time one minute at a time checking the Box saying what am I having for lunch this is all I lunch check the box and then you move on breaking things down rather than trying to eat the whole elephant is another tip of mine if you overwhelmed you you going to feel successful and I to be accomplished um at this moment at this time so break it down um focus on the day at hand what am I going to do today that closer to my goals and you can do it I believe it I joining me we time	Success

How To TRAIN and EAT Based On Your BODY TYPE?? (Ectomorph, Mesomorph, Endomorph)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PB2E_3UvM0	ATHLEAN - X	hi guys I for women today we chat and uh this question came about whether women should train and or eat differently based on their body type so body types are uh they compiled into three different um three different uh areas we have a ectomorph which is you hard time building muscle mass you have long long limbs uh not as much uh body fat and not as much muscle mass then you have the mesomorph which is a little bit more rounder uh muscle bellies you build muscle mass well uh but that you know sometimes you can have a little more body fat too that you have to fight off and then we have the endomorph which is builds muscle Mass well but also uh holds on to body fat uh quite a bit as well so there we there kind of um body types then you can kind of break it down into are you pearshaped are you apple shaped um you know what what would you classify yourself as and how would I answer this question yes I do think um that there is a different way to train and a different way to eat uh based on your body type but then again it know you really have to know uh what have you done in the past some individuals might have you know trained drastically hard and you know they need to have some it not working for them so maybe they overtraining and they need to uh take a look at that uh also uh with someone who um needs to add muscle mass of course they um you know endurance exercise and cardiovascular exercise too as you trying to muscle mass so you know take a client who um is long and lean and you know maybe is 510 has long lean legs but wants to add some quads or some arms they more work for weight training um and eat according to that so they are adding enough muscle mass if they incorporate too much cardio they could potentially be using a lot of those calories for the endurance Fork um to go out and run a marathon let 10K bik Rite or or um you know something that endurance-based and so they to be using those that those calories and the the protein grams to Aid recovery for that versus to Aid uh you know recovery for weightlifting and weight training adding enough muscle mass because it takes calories to add muscle mass it takes calories and it takes a hard uh weight training enough pressure uh tension on the muscle so someone who has the longer leaner you know look but want has their goal of trying to increase muscle mass yes they would need to train a little differently than someone who let on muscle mass uh pretty easily so um you know if you lot of muscle mass or you feel like you build muscle mass well and you lot of body fat at the same time you going to want to lift heavy still it not that you want to necessarily lighten your weight but you have to focus on your Nutrition a little bit a little bit more um and making sure that you versus an overc consumption of calories to add more muscle mass so uh and cardio is a is a big piece as well making sure that you know you heart rate to burn calories if you are trying to lose body fat so um you know eating and training it goes hand in hand um you know first of all I depends on your goal so whoever you are what first what are you trying to achieve what working out just to stay healthy and just to feel good and feel fit then you know your training program and your eating program should reflect that so then that choices getting enough protein getting enough fiber eating enough fruits and vegetables and you know picking exercises um and workouts that you enjoy if that then we have other women who definitely you know want to look a certain way feel a certain way look in their clothes a certain way so then it becomes a little bit more more particular about how your training program reflects that and how your nutrition program reflects that so I think it want to follow a program for at least 6 weeks uh six to eight weeks before you can say this is working for me or not um the body adapts at that point as well so I think it and then you can reflect and say okay this is what this exact program has done for me for the six to8 weeks and then you can manipulate it from there um it still individual though and experimentation is critical as you learn about as you learn about your body so um my tips are to uh give it a trial and error six to8 weeks follow a great program a lifting program a nutrition program and stick to it and then at the end of the 6 to8 weeks re-evaluate is uh is my my best advice so leave us a comment below if you have further questions of how we can help you progress with your goals um using your body type and trying to achieve what you community here a family and we continue to help you uh get you customized results through training and proper nutrition thanks for joining me I our next sitdown [Music] bye-bye	Success

WomenÂs Upper Body Workout (CHEST, BACK, ARMS & SHOULDERS!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJuJ78ocY0U	ATHLEAN - X	Hey everybody, it Athlete XX. Today we building better upper body [Music] strength. All right, you guys. With this workout today, we chest, back, and shoulders. Okay, here we go. We push. With this exercise, you really want to think about keeping your core as tight as possible. That back should be completely flat as you lowering. This exercise is all about the push. Okay, so we on the ground, nice and relaxed. We going to have one leg ready to lift up. So, as I going to raise with me. So, as I pressing, my leg is raising and lowering with me. Then we hit the other side. But notice that core. I I back. Everything should be lifting at the same time and up and down. This will really give you a good picture of how strong your core is. Super great. Shoulders, back, everything. So, remember keeping that core nice and tight on the press push. Okay. Number two, one leg push-up kickups. So, with these, what you going to do is you down to a pushup, one leg in the air. You the leg up, up to start, drop down, push up, driving my leg in, kicking towards the ceiling, and I think about getting a good push to try to get your feet up as high as you can. So once again, we push up, up to stand. You feel that through your shoulders, your chest, your core. Super good. Three, walk out V pushup. We way stretch straight. We come up. We not at the bottom like most people normally do. You for a second. Walk up. We our push-up at the top. So, we backwards. Most people do a push-up out there. We shoulders. Just hold that for a second. Walk back up. Drop that head as close to the ground as you can back up and back to start. Okay, now we specifically hit our shoulders right now. I call these one leg traas. We dumbbell in one hand. We stand on one foot. Our weight is going to go back through our heel. You going to drop the dumbbell down. Bring it up next to you. Press to the ceiling and up. Think about keeping this close to your body to protect your elbow. Really get that explosive pull up. Press to the ceiling. And the stronger you get, the more weight you can use. Great for balance, too. And of course, always want to work those sides. I always bring my knee up because it engages my core a little bit more. And you balance and up. All right. So, we specifically targeting our shoulders here. Now, we our back and chest. And what some core in. I call these traveling renegades. A lot of time people just do a renegade in one place. Sometimes I get huge long boxes and make people really travel. I only have a small little box. And I always put my hand on a box too, so you have full range of motion. A lot of times if you you can elevating your body allows you to drop the weight a bit. All right. So we just going to row. If you want to do multiple like 10 to 12, put it down. You other side. We in between. You can walk back over. So depending on your level, let want to do four rounds before you rest. That hip. Keep your hips flat. We driving the elbows straight towards the ceiling. All right, you guys. So, we really worked on our chest and back strength with those press pushes. With the others, we with our shoulders. So, these are these are good indicators for how strong your core is going to be, maybe where you need to work a little bit more. Some of these are tough, but just keep working with them. They will get easier. If you need to do a twoft pushup instead of one, that okay. That start where we comfortable. Okay, you guys. I really hope you put these in your workout. These are so good for building the strength. You will see results with these movements. I love these exercises.

How To Grow Your Butt (4 STRONG BOOTY TECHNIQUES!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7biov2GRf8	ATHLEAN - X	what today I video that I did earlier about a tight booty so we exercises that we did and explain to you why they work and also dive a little bit deeper into that muscle mind connection okay are we ready let [Music] it so our very first exercise that we did I had you do with the Kickbacks right here the point in this is to increase the hip extension okay so you cell right into the glute area because of the resistance on the band so if I were to essentially tuck my hips under like this and go I low back and if I extend this way once again I want to have a nice round pelvis tilt on these so all you need is a small range of motion while Contracting the glute so it whatever muscle group that you to work because what that does that tears down the muscle fibers and increases the size of the muscle so this is a great exercise to do that squats and heavier um exercises are going to really break down the muscle fibers even more but at the same time they also um really burn down our our knee joints our hip joints so we want to make sure too we have that balance so from Sunday to Saturday you can heavy squats the heavy lunges because of what it does for your on your joints the way that we still increase the blood pump into the muscle cell is by using the higher rep exercises like the ones I exercise video so our second one that we did was using the stability ball and this one is similar to the uh kickbacks because when you roll out and you again you don back because you much on the exercise so you want to pelvis tilt roll your hips in then as you heels close together and you squeezing the glutes as you press up towards the ceiling so what that does is the heels are pressed together and you Contracting the glute and it putting so much pressure on there unlike if you had heavier weight on you you could only do eight reps well this one you can go a lot higher reps pushing more blood into the glute area next exercise is our deadlift so this one was the kettle bell deadlift we did a higher rep we did it for 20 so the deadlift here is stretching the muscle right here and as you Contracting not too far forward it just enough you feel that contraction that means you go again once you come up you feel that contraction that means you go again so it right here is where the muscle fibers are tearing okay this is tear contract pump tear contract pump pushing blood in there so that nature of the kettle bell doing it nice and nice and slow keeping your back flat tucked in opens up right in between the hamstring and your lower glute so that allows to build that area the uh very last one that we did was the band around your knees and this one is great because it they hurting your hips or knees so you put this around your your knees and there there think this one think they there so just pay attention to that when you here you go up on your toes already you feel the difference in your glutes contracted than if you were down here so it glutes and making sure that you getting the right contraction in the right area with that muscle muscle mind connection and then you squeezing on these so this one the outer glute just enough so if you too big range of motion that getting it it smarter not harder so this is essentially pumping more blood into the glutes once again when done correctly so the nature of the glute the glute muscle is it so we want to make sure that you doing quite a bit with them because it a a large muscle group so you can have a day where maybe going a little bit heavier with your squats and your lunges and really tearing down the muscle fiber putting a lot of tension and putting a lot of force um on the glute but then there involve this um that is not so heavy and hard on your hips and knees as well um so this is another great way to incorporate glutes and once again if it probably going to want to incorporate more glutes throughout the week versus someone else who um you know feels like it would do it once or twice a week so hopefully these tips tutorial gave you um a little bit deeper of uh understanding on glute exercises how to um really create that muscle mind connection um with the glutes and I mean it applies to all muscle groups really it we talking about what are we what exercises are we trying to dive into so leave me a thumbs up comment below if you guys have other questions um because this is important if you can go through the motions and expect the same results if someone else is doing the exact same exercise that you are but it has that muscle mind connection and is really thinking about every rep that they harder uh I hope to um see you guys next time hope this video was helpful for you and um we	Success

5 WORST Ab Exercises for Women (AVOID THESE!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YEP2B9kRcE	ATHLEAN - X	hi guys I and Xs for women and today I show you something that important five exercises that are the worst ones to do for your abdominals you ready for me to show you let [Music] started our very first one is the infamous twisting with a light bar or broomstick you before right here this is a no no right here twisting side to side right so I you what not to do this one is not good for the ligaments in the low back and your connective tissue it is not can really give you injuries in your low back so never do that one for the waistline another one to avoid are side bends with two dumbbells so you probably will see individuals using two dumbbells to do the side bends like this but holding one on the other side actually negates the force of the ABS so just use one I see it all the time so you just want to use one to contract up not two and then you would switch and now all the force stays here up and Contracting that oblique this way if you hold two dumbbells as as you side this one is helping you come back up again so avoid using two dumbbells or help somebody else out and let them know just use one next one is another twisting exercise to avoid number three right here so if you do have low back problems or spine problems avoid twisting at all times this is like a Russian twist so it when done properly with someone maybe with a healthy spine or really strong developed abdominal and core muscles it can benefit them but for someone who is not or has back problems like I was saying it increase your risk of of injury or hurting your spine further along hurting those ligaments and connective tissues once again so avoid the twisting that number three number four one is uh the swimmer kicks which once again are great for you but when done wrong it you put your feet out you see this a lot come up so you low back and if you you it you great one to remind yourself to avoid push that back flat and develop stronger core muscles and then swimmer kick that is done properly so making sure that that one also remains correct and our last one number five right here going to the bar again this one is when you bend forward and I and you Center twisting up again you this one is Infamous for your waist as well but you want to avoid because it that low spine right here we taking a lot of the pressure and a lot of the force right here and it over time especially if you don enough uh core strength to hold you up so twisting and any odd frame is really not good for us not good for a healthy spine healthy posture and rotation should come from the trunk not necessarily right in the waist either so those top five are to avoid for the abdominals stay injury free my friends because we want longevity we want to be doing this when we avoid those exercises that are not good for you or protect yourself and make sure you have proper form when working your abdominals thanks for joining me leave us a comment below on any other exercises that you might know of that aren some problems with as well we hear from you check us out athlean XX for women and I next time	Success

5 Best High Protein Breakfasts for Fat Loss (FAST & EASY!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhka8Ho58cI	ATHLEAN - X	Hi guys, I Athleen XX for Women. Today we sitting down and talking about five healthy fast breakfasts that you can do that are going to help you with your fat loss. High in protein, ones that are convenient, keep you going on the go. So, my first tip is the little Greek yogurt ready to go containers. I love those things. They out, throw some fruit in there, and you to go uh peanut butter direction, throw a tablespoon of peanut butter in with your Greek yogurt, and you are well on your way. But the ready to go containers are already prepped for you, and there no um meal prep that you need to do on that. So, that make sure you have in your fridge. Number two are smoothies. I about this in other uh videos. Smoothies are excellent. They quickly. They high in protein. You can throw spinach or kale or other vegetables in there as well and throw in blueberries, Greek yogurt, protein powder. Um and those are a great one to even prep the night before. So you could throw everything in Tupperware, put it in your fridge, and then in the morning just blend with ice and some water, and you So smoothies are an excellent one. High protein, good for fat loss, and um are definitely great for for breakfast time, the breakfast hour. Number three, moving into one of my favorites when I am super slammed, super busy, have no time, boiled eggs and a piece of fruit. Boiled eggs are um excellent just to go. You can eat them in the car. You can um eat them literally in a couple of minutes. So, those are ones that I always have um in my fridge. And then a piece of fruit, obviously, an apple or banana or orange. That that just outrageously busy. Number four, omelets. When I do have more time, I love making omelettes with veggies and a couple whole eggs in there, two egg whites, and then I throw some, you know, pico deayo or avocado on top after. So, omelets are a great one when you have a little bit more time in the morning and can do that. Uh, my last one that I absolutely love as well is overnight oats. Uh, you make them uh there of great recipes out there just so it just depends on, you know, how you prefer to flavor it. But, uh, you can prep it the night before, throw it in the fridge, and then it um, in the morning. So, that one, too. You can prep the night before and don morning. That on your way. Add that with a protein shake, and that convenient one for uh for breakfast. So, I know we all get busy, and that of the the major things I hear from clients is, to eat. That preparing ahead of time. So, knowing that, you know, tomorrow is going to be a crazy morning. We out, have it stacked up in your fridge, ready to go for the next day. So, those are um some great tips for a healthy, fast breakfast that will leave you reaching your goals. Thanks for joining me. Leave some comments below. Uh let us know what is maybe one of your um healthy and fast breakfast that you like to use. We tips as well. Leave us a thumbs up and we will see you next time. Thanks for joining us.	Success

hitting upper body meaning shoulders biceps chest and back which is a great thing to do we all done and more and workout so the amount of kettle bell you use the weight is totally up to you you can go heavier you can go lighter um I suggesting maybe 10 to 12 reps definitely three rounds though you want to get a good workout with this we going to do five different exercises so we now we to overhead press so with this one I use a 10 lb whatever you with if you want to use five you can go 15 20 however strong you are or new to a workout it per individual okay so with this one we going to get into that nice te position a slight Bend in our front leg core is nice and tight we back totally flat we kettle bell we up keeping the the Bell up towards the ceiling we we we leg back out go into a row pop up straight up to the ceiling so we core we great movement because I love that it uses your entire body so once again we straight back out row pop up up to the ceiling row pop up and down okay so we always have a dominant side that dominant side so it for me to balance don have a less dominant side like this is going to be for me keep working on it I know one side may be a little trickier than the other we motion we row we straight to the ceiling back down wowoo think about keeping that core nice and tight the bell throw you off a little bit and straight up to the ceiling it that feel your body and understand kind of how how to kind of keep your body in control and up and down all right love that exercise it kind of wakes us up gets everything firing all right 10 to 12 of those next we extension now with this one you probably can go maybe a little lighter weight I going to just stick with my 10 we plank position a nice wide stance we going to bring the Bell up to our body we ceiling kick it up we hips low nice tight core really getting that full extension at the top and back down so once again we to try to do if you can that though here and we up think about slowing it on the negative or the down so you swinging it like this think about controlling that motion and down great for obliques okay hammer curls when you do a traditional curl with a dumbbell traditional curl as soon as you rotate the wrist it turns into a hammer curl kind of the same thing here we could do it this way it just feels awkward to me so I prefer doing a hammer curl so you up and back down straight up all the way down full range of motion really think about squeezing at the top to where you up to the top of your bicep lowering it down and up down and you have to give a pretty good squeeze on the handle too which helps to keep the the Bell up and down then we switch to the opposite side we down up straight down so once again we going to think about doing 10 to 12 if you your third round and you really you know that was pretty easy think about going up and your kettle bell weight not a lot if you maybe a 10 go to a 12 see if that makes a difference or jump to a 15 you don want to take on too much weight too quickly okay now we hit our biceps now we raise we shoulders this uh this tends to be a little bit harder muscle to work so if you need to drop down and weight for this one that we about a two count then we turn to the side let me turn my body a little bit more here so you can see what I raise to the side and hold if you want to get a a little bit better stance you can raise hold for an iso count of two lower to the side raise and lower and lower once again don drop the weight think about controlling that negative or that down Mo that down motion okay we side we and down off to the side we two isometric holds make a huge difference in gaining strength even in your workouts if you just take a second to just do that two to three second hold makes such a big difference you will be amazed at the amount of strength you gain with doing isometric holds all right you guys we and down all right last exercise this is a plank tap this is going to be great for your back and once again we there a little bit so I I take a bigger Bell for this cuz you want a lot of stability of the little bells you could probably use but it this has a wider base to it so what you you position you the bell and you touch back down you can have a slight Bend in your back pop up we a pushup we Bend in our arms to just make us kind of work a small amount of range of motion but I shoulders my back my chest to hold myself up on that Bell then we to the other side we same motion we bit of a pop touch and up I mean if you want to go into a full pushup you can but I this is just a little bit of a pop it really works your arms Works your back and chest all right you guys we moves we body keep going three rounds you really need at least three rounds to get a great workout in build that strength either tone or build whatever your goals are all right I hope you enjoyed that workout check out athl XX forwomen docomo work out or do for that day they check it out it like

Instead of a push-up position, you your feet forward and your legs are going to be straight. You start with one foot on the ground, one foot out, and you That we jumps. You your box, swing, go into a squat, and you arms. And I want you to stay in a squat back down into a squat. Every time you land from a box jump, make sure you landing softly on the balls of your feet into a squat. So, I want it to look like this. Otherwise, if you slam onto your feet, you to your joints. So, I want you to be careful. Number three, you do a pushup with a knee tuck and shoulder taps. So, from push-up position, you going to go down into a push-up. You going to get up, double knee tuck. Looks tough, but give it a try because it think. Just think about being quick. So you want to drive, put your feet right back. If that then just jump your feet forward and back. And two shoulder taps. So it looks like this. That Number four, we box jumps. These are going to be this box is going to be the bane of your existence for this workout. It really tough. I added a ton of box jumps in there because it cardio, but we well. The other exercises that I have for you are targeting your shoulders and your abs. So, number three is going to be, excuse me, number four is going to be box jumps. Number five is going to be a leg drop and reach. So, on your back, you want your legs up in the air. You at the top, and reach up. Touch your toes. Now, if you down, great. If you need to rest at the bottom, bring them back up. And then reach for your toes and drop. If you can keep your shoulders slightly off the ground and don the ground. That is number five. And number six, box jumps. Be doing a lot of box jumps today. Okay? If for some reason they become too hard and too tiring, then what I want you to do is grab your jump rope and you can throw in the jump rope and you can do every other box jump. Do a box jump and then when it says box jumps again, grab your jump rope and do jump rope. Okay, awesome job. This is going to be a tough one. Good job you guys. I hope you enjoyed that workout.

Shoulder Workout for Women (SHRED YOUR SHOULDERS!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9xGSIlzsLY	ATHLEAN - X	we shoulders [Music] today we different exercises today to really hit those shoulders we the ground with a three-way shoulder raise what going to be going from hitting the front of the shoulders to the sides to the back it uh move here and we you in a plank position you can get a nice wide stance and we straight out off to the side straight back back to start now you can either rest in between if you need to by putting the weight on the ground or you can just keep a flow for forward side back and of course once we with that side we the opposite side we same motion we forward side back really think about keeping that core nice and tight and with the weight you raise it you can either raise it straight here and then rotate and back whatever feels comfortable to you that okay 12 to 15 reps next we go into a one leg Travolta you have quite a few different weights here a lot of the movements we sometimes we the position with that when gravity is making the weight a little heavier with this one you could probably go a little bit heavier so the reason I this a one leg Travolta is because obviously of his famous dance move it towards your leg you to your shoulder up to the ceiling so it okay so we this one too we foot popping up straight to the ceiling up to the ceiling woo this is very good for working balance and down so make sure you get that nice pop here especially the heavier you get the worst thing you can do is try pulling that weight out like that that you really want to protect your shoulder by keeping it close to your body fast pop straight up to the ceiling all right then of course we would go to our other foot as low as we can get it to the other foot pop up nice tight core straight to the ceiling to the ceiling and here okay love that exercise it your legs are getting it you have to keep your core tight to keep yourself straight T holds with this one I would probably start with a little bit lighter weight because this is an isometric hole for quite a while actually you can hold it anywhere from 10 seconds to 20 seconds so with this one you to go into that t position we to have a nice straight back tight core and we weights out and we hold so I we trying to keep them as straight as possible then you down and relax do maybe a 10 15 second rest period then we nice flat flat back Abend in our front leg our core is nice and tight keeping us straight our whole body is shaking and we with those 12 to 15 reps is going to be a lot you can drop that down to maybe six or s seven reps if you need to once we get a little bit stronger and that gets a little easier maybe you seconds then I would move up to maybe a little bit heavier weight challenge yourself a little bit more tapping raises once again tapping raises you going to want to go with a little bit lighter weight cuz this is got a lot of movements a little bit of an isometric hold so with this one we raise to the side brief hold forward brief hold back out to the side tap at the top back to the side front again out and down so there you we back to start up overhead back here tapping and down last one I we back to the side tapping out and lower so once again this felt pretty easy for me if I seven reps of that and it feeling pretty easy that going to move up to maybe six lbs think about small small increments when you moving up with exercises like that you don it that muscle developed in a in the right amount of time and not over kind of overstepping the balance of our tendons and muscles and it said baby steps T flies okay with a tfly this one we can probably go a little heavier we t position we straight back a slight Bend in the front of our legs we the backs of the shoulders we going to bring the weights up I think about a bird and its wings I have a slight Bend in my arms I my head once again I and my head completely in alignment so I the backs of my shoulders my core is tight all right so once we hit 12 to 15 we going to hit the other leg a lot of us have a non-dominant leg this is mine so it tougher we motion bringing our arms up as high as we can core is tight Bight through your balance one thing I find with balance is if you start falling don tighten up it your body flow back into that control okay you guys five great exercises for your shoulders we hitting the fronts we tops we hitting the sides that want to think about when you the shoulders it you hit everything to get that nice rounded luck with your shoulders so like I mentioned 12 to 15 reps the tapping touches maybe a few less with that one cuz that tough three rounds though push it to three rounds if you want to see any gains remember small increments with your weights if it starts getting a little too light bring it up just a little bit check out athleen XX for women.com if you haven sure you subscribe that way you get the videos

(5 IMPORTANT QUESTIONS!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMjlyQbIQGQ	ATHLEAN - X	hey everybody should women be taking protein powder here are five reasons why they [Music] should so here are five of the most common questions we protein so my first question was will it make me bulky that common question we asked and no know it will not make you bulky if you take protein powder as a women we just don have the testosterone the muscle mass you build largely depends on whether you physically train with lifting weights so if you physical exercise every day let running and all of that stuff and you take a protein powder it not going to bulk you up it helps support lean muscles that help create a toned curvaceous body it recovery and repairing after your workout the second question was will it help control my Hunger absolutely eating protein with each me meal actually helps keep you Fuller and it actually helps stabilize your blood sugar which is a good thing so instead of reaching for that fat-free muffin think about eating eggs chicken or fish some kind of lean protein and um maybe a quick uh protein shake our third question is can I use it as a meal replacement so if you rushed to make a healthy meal that when protein shake comes in really handy think about adding in some source of a vegetable maybe one to two uh fruits and some kind of healthy fat um along with the protein powder you can easily get 20 gram of protein in with that missed meal the fourth question is does it help with fat loss absolutely using protein shakes as an occasional meal replacement may help you lose more weight and fat along with a low calorie diet it to only replace one meal a day with with a protein shake your other meals should consist of clean Whole Foods consisting of protein carb complex carbohydrates and vegetables and our final question is will it help me now that I become a vegan so people who are pursuing a vegan or vegetarian lifestyle eliminate a number of common proteins from their diets including beef chicken fish and eggs so by adding in a protein drink on a daily basis it will help you get that daily protein intake that your body needs especially if you after your workouts I hope this V video was really helpful for you guys for people who are maybe not quite sure if they want to add protein powder into their diet um I results with athleen RX for women they have two different flavors they have vanilla and Dutch chocolate which I really love it calories and super high in protein it really does help you with your recovery especially for all of you active women out there hopefully doing our workouts on on athleen XX forwomen docomo you can find the protein powder athleen XX forwomen docomo to start your new nutrition plan	Success

Best Home Thighs Workout (USING ONLY A BAND!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2jH1gw9enw	ATHLEAN - X	Hey you guys, we band workout today. So, I had never really used bands until recently, and I really found out they do amazing things for your body. They anywhere and the stronger you get, you just move up in your resistance going to a heavier band, which is great because you don of expensive equipment. So, I just put together a quick little workout you can do at home or anywhere if you traveling. Uh the first things we going to start back start with are kickbacks. So, with these, if you just starting out, maybe use a lighter uh band width resistance and then the stronger you get, you can move up to a little thicker band. You maybe want to have a wall or something to hold on to for a little bit of stability. You into your band. You just want to try to get it around right above the knee kind of, as you right above my knee. Sometimes they get a little twisty. All right. So, once we have that in place, just think about doing a mule kick. What really focuses on the top of the glute right here. really starts building which helps kind of raise up the entire glute. So, what we have a slight bend in our waist and we back and just really think about getting that nice hold at the top. You feel that top of the glute engage. Just swing back kicking the leg up with just a slight hold at the top. Of course, when we sometimes the bambles roll a little bit, but that back out. Mine are new, so they little they so they right now. Okay, so we the same on the other side. We going to kick slight bend in the waist. And I just really focusing on that glute area. So with these, I would do anywhere depending on how much resistance you have in your band. I would do maybe anywhere from 12 to 15 and I would do three rounds of that one. Okay, so the next we squats. With this one, I I band on. It that Um, but a lot of times with this one, you may just want to go a little bit lighter band. Having some trouble with rolling today. Okay, in-n-out squats. You feet together. We out, squatting all the way down and back up. So, this is great cuz it adding a lot of resistance to the outsides of my legs. So, I nice little outer thigh workout and here. And of course, the glutes. So, it motion, but it to my normal squat because it me really work to get my legs in and out. Super great for outer thighs. Once again, 10 to 15 reps, three rounds. You can do this whole workout as a circuit or you can do all of your rounds together. Okay, next we lift, which will focus primarily on just the front of your quad here, which is really nice. This one I bit lighter band cuz this exercise is a little tougher. So, with this one, you going to start it around your ankles. Once again, you wall or something to hold on to for a little stability. And it doesn have to be a really high movement. I just raising and lowering, raising and lowering. So, I am feeling this right all the top of my quad. It really gets a nice burn going super fast. It doesn take a lot of resistance for this one. But as I mentioned before, the stronger you get, you range of motion and it the top of that quad. And even if you want to put a little bit of an isometric hold, which is super great that builds a lot of strength. That thing. Another great thing. 10 to 15 round or 10 to 15 reps. Three rounds again. Super good. We all these targeted areas, which is nice. Okay, now we ground. I same band. Not a ton of resistance. This is about This is a medium band that I using, so it heavy. You side. Think about making sure your butt is forward. My feet are going to be flexed. And I lowering. So now we just the outer thigh here. Raising, lowering. So once again, if you want to have a little bit of an isometric hold at the top, it going to add that extra burn and really start toning really well. So of course, once we finish, we always want to rotate over. Same thing. Nice straight line with our body. We Feet are going to be flexed. We raising and lowering. So maybe after you these for a while, let your three rounds at 10 to 15 reps and you feeling a little easy for me. Go up to the heavier band. Maybe go from the medium here to the uh heavy. All right. And the last exercise we is we calves. With this one, I use a little bit heavier band just to feel a little bit more resistance. So, with this one, all you to put the band under the ball of your foot. You body up. I way because once again, it have the wall for stability. So, I going to think about keeping good posture. The band is putting a lot of resistance on my on my hand and my arm, but as soon as I raise up, I feeling the pressure of expanding this band. So, it So, it calf muscle. So, with these, you want to go up, hold for a count of two, lower to the ground, up for a count of two, lower to the ground. It doesn these to start burning, which is really nice. Up and down. So, with these, once again, we 10 to 15 reps. Super great. Don your calves. I notice in a lot of workouts, people never really throw in a calf exercise. You really want to make sure you include those. All right, you guys. I hope you enjoy this workout. You can do this anywhere. Super cheap to find these bands. Throw it in. We all the areas that are so great to target to tone. Hey, check out athleenexx4women.com for all your fitness needs. And I look forward to working out with you guys soon.	Success

So this is great to just warm up, get things\\nactivated, and you those through the glutes. So a good place to really build, especially\\nduring bikini season. Okay, so we Let me get my dumbbell out of here. Actually, no. I We need that for round two. Lateral pop lunge. So once again, you can hold any amount of\\nweight. We So you really pushing off that leg to get all the\\nway up. Kicking up. So we This is great for building there. So we Once again, we We So if you want to do more toning than building,\\nthink about using a lighter weight and a little bit heavier weight if you want to build more. 10 to 15 reps. Okay.

That is a quad burner. I love those. So for that, if you can do 10 to 12 reps that Those are good. You Final move, med ball roll back jumps. For that you The other thing I love about these is, the\\nmed ball actually helps you get up from the roll back. A lot of people have trouble with roll backs. So this is a great way to learn them, or to\\nactually even help you up because this works as a counter balance. Okay. So with a roll back, you always want to make\\nsure your feet are straight on the way down, and on the way. I for your knees. So always just think about keeping your alignment. So we the ball helps project me forward – and\\nthen I just go into a weighted jump. Okay. So this is what it Don’t roll up too high. Never roll up on your neck. Keep it to mid-back. So we And we we jump up. Once again, killer exercise to work full range\\nof motion. You Okay, you guys. Those are five super great exercises to tone\\nthose legs.

Worst WomenÂs Diet Mistake! (COUNTING CALORIES??)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJnb_n19fwA	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] hi guys I and xx for women and today we sitdown talk of why calorie counting is not necessary so when we discuss calorie counting really we want to talk about more the breakdown of that so there protein there and realizing that at every meal you need a great balance of all of those uh what protein at each and and every um meal whether it and the reason being is it drives your metabolism helps you recover after hard intense workouts and we weights right so we definitely need a little bit more protein than the average bear um so how we do that and not necessarily have to count um is by portion so understanding that a meat palm of the hand a piece of chicken a piece of fish um a Ste piece of steak all of those things are great uh knowing palm of the hand and um when you go to snacks looking at uh not only meats are what going to give you your protein but also understanding that nuts will there Butters seeds seed protein yogurts so at least getting a serving in of protein at each and every individual meal will definitely help you and and also realizing why you don those calories um is because you know that you every single meal and that um the what metabolism so start with protein understanding that you get you getting that portion in at breakfast a snack lunch a dinner and then build upon that then build upon your carb carbohydrates um a serving is half you know half cup half cup of of Oats you got um you know a 4 oz 5 O uh potato and realizing that that is then the secondary after you figure out where your your protein source is coming from so um if you are balancing it out in that way you don calories you what your body is um is needing and understanding that portion control is way more important and having to calculate everything out and um figure out what is best for your for your body also then moving on to fats is about 1 ounce of nuts um a tablespoon um 2 O 3 o of avocado and spreading that out throughout the day as well so you have a good balance of of carbohydrates protein and fat at breakfast at lunch and at dinner and then your snacks in between can be a little bit lighter but controlling the portions allow you to feel full sated and also knowing you don so check out athl XX for women for a nutrition guide and for meal planning and way more tips and guidance on how you can lose body fat and not have to count calories how relieving is that right so check them out give us a thumbs up leave us comments below let us know some more of your thoughts and ideas and um stay tuned for more thanks for joining me on Amy Joe we time	Success

Beginner Upper Body Workout (ARMS & CHEST FOR BEGINNERS!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OikpWR6du34	ATHLEAN - X	hey everyone it with athleen XX for women today we going to be doing my beginner chest and arm [Music] workout okay you guys this is my beginner arm and chest workout so this is for people who are maybe new to using any kind of weights or let recovering from an injury orill ESS and you just want to take something light um this is probably a great workout for you so with the weights today I want you to use whatever you feel comfortable using it about getting our form down and um probably doing more reps so let keep it a little bit on the light side the first thing we with is a knee plank curl and what I mean by a knee plank is you what I call a half plank so you going to put your body forward your knees can be apart and it your core a bit that it I I always try to engage the core with a lot of the work that I do you just going to have your weight in your one hand you fall down the best that you can and you curl the dumbbell up and all the way down once again full range of motion not just here all the way down all the way up if that gets to be too tough on your core it so it little bit heavier with with the resistance because of of gravity pulling it down in the position that we okay we if you can 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 we back off to our other side here we we our core do some work and one 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 once again if that can be here and just curling here okay so that is our first exercise next we this kind of the half plank now we going to hit our Tri biceps so we legs shoulder width apart we bring the weight up to the side we going to try to drop our butt a little bit and we ceiling two 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 once again for the people who may have a little bit of trouble with that holding it that way you can just be here to just keeping it this keeping it a little bit easier on the core but it always good to work the core it figure if you your triceps you may as well be working your core at the same time all right so here we go other other arm and one 2 3 four 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 all right great job you guys next we our mat we pushup so so this is a great way to learn how to do what I call an actual boy push-up where you which would be here into your pushup but we little easier we knees but the key with these is this time you really want to bring your butt with you a pushup shouldn my butt in the air I need to bring it with me so it so we drop down if you want to bring your knees up however you comfortable keep them close to the ground it actually makes it a little bit easier that think about this guy as luggage you going to bring him with you you going to leave them at home up here okay so we you can do three five 10 however many we with me until you need to stop and one two three four five 6 7 8 9 10 and actually another great way if that wall push-up I love wall push-ups what you do is you just go against a wall and you lean towards the wall and push back lean towards the wall pressing back so think about pushing through your scapular area here cuz we we it bit so that if that do tricep push-ups we mat our lower arm is going to hug our body we straight cuz it movement a bit easier even though it little challenging but I think it good beginner movement you to press up lower down however high you can go and I just want you to engage that tricep a little bit so even if you little bit that working the muscle up and down so let if you can you can with me and one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 okay we over hit the other side so so we going to do the same thing our lower arm is going to hug our body we out get our arm in the right position and we one two 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 all right and progressively if those get easier for you if you bend your knees it resistance here it little bit tougher you more resistance so that would be more for the intermediate Advanced group but if those were easy that progression you can add in okay you guys last exercise now we chest directly of course I bring in a little core we press so a bridge you lay on your back feet about shoulder width apart you and the idea is to try to keep your hips up the whole time if you feel them kind of progressively moving down just self correct and bring your hips back up you dumbbells we we and we together back down to the ground up and back down really think about squeezing at the top not only here with your glutes but with the dumbbells at the top for your chest okay here we go we for 10 and one two 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 you can also if you with that bridge just keep your back flat on the ground and just do that same movement here okay these are great beginner movements to help you build some strength get a good foundation to either adding more weight or just doing harder exercises in the future okay you guys I hope you enjoyed this workout I really enjoyed it I hope you check out athleen XX for

(STOP DIETING!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8smhLoUcLs	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] hi everyone I athlet XX for women and today we want to do a little talk a nutrition talk about how to stop dieting how to lose weight and I have some of my tips that I share with my clients and I um make sure that I make sure that I am staying in the shape that I want to be in so my first tip is to eat more protein I think that um in general we know this but are we applying it are you daily applying it um from when you wake up in the morning to when you out at a restaurant what are you ordering thinking about surrounding your plate with the the protein centered um so making sure your snacks are high protein when you things in your car and understand that there those days that you and you prepare things so plan ahead uh the other thing is fiber are you eating enough fiber which not only comes in vegetables you think fiber you think vegetables but it also comes in whole grained breads it also comes in Fruit it also comes in um uh brown rice and sweet potatoes and things that you might think are you know a complex carbohydrate but they also carry uh a lot of fiber as well so make sure that you are getting enough of that not only to feel satiated but also um to make sure that you you know definitely binding it to body fat and helps excrete that out of the body as well water are you drinking enough water making sure that you determine if you just lacking water uh so make sure that you have a big gallon and um you know it takes time to refill water so make sure that you have that with you throughout the day and you your water intake I like to drink close to a gallon a day especially because I work out so I than the person who is not working out so be um you know thoughtful and mindful of that as well got to drink more if you talking about workouts you want to surround your workouts with carbohydrates sandwich them with the carbohydrates so make sure that you know we evil the evil stepsister here we want to include carbohydrates but what is your timing like so think if you do a 10: a.m. workout maybe the perfect time to have you know that piece of fruit or the the oatmeal or a couple pieces of toast would be 8:30 9:00 a.m. and then when you get home again that when you want to implement some more complex um carbohydrates sweet potato brown rice oatmeal um those kinds of things around the workout then the rest of the day uh maybe stay away um from high amounts of them so I that you don day but everyone is different so um maybe finding a specialist to kind of help you figure out what those exact numbers are for you to lose weight is important the other thing is um and I think this is a big one is read get educated read scientific journals and um make sure that you know what and things do your homework so if you want something so bad as to you know lose body fat and then then search it out you know read the things that you know are um you know written by professionals and uh things are changing how to lose body fat and uh studies change all the time so making sure that you and things that are giving you the right information studied information and um proven studies is important um which also leads me to my last tip is that you want to make sure when you media that who you you look up to and who you you um are listening to and taking advice from make sure that you do your homework on them as well so there out there and social media is huge these days make sure that you understand that they have a degree or they are educated or they know um what they about so uh do your homework on them as well and don anyone that claims they professional so those are just a few of my favorite tips that I share with my clients and Implement myself to help you lose body fat and to stop dieting so let athlet XX for women leave us a thumbs up some feedback below so we can continue to give keep giving you these great videos thanks for joining me see you next time	Success

5 Ways To Drink More Water (SUPPORTS WEIGHT LOSS!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAMMakJc5DQ	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] Hi guys, I Athleen XX for Women and today we discussing how to drink more water. It difficult. You get busy during the day, you forget one of the main things to drink water, prevention from dehydration. So, my first tip for you is when I wake up in the morning, this is right next to my bed. I fill it up and I right when I wake up in the morning. So, this is a great way to ensure right before you actually step out of your bed, you in before you start your day. The next one is use a big container. So, if we have to refill this four or five times throughout the day to get our eight to 10 glasses or you have to fill this up just one time, I probably get more of your water in if you use a bigger container versus having to take the time to fill this up four and five times to aim for that 8 to 10 per day. So, get a big container. Stop using a small container and I you my next one is use a straw. Use a straw for water. you a lot quicker than if you would just be drinking it. It other shaker bottles I know out there starting to are starting to incorporate a straw in them. So, if you want to have a bigger bottle with a straw attached to it, look for those or use a straw. And my last few here, first one, uh flavor your water. That that you water if you look forward to tasting it in the afternoons or evening. But majority of our water should be clear. The other thing you can do is measure what you 12:00 during the day, I drank that much. So if we start full, this is your marker. Make markers on your water bottle. can also help you have a goal and set a marker to 12:00 p.m. I at 300 p.m. I will have drank that much. Then by 5:00 p.m. I will have drank that much. And then by the end of the day I have dranken my entire container. So that ensure that you get more water in during your day. Thanks for joining me. We see you next time.	Success

One leg push-up. Jump forward. Now gonna jump to the other side. Stabilize. Hands down. One leg pushup. If that becomes too challenging, both feet, right? You can still do a one leg push-up if you want or just do it regular burpee. jump to the other side and push up. Your choice, whichever you feel more comfortable with. And then lastly, number seven, 10 high knees, drop down, power up. I love hate these because it great exercise, but like I now. I can round of these. So, 10 high knees. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Drop down to your belly. Pop up so your whole foot is on the ground. I don this. Notice how I just got on the heels of my feet or excuse me, on the balls of my feet. So again, seven, eight, nine, 10, drop down. And the reason why is I want you to explode to your feet.

one foot up in the air and you pull your abs towards your face and what we maybe about six to S really think about tightening that core bringing it close to your face we super great for strengthening those lower core stabilizers and the lower ab it also helps protect your lower back since we do so much work in the the front you really have to protect your lower back good job you guys okay now we going to put both feet on the ball and now we concentrating on raising the lower lower portion of your core towards your face so when we eight we second because we warming everything up activating

everything and warmed up okay you guys next we going to move to roll outs we can move our mat out of the way so for beginners you can use two feet for this once again this is great for really strengthening the entire core front and back so now we kind of start warming up the back area a little bit hands are just going to be about middle of the ball you roll out nice tight core I usually hold for a couple seconds and then I to roll back up roll back out just hold for a couple seconds sometimes I ball a little bit just creating an unstable environment you can tell on certain areas of your abs that maybe feel a little bit weaker so it of get a little of movement with that ball sometimes so kind of move around and just hold for however long you feel comfortable if this is too long

and back out okay those are our roll outs okay I guy out of our way so he in front of me next you your mat and your wider towel we what let you cheat at all so you position like you you towel a little wider than shoulder width apart the key with this exercise is rolling your core up and back but notice how I letting my arms come forward I up above my head as I two so this really focuses on the core

How Much Protein Should Women Eat (HOW MANY GRAMS PER DAY?)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chslwgYvnXA	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] hi ladies I athleanxx for women and today we want to talk about how many grams of protein should women eat and the main reason why we wanted to do this video is because we do believe that women don protein and protein is really important to reach any goal if you add muscle mass if you leaner because in the digestion process it actually increases calorie burning and also when those when the protein grams are digested it turns into amino acids within the body and helps your muscle cells recover and you sore and your muscles then grow so when your muscles are bigger and they grow then our metabolism increases and we have a lower body fat percentage so that within the body and so so important that we get enough it also helps keep us full and regulates blood sugar so we want to make sure that we throughout the day uh and ensuring that actually every time you eat you are eating some amount of protein so uh the rule of thumb really is 75 grams to one gram of protein per pound of body weight so I like to encourage clients to use a scale a food scale and weigh your protein because every every you know slice of turkey or beef um contains a certain amount of uh protein grams in it so then you know you know if you ounces usually rounds out to be about uh 10 to 12 grams of protein so if you weighing then you know how to calculate and how much protein you for that meal so make sure that you getting in enough throughout the day if you are lowering carbohydrates also because you calories you want to make sure that your protein grams uh increase at that point in time too so make sure you enough and um you get to get a food scale make sure you protein and don of the biggest um nutrients that we can do to increase metabolism increase recovery and keep you satiated all right thanks for joining me and we will see you next time	Success

[Music] So, one of the first ones I want to show you is that IT band. Placing the foam roller on the floor, you want to extend one leg out. The the leg you to work goes right on top of the foam roller. And you at the top of the hipbone and press your way all the way through. And you can lighten it up putting more pressure on in your hand and shimmy your way down all the way to the bottom top part of your knee and then back up again. It right out of the IT band. Then you can flip over to the hamstring. Let all your weight sink into the foam roller. Push down. Shift your body. So the foam the foam roller pushes those knots right out of the hamstring all the way down. And then you can even transition down into the calf. So put the foam roller down. Lift up. This one gets it. My calves get nice and tight. All the way down. Back and forth. You can even twist the foot side to side. Get your gas stro good all the way down to the solius. Okay. And then quads. I you on that same leg. So this one you position on the knee. You can either do both legs at the same time. Start at the top. Bring your toes up and just relax your muscles. Let them sink into sand. Let them sink into the Mr. foam roller forward. You can also twist. Turn your toes out. Put the different heads of your quadriceps and toes in. Foam roll those knots out. And then one of my favorite ones is aligning it horizontally or vertically here. Lying down on it right on line it up with your spine and then you stretching out those pecs. This is a great stretch. Opens up the pecs, stretches it out. You can even place balls in your hands and it stretches out where we get really tight from sitting all day long.

Real Time Challenge HIIT Workout (24 MINUTES...WILL YOU MAKE IT?)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnrFmCSNhQ8	ATHLEAN - X	Well, hi. Welcome back to my backyard. It trained together back here. I all over the place with Athleene X and I back to home base and give you guys an old school workout real time. So, I picked out a few exercises for you today. You will need a sandbag and a jump rope, possibly a mat depending on what you get going. 24 minutes. Okay, 24 solid minutes. Can you do it? Yes, you can. 10 seconds of rest, 50 seconds of work, 24 rounds. Let [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] go. Okay, you guys. Exercise number one is a jumping dragon walk. You going to jump in and do this with me. Set your timer for 24 rounds. 10 seconds of rest, 50 seconds of work. First 10 seconds is a countdown. Let go. You the room. Push up position. One knee to elbow. And you up. Get as high as you can. If you a slippery surface like I am, you can just pop up and switch in the same spot. Or if this is if the jump is too hard, then you out. When you get to one end, turn around and go back. I might just have to do it in one spot and flip it everywhere. So, I to go here and jump up. All right, 180° touchdowns. So you can do the most advanced which is a jump tuck or just jump and touch. 30 seconds. I tired. Come on. So sad my dog is sadly looking at me through the glass. Focus. I want to just go pinch your cheeks. 7 seconds. Come on. jump rope. Any kind of jump rope you want. Make sure that you just try to keep try to keep moving the whole time. You don running place, or high knees. Come on you guys. Push. Two left feet with those jumps. All right, Superman power up. You to need your mat. A Superman, his arms and legs extended at the top. You contract and then you your hands here and you power up up off the ground. So, it power up. If for some reason that hard with both hands and legs um to get off the hands and feet to get off the ground, you just pop up off your hands. Okay? or you extend and then just get up. Always try to give me one or two of the most difficult version. Then we Everyone grab your sandbag. The sandbag of mine is 40 lbs. You through your heels. Squeeze at the top. You want to pretend that there in front of you. So, you don scrape anything on the wall. So, if you actually were to go to the wall, I don know if you can see me, but you want to get down and up. Kind of an exaggerated thing to do, but it helps you with your squats. Push through your heels. By pushing through your heels, you and your hamstrings, your quads are going to be working no matter what, but we want to get the back of those legs involved as well. Okay, next one. Some jump rope. I tingled. I have two left feet today. We have 14 seconds. Let [Music] Come on you guys. Stand tall. 10 seconds to rest. This next exercise is tough. Hands down. This might be hard because my I going to push up and you jump forward. Both knees and put them back [Music] down. I and see if that better. Yes, it is. So, here doing. Push up. Tuck back. Push up. Tuck back. Modification is from your knees. You can still try to give it a tuck. Okay. Over under. You position. Extend one arm and leg. You are going over your body, under your body, over. This is a controlled movement. For modification, you can keep your legs, your knees on the ground and do an over and then an under or you can keep one here. I to tap behind your body and then knee so that you keeping that foot planted on the ground over knee. Okay? But I want you to try to get up for at least one. Again, it a controlled movement. It speed on that last exercise. Back to one jumping dragon walk. This one is a little awkward because it just going to walk it out. How about that? I Here, you up. Walk forward. Notice I put my chest down as far as I can. You want to bend those elbows. Bend. I don Bend them down. If you have to put that knee down, okay, so you can do this. Put it down and push up. And then you can switch. Okay. and push up. Any of these push-up exercises can be done from your knees. Improvise while you middle of it. Just don beep. All right, 180° touchdowns. Not my favorite, no, but I like what they do for my body. I like how movements like this speed up your metabolism. And these are the exercises that keep your body burning calories for 24 to 36 hours. I got to shake it out. Take a breath. Keep going. Shake it out. Maybe you just keep squatting it out. If you can try to start to gain some strength, give me a jump one again. All right. Jump up. I don feeling it. I worked out really hard yesterday and I was hoping it would make me want to power through today I thought I to. All right. Superman powerups. All right. On this, remember, extend. Hold it at the top. Hands under your shoulders. Hop up. Extend. Pop up. One modification. You up or just come off the hands. But for all you crazies out there, and for those of you who are watching yourselves get stronger every workout, I want you off the ground. Let go. 5 seconds. Come on. Give me one more. Nice. Squat it out. Grab your weights. Squiding down and up. This is all about getting a better you. Stop comparing yourself to other people. Compare yourself to the old you. That I better than I was yesterday. And that it. I want to be better than me a year ago. I want to be better than me two, three years ago. All right. That it about. All right. Jump rope. All right, here we go. Try it again. Find her happy place. Got a long road ahead of us, you guys. So stay with me. Turn that part of your brain off that tells you you push. Take a second if you have to, like I do sometimes. Catch your breath. Keep moving. Push up. Double taps. All right. So we are here. We are pushup, double tuck, push up, double tuck. Modification from your knees. And then you can go here. Go here from your knees. Pushup. I arms and your triceps really involved. That Jump. Come on. Holy cow. These are hard. Even I modify. You guys don But also, if you time, don right, over under opposite arm and leg out. You going to touch over, extend it out, touch under, alternate. And these are going to be done for my knees today as my arms feel like they are over here, under switch, over here. I for under. So for the over, I for modification. For the under, I up. Okay, number one. This is the last time through, you guys. Jumping jogging walk. Make this one count, you guys. Last time through. We minutes. Let walking or jumping if you slippery surface. [Music] My feet wet ground not liking me today, but I going to try anyway. Okay, jump. Come on, guys. Push. We there. Come on. Give me one more. Where are we at? One. That Okay. For me, this one is the most challenging. The 180°ree touchdowns. Squat down. Touch. Touch. Every time. Touchdown. If you can kick it up and give me a jump tuck and give me a jump tuck. Make sure you land softly on the balls of your feet, which I did not because I was tired. So, that makes me know I squats. You have to shake it out. 14 seconds. Three. Two. One. Jump rope. 24 seconds. Sometimes you just need one breath, one big breath, and keep going. Nice job, Superman. Power up. Superman power up. modification. You get up, that Wide it out. 20 seconds. Five, four, three, two, one. Jump rope. I got some breaths to catch up. Come on. Let minutes, you guys. Three more. You need to take a second. This is high intensity for 24 straight minutes. So when you have to take a sip of water, it to take one breath. It push. Every time your body says no more, give me one more push-up. Double tuck. Unders. These are tough for me right now. I than this today, but for some reason my arms are like nope, so I as I can. Most advanced. Two. Three. Four. All right. My body wants to quit. Come on. One more. All right. So, from now on, the rest of this minute, I So, I tuck, one push up, tuck. My arms are thankful for that beat. All right. Over, under, you guys.

30 Minute Abs and Shoulders Workout for Women (FOLLOW ALONG REAL TIME!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b8BhrxX1zc	ATHLEAN - X	hey everyone it for women today we my sculpted shoulder Core [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] workout okay you guys our first exercise we bar front raise so you can grab a straight bar it doesn to be super heavy CU these are a little tough and I do everything on one leg you don want to get a nice shoulder width stance that one leg I I probably couldn having standing on one leg so you just going to do this with your hands about shoulder width apart and we just going to drive it up towards the ceiling and slowly lower it down you can you can actually drive it up a little faster I just want to see the lowering or the negative a little little bit slower so we 10 to 12 reps here I now 10 and this is great for the fronts of your shoulders for starting with the front of your shoulder today and 12 okay we core exercise this is how I normally work out once I finish whatever exercise I workouts we situp you your towel a little wider than shoulder width apart these these ex this exercise actually pre prevents you from cheating so you towel over your head and you sit up if you that stay up and over your head the best you can so I isolating my core here to do all the work so really think about rolling your core back and rolling it up so once again our goal for today is 10 to 12 reps with my talking I may forget how many I take a guess with somebody these I think I you don too bands anything that you may have at home okay you guys round two here we go remember raise up a little bit slower on the down the reason I stand on one leg is cu it actually isolates your core a little bit more should start feeling that burn right in the front of your shoulders okay don reps today I may fluctuate anywhere between 10 and 12 okay here we go second round towel sit up rolling the ab up and down six we just keep self-correcting yourself if you find your arms are dropping and you pushing it out just really think about keeping those arms up over your [Music] head is just a great exercise to kind of get your core activated before you really do any other intense core work okay last round you guys going to stand on my other foot this time your dominant leg always wants to take over always remember use your non-dominant leg too when you leg halfway there good last two so use a lighter bar if you to tone and use a little bit heavier weight lower reps if you kind of build a little bit more okay here we go last set of our towel situps we 12 this last one we concentrate keeping that towel up and overhead halfway there last one all right we okay next we to overhead press so for that you need your mat and light to moderate weights Okay so you weights sit on your mat you butt with your feet off the ground you and you raise you in your core for more advanced you can actually have a straight leg and this is going to make it even a little bit more tough but make sure you keep your shoulders and chest up you don slouch through your back and 12 good okay for our core exercise we going to do a side V up we to move that out of the way here mat okay you your side and we touch for the side of our foot two three four good we each side rotate over same motion reaching up as high as we can we getting that body off of the ground okay round one round two here we go for anybody having trouble with their lower back or if it back you can just do this sitting really straight just make sure you kind of push your head and chest up and that will help alleviate the lower back issue all right here we go last two and 12 good job you guys we here so if you need to take a longer rest that long shorten it up you need okay here we go 12 on each side all right sing over okay last round you guys great okay here we go leges up all right last set of V UPS okay if anybody finds these too easy what I do is I try to reach for my bottom foot that actually makes it a little tougher let little bit more okay here we go last step always take a water break if you need to you want to stay fully hydrated okay next we into a side plank lateral raise so so far we our shoulders the top now we move to the side of the shoulder what I love about this too is we engaged by doing a side plank super lightweight cuz these are tough you guys doesn heavy when you first start these out you lower and raise the stronger you get the more weight you can use the more advanced can raise a leg once again I may be guessing a little on the Reps bear with me all right here we go opposite side remember once again a little a little slower on the lowering not doesn slow but just a little bit slower all right good job for our core we a push plank with this you can use like a large book at home anything that moves it doesn have to necessarily have weight to it it can because we are still kind of hitting the shoulders a little bit but this is more I with this one so you get into an elbow plank you take your object and you to press it out pull it back make sure that hip doesn as flat as you can since I weight I reps with us we other side same motion flat hip [Music] all right good job little water okay we second round and you don have to use weight or you can have one knee down if you want to use weight cuz we you want to have a little resistance on that shoulder okay getting over nice good breathing I know this gets tough breathing into through your nose com out of your mouth all right good job you guys we getting there we good Pace let here we [Music] go it bit okay [Music] okay third and final round taking a little more water here okay and 12 okay last one on this round okay you guys just keep pushing through keep in a good Pace here all right good job okay last set of our plank [Music] push [Music] okay other [Music] side okay you guys we great a few more exercises left okay going to take just a little bit more of a break right now okay next we to hit the back of the shoulders we going to go into a plank lateral raise so when working the shoulders I always make sure I front top side especially the back the back is is what nice cap okay here we go so for this you can use a chair a bench anything you may have at home so you to kick out to a straight body keep that butt down straight arm you it up and out a little slower on the lower so with this one your hips going to want to open up with you think about keeping it closed off okay going get the other side all right good job okay for our core we a a weighted toe reach so just a thin M now for this you can depending on your Fitness level you can go light or you can go a little heavier what I love about this exercise is that it really focuses on the upper AB it really helps build the upper portion of your ab so you to grab your weight or dumbbell you feet up in the air and you to really reach for that toe so the object is really getting your back off of the ground all right round two you guys we getting there we right now okay it Super heavy weight for this this part of the shoulders actually t be pretty weak compared to other parts of the shoulder so don a super heavy weight for any of these exercises it strengthening and toning those muscles okay reaching up our second set of toe reaches okay guys last round I know I long rest periods kind of working on our endurance a little bit here that a workout Tempo Pace keep it going okay here we go last set you get tired your hips going to want to open up try to keep it down okay let side [Music] okay last round here you guys really think about getting that weight as close to your toe as you can getting that back off the ground really pulling with your core Bo I Sur of your shoulders too which is good okay last set of exercises here this is going to be a little more aerobic this has all been pretty anerobic meaning we toning our heart rate is getting up there but these are more building exercises so for the last round we pushup for maybe some people who have shoulders issues or not as advanced this might be a little tough so what you going to get into a v hands over head over your wrists and you just going to drop down and push up just try to lower down to the ground as far as you can these are really tough if this is too advanced that really hard um possibly anybody who can that maybe just go down and just do a knee pushup cuz that hit the your shoulders a little bit so for for our last exercise along with the pipe push-up we push back so once again we going to be hitting the shoulders but we and back a little bit so this is a pretty fast little movement you you come up you don too far you just want to kind of reach fairly close in front of your body with a wider than shoulder width stance you push back and the whole idea is to have enough momentum to push yourself back so these I only suggest maybe anywhere from five to eight reps depending on your Fitness level so here we go we back we up push back so the whole idea is you don get right next to the ground just enough motion to push yourself off the ground okay next set are pike push-ups again okay so we that Pike stance walk our hands out a little bit try not to flare your elbows if possible I know it so it hits your triceps and walk back up okay you guys good job we there stick with me even roll backs are very core intensive too so if you trouble with them just think it of the core pulling your momentum forward w all right you guys drinking that water last set of our Pike to push up okay here we go we over walk our hands out a little bit okay you guys this is our last set of roll backs here we go [Music] hey you guys I really hope you push yourself with that workout today for more realtime

Best Ways To Lose Weight (TRUTH ABOUT LOSING WEIGHT!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4x1T6DPORo	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] hi guys I want to talk to you guys about the best way to lose weight so understand that I there are a lot of ways to lose weight but it can you maintain that program for multiple years even so these are all questions that you need to ask yourself and I want to make a few points about um some of the main things that are going to help you sustain a program and give you those results that you for that will last the rest of your life so my first point is obviously nutrition we all know that that is one of the main ways to lose weight and by weight I mean body fat um but realize that it our hardest thing to achieve working out in the gym you can hit a workout hard but nutrition is what you with the rest of the day so you go to the gym or you workout for maybe 30 to 60 minutes but nutrition is those choices that you make the rest of the day the rest of the week the rest of the year those all add up and the that what through nutrition you want to make sure that that whatever your goal is so with that point I want to talk about two main um nutrients protein and fiber those are the most thermogenic nutrients that we can take in our body which means when you the digestion process it burning more calories so so eating those are going to be one of your two solid ways to reduce body fat having enough protein and having enough fiber so those are the two things that you want to make sure of with your nutrition um that going to help you feel full and saturated um and give you those results uh that you me to my next point of eating your meals throughout the day we want the sustainability and you want to have enough energy when you go to the gym or if you want to have enough recovery throughout the day so making sure that you getting enough food and not thinking oh I want to save calories um for multiple reasons and then at the end of the day you get home and you ravenous that you so you want to be careful to um spread your meals out um throughout the day that is going to work for your schedule so you levels very steady and not going up and down which which causes the yo-yo dieting so um that point with nutrition and also eating your meals meals consistently throughout the day now I want to move into strength training and our workouts strength training definitely it it fat loss than anything else so if you going to take example a sprinter and um a long-distance Runner which body would you prefer well the long-distance Runner um isn guarant guaranteed that Sprinter is doing strength training workouts breaking down their muscle fibers and in turn they leaner and in general people you see who are going to weightlift versus um members that or people that you see that just do steady state cardio for hour two hours plus every day they fat percentage in general but when you increasing those fat burning hormones that are going going to push your metabolism past the point of where you way that you can change your metabolism and also you want to change your physique you you want to tighten and change the way your shoulders look change the way your waist look change the way your legs look the only way you strength training and lifting weights it physique looks um and in turn once you build th that muscle and you down those muscle fibers during strength training workouts during the recovery process it you when you calories because your body is now made up of more muscle mass um and then the the last point I was going to talk about is the intensity of your workouts so yes strength training is key and not two hours plus of of of steady state cardio but where you training or if you are going to be doing a little bit of cardio here and there um where is the intensity at so you change intensity with two things either you can do circuit training and keep it very fast-paced or you increase weight so that increase your intensity while you strength training or if you do um cardio you can do the hit workouts where you quick quick quick hard hard pushing just like sprinters so the circuit style burns more calories in less amount of time and you get out of the gym and on with your day all of this athlean XX for women believes in and we provide all this information um for you guys to have and um really help you achieve the goals that you looking for so check us out at athleen XX for women and hopefully you guys can see why people over here are getting the results that they want all right I Joe we	Success

Upper Body Stretches (How to Stretch BEFORE vs. AFTER Your Workout!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWVb2sEMZBE	ATHLEAN - X	hey guys Jess here with athl and xx for women today we stretch routine for the upper body to make sure that you type of stretching at the right time because as you know stretching can be very beneficial to your training program but you just got to make sure you using it [Music] right so here out of your stretching you want to make sure you stretching at the right times whether before your workout or after there are different types of stretching you can do and the type really does matter athletes know this if you your workout it should be dynamic it should be moving and it should be warming up your muscles instead of having them just be cold and flat static stretching you want to save your static stretching for the end of your workout where you are actually interfering with the length of your muscles you don want to do that before your workout cuz that could really mess up your contractions but at the end of the workout or even at the end of the day right before bed static stretching is perfect okay so here today dynamic stretches that are perfect for using before your workout or getting ready for any sort of physical activity to loosen things up and get you prepared and then I static stretches that are incredible for actually making a difference in your flexibility and perfect perfect for using as your cool down after your workout Begin by touching your fingertips to the top of your shoulders and then draw big circles with your elbows as far as you can really reach those elbows and then when you few reps of those you can extend your arms fully straight and do like a swimming motion reaching from the back to the front so make sure you elongating all the muscles in your rotator cuffs and loosening up those shoulders and you can do as many reps of these as you warmed up so now we the opposite direction reaching up over your head back behind you and then down to the front those feel great for the shoulders now we alternate side to side stretches so this is opening up your obliques and your lats as well as your triceps reach as far as you can overhead while leaning your torso towards that direction and it helps if you look to the towards the opposite side now we shoulders and the triceps you to swing one arm across your chest while pulling it towards your body with the opposite arm I like to use the back of my wrist or the forearm to pull that arm all the way close to me and you can slightly twist your body side to side but make sure you emphasis on the shoulder and now into tricep overhead stretch this is a dynamic way to stretch your triceps taking one arm up just give it a slight pull back behind your head hold it for about one second release and then do the other side now we with interlocked fingers so starting with your hands in front of your chin then reaching up and over your head placing the top of your palms towards the ceiling then bring it back down and go up overhead again make sure you really pushing your chest out and now to warm up the spine and the back we going to do the cat Cow position you can either do this on all fours on the floor or you can do it standing like I here by just placing your hands on your thighs so that was a preview of what Dynamic stretching would be like now let going to take that same shoulder position pulling one arm across my body but this time just hold breathe and focus on the lengthening of the muscle and do the same thing on the other side this is the type of stretching that you want to save for after your workout or after the end of the day before bedtime to really focus on stretching your muscle and you do want to make a difference in the length of the muscle fibers so it these stretches for a long time for the purpose this video just to keep it short and keep your attention I demonstrations of how to get into these poses and how to hold them but for maximum results I holding these for at least 20 to 30 seconds per stretch the one you see me doing right here is to open up your chest with your forearm against the wall walk your body away from that arm and turning outwards so you can get a good stretch across that chest muscle this is excellent for improving your posture now as these are static stretches and they are intended to be held and not Dynamic and not moving like the other stretches it is important that you keep striving for more length so see in this position it relax you actually do have to work if you want to change the position of your muscle fibers although it does take some work and you should be striving to go a little bit deeper and a little bit farther within the stretch now shall We Touch on some of the ways to stretch incorrectly how about this one just holding the position without any sort of effort or any sort of intention just going through the motions into the positions but without actually applying any stretch that way to never see results with your stretching routine if you through the motions but your muscles are not actually elongated to their full potential stretching shouldn you should actually be feeling something and actually making a difference now here stand your posture nice and Tall really stretch the fibers and really make sure that you you we hope you learned from this video that there is a right type of stretching depending on the time you and there are also right ways to stretch whether you just make sure you intention and you the muscle instead of just holding the pose it does make a big difference in the long run and these are the small things that you you use the athl XX Roman program it all in the details and all the details are covered in this

Stretching Routine: Best Lower Body Stretches and Foam Roller Exercises	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8N_0sP2It4	ATHLEAN - X	hey it I couple of you have been complaining about either tightness is or injuries or Si issues lower back pain things like that and things that are stopping you from getting results out of your program because you challenging moves that are going to get you the results you want if you get injured and you can can sure that we prevent injury so that you can actually do these challenging moves and then you can benefit from them [Music] in order to get fit you need to be able to work out continuously and progress over time and not have any sort of setbacks with injuries so come with me today we going to show you a stretch routine that you can do anywhere you can do this at the gym after your workouts you can do this at home uh before bed or first thing in the morning whenever you can fit this in it only takes about 5 or 10 minutes and it of difference in your Fitness results okay the first thing we is take out our foam roller it looks like this if you haven of these I highly recommend ordering one online they it house that you can use anytime you feel like you need a massage or if you have like muscle tightness is that you need to work out if you don these you can also use a ball but it going to be a little bit more intense and this is just easier to use so I recommend getting the foam roll here what we it you so our first stretch is the IT band this is the uh muscle that runs from the knee to the hip and this often gets tight from doing a lot of high-intensity cardio activity so it you take care of it periodically stretch it by foam rolling it out so we to start up at the hip here I going to take the top leg over the top so I can use it to push and then I roll back and forth like [Music] this now one of the important things about foam rolling is that you need to find that muscle tension and then hold it for a long enough period of time so that the muscle actually does relax once you find that spot that feels kind of crunchy and kind of tight like there something in there it smoothly over it but you feel some some lumps or some sort of tension and some pain that on and you got to hold at least like 20 to 30 seconds and you difference when it relaxes all of a sudden it will be like the muscle just gives up and kind of surrenders that feeling you really uncomfortable but if you want to actually get rid of the tightness and actually notice some improvement you got to kind of get over that pain threshold so a little bit longer than 20 or 30 seconds holding on that tight spot and once you find it you just kind of hold still breathe and then just let go of all the tension sometimes they down onto the elbow like this and so you can just fully relax our next stretch is going to be for the quadriceps so all you to do is turn facing the floor now so this position right here and I usually like to go down onto the elbows and then you yourself forward and then do the same thing [Music] [Music] back oh you you can adjust yourself over to one side and get the front of the Quad like so and do the other side now moving on to the lower back and glute area this is important for those of you who have Antica pain or any kind of pain that the leg raising or any of those lower ab moves that I showed you last week this is a great stretch that can really make a difference for you so try this one you of the foam roller then roll your body slowly down this direction until it reaches your lower back and then you going to lay over it take it slow until your shoulders Hit the Floor now your next step is to raise your knees up and then Rock side to side [Applause] [Music] you can also spend some time just rolling out the glute muscles by doing this position right here one foot flat on the floor the other leg extended out straight and angle towards that side now there stretches I like to include that don involve the home roller so you can just set this off to the side for now we are just going to work with our own body weight and stretching out the hips glutes hamstrings whole kind of hip area okay our first one is going to be the runner with your right foot in front and then just stick your left leg out behind you and in order to really focus on the glutes and hamstrings and the lower back we that front leg as far as you can so I usually put my hand on my hip here and just try to pull that shoulder back while pressing my other shoulder against that knee the goal here is to rotate as far as you can but you towards you so that you this part right here and really feeling the stretch so hold the stretch for at least 20 to 30 seconds or until you feel your muscle kind of relax and open up okay we other [Music] side now for our next stretch we going to go into the pigeon pose so you may have done this one before this is one of my all-time favorites for stretching out the hips to get into this position I usually start from the plank cuz I find it the easiest way to get in so go ahead and get into the plank position here and then you pull your right leg up lower the knee down to the ground and then relax your body over that leg and after about 20 or 30 seconds switch and do the other [Music] side and moving on to our last stretch this one is called the figure four so I usually like to do it in a seated or standing position either way is great but we might as well do it here from the floor since we you knee and and then pull it up towards your body and I really want you to bring your chest close to the shin as possible for some of you it may look more like this and that feeling the stretch but if you little more flexible you can pull it all the way in and press your ankle towards your shoulders and same thing on the other side all right guys that stretch routine I hope that you can utilize this after every workout that you do the hips and glutes are such an important part because they most of your body weight so really take care of your hips and I want you guys to stay healthy so you can continue to get results and unlock your potential so you can become lean and athletic train like an athlete recover like an athlete and you results of your life so if you have any questions about these particular stretches or anything else I video at all just go ahead and

5 DIET MYTHS Keeping You From Getting a FLAT STOMACH Flat Belly Secret for Women!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY3i67A6pnc	ATHLEAN - X	Hey guys, Jess here with Athleen XX for Women. Today we the top five biggest diet myths out there when it comes to weight loss and the number one principle that I to demonstrate right here that is going to always steer you in the right direction. [Music] I have three cups right here in front of me that you can see. I demonstrate the one principle that you need to always remember when it comes to your diet and weight loss goals. This is really important. So, first I fill up this one glass. You know, just imagine you for a glass of water. How to satisfy your thirst. You can see I hardly fill it up with any water at all. That be like m not enough. Now what happens with this one? No, too much water. So you can see I made a huge mess all over the table and now I have to clean it up. So too much is not good either. Now on the third one. There you go. Just the right amount. So, we call this the Goldilocks principle, and it means not too little, not too much, just the right amount. This is what I want you to always remember when it comes to your diet. Don get it right every time. And if you not sure what the right portion sizes are, then you Athlete XX for women nutrition program because it has a portion size guide in it that to relate foods to things sizes that you recognize like a softball or an iPhone or something that you can use to visually estimate so you don to use a food scale. You don to count your calories. Is going to make your dieting a lot easier. Okay. Now, we myths. Things that are commonly believed that are absolutely not true when it comes to dieting. Myth number one, there everyone should be on and everyone can get results with. False. We all live in a different environment depending on where you live in the world. Maybe a warm climate or a cool climate could affect your diet. Also, accessibility to foods is different for every individual. And also, people differently to the level of carbs, level of fats, or level of proteins. So, your diet is something you are going to need to experiment with to find out what works for you. Every single individual is different and unique. And this is why we make our plans so flexible so that if something have options and ways to change it. This is the most flexible diet out there. We also guiding you along the way so you don like you have the control to make it personal. Myth number two, going on a diet means that you give up the foods you love. Because let not good for you. Completely false. I know that many people believe this and it just going to have to eat nothing but cardboard and celery sticks if you want to lose weight, but that is absolutely not true. I think you you read our meal plan and you see all of the different foods that you can actually build your plan with. and still get amazing results. It pairing of foods, the timing of your meals, and combining it with a great exercise plan that is going to get you the results you want. Myth number three, you of exotic pill or powder that comes from some berry or newly discovered miracle fruit. Definitely false. I hope you know that this one is absolutely not true and there are no supplements needed to lose weight. Myth number four, any food that must mean that it loss, right? False. If a food claims to be a diet food, don company to help you lose weight, but they don actually want you to lose weight because if you did, you product. So, trust the whole natural real foods like the ones we lay out in our diet plan, and you the best results. You don worry about fat free this or sugar-f free that if you foods like lean proteins, vegetables, and whole grains. You are not going to need to worry about reading labels anymore. We out of it, telling you exactly the right foods to eat so that you don fooled by those false claims. Myth number five, and this is a big one. It about counting calories. Myth number five is that you have to count your calories and stay underneath 1,200 or 1500 or some very low number in order to lose weight. This is absolutely false. You do not need to count calories. It can be a helpful tool just to learn how much is the right amount quantity of food for you. But after you learning process, then it yourself free from counting calories. This can be frustrating and it can be a really unhealthy habit if it you counting your calories. Follow a solid meal plan like the one we for you and you worry about any numbers. We hope you enjoyed learning about these top five diet myths and that you won anymore and you know the truth about diet and exercise and the real way to get results.

Tone Your Shoulders With ONE Women's SHOULDER WORKOUT Tip!!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ld9LBn4Wpc	ATHLEAN - X	hey guys Jess here with athlan XX foran today we to round off those shoulder caps and make sure you get tone and definition to your [Music] shoulders first let the top mistakes that women make and men do the same thing too when trying to tone your shoulder muscles so first of all what does it mean to be toned if a muscle is toned is that the same thing as being strong or being large the answer is definitely no tone is something very different from strength or size tone refers to the tightness of your muscle even when it you can see muscle definition without flexing that is what we call a toned muscle and that don size that is not what our program is designed to do that this is the way to trim tighten and tone because the way that we exercises is not going to grow your muscles it stronger but it is not a max strength designed program so today we talk about what tone is and how you can make sure with every exercise especially with shoulder exercises because those are some of the most tricky ones that you we first of all let do it now you tell me if this looks [Music] right all right so what do you think of that leave a comment now if you can spot what I was doing wrong okay now let over the right way to do a lateral raise first of all the number one tip is to not think about the moving part so just because you don your hands because that from the muscle you change your focus bring it inwards and you want to focus on the joint that actually moving here and the muscle that is moving it so this is called your deltoid and we want to really make sure that you get a contraction of the deltoid cuz movement is not the same thing as a muscle contraction so do it right now that try the difference between just moving your arm up easy and then actually moving it up but flexing it and squeezing every muscle really hard so you already feel the difference that muscle tone is when your muscle feels hard contracted and flexed and now the other really important thing about lateral raises is your posture now if you slumped over posture that is not going to do as much for the delt as it is going to be for the traps this is your trap muscle right here that leads up into your neck and I know I see this common thing a lot where women are overusing their traps and underusing their deltoid so make sure before you begin that you roll the shoulders back and down and you expose the deltoid and relax the Trap so now that we posture under control and we focused on the hands but we focus on the deltoid muscles a good lateral raise an effective one should look something like this notice I keeping a slight Bend in the elbows at all times because if you lock out your elbows you in the tendance of your elbows then in the dels itself also keep the Palm space downward so you have that sort of internal rotation which is putting more pressure on the Del all right so I hope that you can definitely see the difference there in the second time around I focused on the D Muses flexing them and squeezing them with each wrap and yes the pace is going to be a little bit slower because it allows me time to mentally connect with the muscle so try slowing yourself down fix fixing your posture and changing your focus remember in order to get your muscle to have a toned appearance you push it to failure so it has a reason to harden remember results are adaptations to impos demand so you need to demand for your muscles that it harden up tighten and tone or else they you supposed to know how many reps how many sets and what weights to use in order to get toned I know this can be really confusing but that is the whole reason why we put together the athlan XX for women workout program it along and you don the thinking for yourself all you do is pop in a DVD use your home equipment or you can take the girl on the go-karts to the gym with you and it you what weight to use how many reps how many sets and how many exercises per workout and how many days to work out and all of those details that you might be wondering if you so take all the work out of it and same thing with the nutrition plan like we like to say eat more and worry less and all you have to do is follow step by step and walk into the new toned body that you video is helpful

Upper Body Workout for Women (In JUST ONE EXERCISE!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkZ6p2XbXe0	ATHLEAN - X	hey guys Jess here with athl nextx for women so you shoulders arms and entire upper body well I have good news for you even though I there are some upper body exercises I can amazing one that I can do and I doing a lot of it over these past two weeks that I think you guys are going to really enjoy and I the benefits and why you should do this even regardless if you have an injury or not you could even do it on both sides it difference when it comes to getting that toned upper body look that you [Music] after first let benefits that come from unilateral training which just means to train one side of your body at a time and this the same thing goes for legs if you to train one leg at a time there are three huge benefits to this type of training I know a lot of times it can seem like it you can be more efficient by working both sides at once but if you both sides you three benefits the first one being joint strength your joints get strengthened when they are exposed to instability and nothing is more instable than working on one side at a time you can just right now stand on one leg and notice how your ankle muscles have to contract your foot muscles are all engaged same thing goes for your hand hand it work your wrist stabilizers elbow and shoulder so you joint stability which is going to be better for your overall performance the second benefit is core strength whenever you automatically Flex so not only are you getting the that one limb worked out but you same time so of course that benefit right there the third one being increase calories burn because of course it once than it is to work out with both legs if you don ahead and try a one-legged squat right now and feel how much harder that is than doing a two-legged squat try switching your workouts up and throwing yourself on one limit at a time I going to show you this one upper body move that difference for toning your upper body okay guys are you ready for this this one move is one that you been avoiding because it happens to to be one of the hardest exercises especially for women it is the one armed pushup and this has been a personal goal of mine for many years since I started training and when I got involved in fitness competition I made it my priority to learn the one arm push-up so I and techniques that can help you perfect your one arm push-up even if you starting from a place where you can even do a regular push-up I have a progression that the most beginning beginners okay so I going to just turn around and work on this wall right behind me here and our first one is going to be a wall assisted one arm push-up start by placing your hand on the wall at about chest height now you about halfway down and then press till your arm is all the way straight this is the first progression for beginners now if that variation feels easy to you which it may not it challenge in itself but if it does try this one stepping your feet just a few more inches back or maybe another foot back as much as you can handle place your body at an angle towards the wall which is going to make it more difficult step three is to move down to the ground now grab a chair or a bench whatever you have on handy that ground and for this one I the knees and just practicing lowering the body down and now if you pop those knees up get into that flat plank position notice my feet are pretty wide and my hips are slightly angled that arm push-up you have to kind of reenter the body since it because you another little spin on it that you can try is placing your nonworking hand just behind your hips this is just adding a slight bit more weight to your push-up making it a little more challenging here what curious about the alignment of the shoulders or the hips notice that as I lowering down I towards the right side because that the only way to go you got to get that elbow kind of outside your body so that means you lowering down to one side and then pushing back up to the center okay let progression now the one arm pushup go ahead and place your feet down on the ground wide apart with your hand in the middle lower body halfway down down and then press to the top do your best to keep your alignment in check and your core tight I hope you really enjoyed this one arm push-up progression tutorial and that you to get started with your unilateral training remember you can do this with almost any exercise just use one limb at a time and you building a strong core strong joints and burning tons of calories now if you looking for more ideas and interesting creative tips tricks and techniques on how to get the most out of your exercise definitely go check out

Best Butt Lifting Workout Tips Exercises for a 3D Butt Lift!!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgTKQZisVzQ	ATHLEAN - X	if you if you have a 2d flat butt right now to turn that into a round 3D bubble butt the answer is yes and stay tuned to watch this video to see how you can transform into that food delicious bubble [Music] butt hey guys just here with athl next for women I am here today to show you our two pro tips to help you get that 3D bubble butt look first let the setup and structure of what our butt muscles are and what that means for their shape as you know you have your hip flexors in the front this area we consider these muscles to be the hip flexors this is your tensor fasal latte and your sartoris what happens is they tend to get shortened when you seated position and then the opposing muscle muscle groups which are the gluteus maximus medius and Minimus tend to get elongated you can see that that naturally happens when your leg is in this bent position as it is when you seated so for most of us we for most of the day unfortunately just with our modern Lifestyles we spend a lot of time at the computer and just a lot of time on our butts which unfortunately does not make them look very attractive but here there that you can accomplish within about 10 minutes a day that can really dramatically change the shape of your muscles first let can do to elongate your hip flexors so this is the problem right short hip flexors and long glutes so what we need to do is the opposite elongate here and tighten here so what I today is show you two tips that can help you alleviate the tightening of the hip flexors and then two strengthening moves that are going to help you tighten your glute so let me show you our top two stretches that are really great for opening up your hip flexors and elongating those muscles our first one is a semi lunge so I just want you to come down in just a short lunge right like this and then push your hips forward and automatically you to feel a stretch right across the hip flexors now to intensify this a little more take the hand on that same side and reach it up over your head and this is going to draw a straight line from that hand all the way down to the ankle and then you can even lean with it hold each stretch for at least 20 to 30 seconds to reap the benefits okay on to our second stretch for this one you may need to use a wall to help your balance so that completely fine go ahead and put one hand on the wall and you kick up one of your legs go ahead and pull it back using the same side arm and to really emphasize the hip flexor stretch so you in your quad I want you to release your foot a little bit away from your body and push your hips a little farther forward and that is really going to help you feel it right in that spot so like I said use the wall for balance if you need to and really keep pushing your foot back back and your hip forward all right so great we are halfway there to the solution you have already just elongated your hip flexors but now we have the other half we got to tighten up these glutes so I show you two exercises you may not have done these are not squats or lunges although those are definitely our top two when it comes to glutes but these two I targeting the glute muscles only so let me show you move number one which is the glute Bridge so what we in the glute bridge I want you to lay down on the floor take your heels pretty close to your body and your hands flat on the ground and I want you to drive through your heels instead of your toes cuz that the glutes so it looks like this up I Want You to Breathe hold hold one second at the top easy down tap and go back up again now one of our expert tips on this is to go ahead and let your knees fall somewhat to the outside because that is going to help with the inward rotation which really helped you target the glutes so just let the knees fall naturally slightly to the sides all right for those of you who are more advanced I want you to add a dumbbell and you can go up to a 15 or 20 or even more if you today I with a 15 pounder this fits nicely right on top of the hips and you hold it with your hands on the two sides and the same move press through your heels and lift to the top so remember don really focus on the muscle tension what you want to do is exhaust your glutes all the way so really use a lot of energy and push your hips as high as you can get okay on to move number two this one is called the Bulgarian lunge and what great about this is as opposed to a regular lunge you further stretch in your glute which is going to help you get a stronger contraction and therefore better results so watch this first you need a platform that then I in front of it what you is lift one leg and place it on top of the bench with your shoelaces down now take your hands over your head and if you this low just about here and up if you take it down like this now what is you in your glute and then what happens is driving through that front heel you getting a really strong contraction through that glute [Music] if you are ready for level three and you further which I know some of you are you dumbbell and we 15 pounder that we just used on the last one I side that move so let I what I hold it on the same side as the working legane so you can directly place the tension where you want it to be and keep your balance so this should be directly next to your hip and you that area thank you for joining me for your how to get a 3D butt tutorial today and I really hope you enjoyed this we really

5 Gym Machines To Avoid for Thighs, Back and Abs (And What Exercises To Do Instead!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asJxEJIOhrU	ATHLEAN - X	hey guys Jess here with athl XX for women I we show you the five machines to never use at the gym don these machines I see women making these mistakes all the time and we really want to help you out and fill you in on which machines are wasting your time and what you can do to get better results faster let go [Music] let machine to avoid this is called the adductor machine and its partner the abductor is right next to it where you put your legs inside and then push outward either way both of these machines are a no no because they really just training your hip flexors so skip these machines they just wasting your time and try this this move Instead This is a side plank leg lift what engages your core your entire body and it stimulates your entire nervous system to get you fit all over instead of just isolating one piece at a time remember there so just because you have fat on your inner or outer thighs does not mean that exercising them will reduce that fat so it tone your inner and outer thighs but just not in isolation now machine number two that you should be avoiding this one is the lower back machine basically same issue as the other one it could be incorporating into your routine with a full body move so why don just skip over this machine this is not necessary and try these variations [Music] instead we like to call these ones superm ground on your belly and then lift your chest and legs off the ground at the same time this is incredible for toning the lower back the same thing that they machine yet what again it engages your whole body and your whole nervous system which is going to get you such a better result in the long run so see I just did a different arm variation with the hands underneath the forehead this makes it a little more challenging and unlike with using that machine you workout at once now if you another level of more challenging more advanced work here is the opposing alternating reaches this is a great one for those of you who are more advanced and looking for a challenge just make sure you don side you want to keep your hips and shoulders facing the ground at all times so these three variations are all better than using that lower back machine moving on to machine number three to avoid this one is called the Ab Coaster and I think that name describes it pretty well if you can you can see what I this exercise without breaking a sweat the problem with this one is that it using too much momentum which is really defeating the purpose of what you trying to achieve remember we to put tension on our muscles not avoid it so try this move Instead This is called a plank knee tuck and I alternating side to side and really pulling that knee towards my nose so notice the spine is going from a flat position to a rounded position that what you move and remember you maximum tension on the muscle so you should really feel each rep move number four is this machine which is kind of an awkward one I really don like it kind of slams at the bottom and the main problem is that you primarily with your arms so again you avoiding tension on your abs rather than placing it on purpose so instead of that one try this one instead basically for all ab movements you doing your exercises on the floor without any equipment there ways to make this more challenging notice this one if I put the legs out this basic crunch becomes really good and challenging and then I can even take it a step further by moving the legs as one straight lever so this is placing tension on the lower abs the upper abs and it want to do focusing on strengthening that core surprise surprise yet another ab machine I bet you see this one I don machine is called but basically you just leaning forward and leaning backwards and you have handlebars with weight the main problem with this move is that you spinal flexion my spine stays straight through the entirety of the movement and I now what about using this move instead when you get the opportunity to round your spine and control your way down and then round it up as you push forward it limiting your range of motion like the machine is doing and you old gravity instead of having to load on a bunch of additional weight the moral of the story today is that all these fancy machines just aren necessary so that I hope you enjoyed this and you learn something from it if you have any questions or comments about what I did in the video today please leave a comment below and remember the program is full of more cool creative moves that are not going to waste your time don waste your time when it comes to your Fitness our time is precious that we designed this program to get everything you do need and nothing that you don amount of time possible so get fit with ice and keep watching this is Jess from athleen XX forom I week	Success

This is your host Jess and today we are working on sculpting those sexy lower abs. Sometimes referred to as the Vcut or in other cases the pooch area. When those muscles start to sag, they can kind of stick out. And today we focusing on moves that can help pull them back in so you can rock a flat stomach. [Music] Here are some of the really important tips when you your abs to get flatter, leaner, and more toned. You all the different muscles that are in there and all the different angles that those muscles work at. So, one of the most important concepts is that we work the abs from the bottom up. So, leg lifts are a really important part of your routine. So, check it out. Today, I favorite versions of leg lifts. Some of them are a little unique and different, but stay tuned till the end to make sure you don exercises. Our first one we start with is called toes to bar or otherwise known as a straight leg lift. And notice that my upper body is in a fixed position while the pelvis is the part that I forward and then controlling the way down. So this is really a bottom up version of an ab exercise. Remember, you can do these anywhere that you can find a bar to hang from. Whether it at home pull-up bar that you can buy at the store or at the gym or at the park like I like to do outside, you can do these anywhere. Okay? And we know some of you are sitting there thinking, way. That move is too advanced for me. Do you have any alternatives or something I can do to work up to that? The answer is yes. Check out this next exercise. This is called knees to nose, and it you it those of you who are not ready for the straight leg version. Again, we have the upper body in a fixed position. Arms and shoulders are not moving, but our goal is to get that pelvis to rock up and forward and then control the way down. Now, unless you pelvis position, you working your hip flexors. I know I hear this complaint a lot that people feel it more in their hip flexors than in their abs. And the key here is actually getting your pelvis position to change. So, notice how far forward my butt comes when I pull those knees in. It important that your spine actually rounds. And then as you come down, it lengthens. Those last two are great moves to get started with your lower abs. But what do we do to really make sure we get that Vcut and make sure we as just from the bottom up? Check out this next move. This one is called oblique knee lifts. And basically, your goal is to shorten the distance between one hipbone and that same side rib cage. So notice that shortening that distance between hip and rib. Now, if that one you, why don This one is called a windshield wiper. And the idea is you go up to one side, but then you rock over the midline to go to the other side. It twist on the oblique knee lift. We hope you far, but we with one crazy exercise that you probably have never seen anywhere else. This is one of my favorites, and I couldn it, so I decided to call it the upside down body fold. Check it out. I think that name describes it pretty well. What do you think? I body in half and then lifting back up into my upside down position. This one really targets and tones those lower abs because in order to get your knees close to your face, you have to squeeze and engage your lower abs. So, that Here in this video today.

BUBBLE BUTT Workout for Women (Build a Round Sexy Booty!!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d6mDcjWgdA	ATHLEAN - X	hey guys welcome back to athlete nextx for women this is Jess I to my workout studio today one of the best exercises every woman needs to be doing squats squats we have a saying in the fitness industry are the difference between having a butt and having an [Music] ass if you want to have a serious shapely round bum then these exercises are exactly what you and every other woman needs to be doing so please share the love if you enjoyed this video share it with someone else who needs to see this let get those bums round everybody is born with a butt that biological structure it glutes are in there but whether they plump and round and firm or kind of flat and pancakey saggy that can make the decision are you going to squat or not squat so if you are ready to get squatting with me I show you my five favorite Advanced variations of squats that I do all the time to keep this thing round and perky we hardest ones first and you want to do this while your legs are fresh because once you you may not be able to do these jump squats so make sure that you do these first in your workout it to also warm up the legs for what we about to do next so you want to find a bench or a platform that High just a regular bench you can find in any gym and what we on top of it and then squat down to a squat position so it looks like this notice how I sure my feet come all the way up onto the bench I see people doing these a lot of times just on the toes but if you really trying to hit the glutes it essential that you are sitting back into your heels so jump fully on top of the bench sit down into the heels into a deep Squat and then just step your way down off okay that let barbell so on the barbell squat as you can see form is super important so I just starting with the bar only and often times I bar so that I can get my form right before adding any weight but you do want to do Progressive weight loading on this so once you squatting with the bar then you to start by adding fives or adding tend just slowly increasing the amount of weight you putting tension on the muscle so that the muscle will will grow and Harden and develop that afraid of muscle muscle is your best friend when it comes to your butt now we squats and front squats are great for hitting the thighs inner outer thighs but it glutes as long as you go low enough so check out this form on my friend BLX the bar is in front of you you going to hold it right under your chin which causes somewhat of a forward lean sometimes so you need to really make sure that you stay upright notice how my eyes kind of go towards the ceiling so that I can make sure I keep good posture and not focus on the floor because that it so you still want to be sitting down and back as if you were sitting into a chair and put most of the pressure in your heels this is essential when you trying to hit the glutes and yes I am going a little bit below 90 but it only because I to where I toes okay so hopefully your glutes are already burning by now but we to do this one that really specifically targets the glutes I you this before but I had to include it in my five favorite variations of squats because as you know this is one of my alltime top squat variations here it paa squat so you want your feet super wide and you the dumbbell and then pull to the top really make sure that you tuck your pelvis under at the top so you can really feel that Squeeze In Your Butt what squat is the pelvic tuck so see at the bottom I kind of stick my butt down and back and then at the top I really make sure to squeeze it and Pull It [Music] Forward so here is the back view you can kind of see what glutes you can see that little extra tighten at the [Music] top [Music] okay for our last booty exercise we going to do the golet squat so I to use the same dumbbell I just had but I like this and take my feet a little bit more narrow and sit back and down like I was sitting in a chair and then lift up to the top so I usually try to line up elbows with knees and then squeeze and [Music] lift and I this demonstration but I really want to encourage you to go heavy use a weight that if it to change you remember challenge equals [Music] change okay okay guys that today variations of challenging Advanced squats for you to try and if you like these squats or if you them before go ahead and leave a comment in the comment section give this video a thumbs up if you want to see more interesting cool and creative moves that are perfect for sculpting the body of your dreams check out the athlete nextx for women workout program it transformation plan from start to finish it you need to do to get in shape we talking meal plan we parts for at home for at the gym DVDs every single thing you could need so make sure you get on board with us join team aing with us and start living strong today this is from ath nextx foran I week	Success

3 Healthy Snacks - The Secret to a SLIM BODY!!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnppI97FYvM	ATHLEAN - X	Jess here with athl XX for I part three of this meal planner series check in the box below for the other two parts today I healthy desserts and healthy protein snacks really high protein really easy to make snacks that take three ingredients or less that you can make ahead of time so you don scramble when it [Music] all you need is three simple ingredients that you might already have come with me let you how to make these three easy snack or dessert recipes first we work on these chocolate peanut butter protein cups these are an amazing like dessert option when you feel like you can absolutely not true you can but it just really matters what the ingredients are so keep it high protein low sugar and get creative with your re recipes good to go so here are the ingredients I going to use first is a protein powder use a chocolate flavor and all natural peanut butter make sure that it one ingredient and the ingredient should be peanuts and lastly a chocolate flavored almond milk so those are our three ingredients let we so that we can make the chocolate into a smooth and creamy consistency now make sure that you find some paper Dixie Cups like this cuz this is what you to use to form the actual peanut butter cup I used about four scoops of protein for this recipe so I that out into four different servings first dump the protein powder into the blender now I little bit of almond milk not too much you can always add more if it thick so now I chocolatey mixture in there let create the first layer which is just the bottom Take My Little Dixie cup here and I really want to be careful here not to put too much it of chocolate so about up to here I going to do that to the rest of the cups and then I butter I would say about a half of a teaspoon and just use my finger to kind to drop it off the edge now I have a little drop of peanut butter right in the middle of my chocolate now what I cover that with another layer thin layer chocolate so I go back to the blender take one more little pour so now my little paper cup is full to about one4 full so you want to keep it really thin just like it was the size of a regular Peanut Butter Cup recipe is done all you do is throw this into the freezer you can make a bunch of these ahead of time if you want make 10 at a time and then you can have them they stay in the freezer as long as you possibly would need them to they in there so you can make a bunch and when you going to do is just tear the paper cup and tear it off the outside and then you have you butter cup okay moving on to recipe number two this is another one that like a dessert but it can be a snack for any time of the day another three ingredient recipe this one is using frozen bananas vanilla way Protein Isolate and our third ingredient H2O instead of regular ice cream that is filled with cream and milk and sugar all the stuff if you want out of your diet we with healthy fruit and protein and water all the best ingredients for your body so let simple first drop all the fruit into the blender dump the um protein on top wait about the water you don this in just yet you want to start blending this mixture before you add any water just to see if it if the bananas are soft enough they might blend without any attic water and then that would give you a thicker consistency of your ice cream start this on a low speed you can see they kind of get stuck there so I need to push down a little bit and like I said don until you see that you need to so you can keep this nice and thick like an ice cream otherwise it turns into a banana smoothie a little more speed just going to add a touch of water done so you can see I really only had to use a tiny Touch of water it wasn so don you need it now using a spoon I to put this in a bowl and then I to put it in the freezer for later use can you see that consistency there it should still be really thick you going to do is put a lid on this you going to stick it in the freezer until it hardens even a little bit more and then you can use an ice cream scooper and get a scoop out of it this is awesome for satisfying that sweet tooth when you just feel like you need to have something nice and sweet after dinner this will not blow your diet and it contribute to getting that protein in that you need and then the healthy fiber from the bananas this is one of my favorite dessert options and like I said it can be used as a snack anytime so definitely try this recipe all right now our third recipe is not necessarily a dessert but like I said you can eat this any time of day that you wish this is what we here I have three eggs that I half so it makes six pieces I be using a fresh and ripe avocado in this case I half of it and our third ingredient is your choice of spice so some people like it hot and some people don like it hot you are going to go with some cayenne pepper if you don hot try some paprika I cayenne pepper today because I like it a little spicy and this is amazing for speeding up that metabolism I need a spoon and a fork for this my first step is to spoon out each of these egg yolks into a separate Bowl our next step is to get that half of an avocado into the same Bowl now I need my fork and this is going to act as a Smasher to mix those two ingredients together mash it until it you this is your healthier alternative instead of using mayonnaise you can try using an avocado which is one of the healthiest fats on planet Earth after lots of smashing and stirring that together this is what it like let make sure that you keep these intact so that they make a nice little cup for us to put this mixture back into just about one teaspoon and it drops right in there there we go so I that mixture back into the egg cups if you wanted to add salt and pepper get a little fancier with your spice combinations you can add anything you like to this maybe even

Agility Tree...X-plosive Quick Foot Drill!!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucHoBr6qlZY	ATHLEAN - X	[Music] Jesus. Huh? [Music] Hey guys, Jeff Cavalier, athletex.com here on a Christmas Eve with a unique workout here for agility. But first of all, I want to wish you all a merry X-Mas. And if you don Christmas, that happy Hanukkah, happy Quanza, whatever it is you guys celebrate. Remember, this is the time of the year to do it. But also know that this is the time when most people slip up. This is when the most damage is done. Adding the most weight that then all of a sudden the resolutions kick in on January 1st and you got a lot to undo. So, I don head start so you can have some momentum going into 2011 so you can get in the best shape of your life. And Athletex is going to help you. And we start with an agility drill. And I going to tell you why it this Christmas tree. First of all, that the pattern is significant in that we are going to follow this lateral agility explosion concept. We with a speed component in the middle and then progressively work on our lateral explosion. So again, speed and explosion, same thing. This is an element of athleticism that yes, you may not be an athlete and you why is it important? because you start to ingrain the ability of your muscle fibers to explode quickly. And when you take that back into the gym, your ability to recruit fast twitch muscle fibers is improved. So this whole, you know, element of athleticism and quick footwork and agility, there specific reason why it belongs in a strength and conditioning program and why it Athletics X. So basically for this sort of Christmas tree drill, and it called the Christmas tree, guys. I getting a little creative here, uh, you know, for the holidays. But it starts with a a high knee component and then a quick lateral hop and hop and back to the center again. Then a little bit further lateral hop and hop and back to the center again. And then bigger lateral hop back to the center. And then as far as you can go and back. Then you work yourself back up the ladder. So basically, here look. Okay? So, you off in the middle. Quick feet up here. Quick feet up. All right. Stick it here. Way over. Way over. Back. Up. Up. Back. Up. Up. Back. Up. Up. Back. Okay. So, you work on just one round of that. You get it gets my heart pumping. But you really want to work on how quick can you get those feet moving. Keep your arms moving with you, okay? In a good arm slot and work on that progressive loading here and unloading and exploding through your lower body. So this you can run through this 10 times in succession. It take about a minute and a half. Very, very difficult to do. But again, that carryover of this explosiveness into your other workouts is going to have an additive effect and allow you to start recruiting more muscle fibers, recruiting them more quickly, increasing your strength, and by doing so now start to get bigger, you know, bigger physique, more muscle, more lean muscle. Guys, if you haven athleenx.com and uh, you know, go give yourself a Christmas present. If no one will buy it for you, buy it yourself. Treat yourself. You thanking me in 2011 as you get into the best shape of your life with Athletics X. Happy holidays, guys. [Music] Huh? Huh? [Music]	Success

This is designed to get you your heart pumping your, you know, your your body accelerated to a whole new pace, burning fat, but obviously at the same time building muscle, preserving muscle because long drawn out cardio is no good. I in between rounds here, we hop the line just like you guys, maybe your wives are doing that at the stores this morning or, god forbid, you guys are out there yourselves, hopping in a line. We to get that extra conditioning benefit in between. So, skier hops times 20 twice plank crossovers to get our upper body because yes, you can do upper body when you I this thing going right here with the bear hug lunges. Again, we this this, you know, 20 lb medicine ball. What I like about it is just got some, you know, some girth to it. You can take a physio ball and do the same thing if you want to add weight to it. Just hold the dumbbell in your hands on the other side. Okay. So, we grab on top of the ball. Just lunge out and twist. Keep the pace a little bit brisk here. And you yourself for this one because we going to try to take it through about three rounds if you can. I I turkey I ate yesterday. So, I don to show you all what it looks like. Put that down over here to the line drills. First one, skier hops again. You get over here, touch, quick touch. About 20 seconds or so. Nice quick feet, soft landing. Remember, you want to look like an athlete, guys. You got to train like one. You got to be quick. Got to be explosive. Okay. Taking it right here into our lying band rows. I athlete elastics band. One hand in, other hand in. Lay back. Okay. Up off the ground a little bit. Don Engage your abs. As you can see, down and pull. 12 or 15 on those. Coming up back to the line. No rest. Get it going. about 20 seconds. Next, we the abs. Plank variation with a little crossover symmetry right over here. I one looks like. Pretty pretty intense, pretty unique. Get up in a plank position on top. Now you touch work on one side at a time. Right knee, left elbow 10 times. In and then out. In. Out. Now we switch it up. Right. And across. Okay. Right. gets real difficult especially after the other ones. All right, you work the other side too over here. Now, we were just working the upper body. Let line drills. I can see what I using our upper body. So, hands down and you here. Just place your hands right hand, left hand, left hand, right hand. Try to get a little rhythm going. [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] Okay. Triceps, upper body, chest, everything. Back over here. Cobra push-ups. So, you transition from lower body, upper body, swoop down, swoop up. Okay. Butt high. Swoop down and up. Back and through. Okay. Down, up, back. Now let me break it down for you one time on that. Basically three different areas here. Shoulders, eentric shoulders all the way down. Swoop triceps to press up back down. chest eentrically, shoulders and upper chest on the way up. Okay, back over to the line down fast. Okay, last one. Bring it home. Alternate kettle bell swing. Oh, this is tough, guys. I rather be out shopping. Down, swing, and up. Switch to grip. Little athleticism involved, coordination, that total body explosive movement. Welcome to Black Friday, guys. Um, like I said, in Athleene X burst conditioning, we don get on a treadmill and walk on what I call the the road to nowhere for 40 minutes, 45 minutes. I can how many people probably hit the gym today with that being their focus to try to make up from yesterday. So, don that, guys.
