Endometriosis: Causes, Symptoms & Link With Iodine Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yINSNtpCX2Q	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hi it we called endometriosis okay what is this it body where you have extra tissue that growing outside the uterus or on the fallopian tubes around the ovaries it causing pain inflammation infertility all sorts of problems with the menstrual cycle now if you type this up and try to find the cause it unknown cause but the the female reproductive tissue is very highly sensitive to hormones specifically estrogen this is an estrogen dominant problem it everything that you do needs to be in the area of lowering the estrogen naturally there to recommend number one your diet must be organic both in the area of meats and cheeses as well as vegetables why because the chemicals that they spray on the vegetables the stuff that they feed the animals has GMO and they have pesticides insecticides and all that stuff mimics estrogen okay the other thing this is a side note you definitely want to cut down the sugars too because sugar can greatly exaggerate the production of estrogen number two cruciferous vegetables why because the cruciferous vegetables like kale and broccoli and Brussels sprouts and bok choy all are anti osteogenic they they don what they do is they lower the bad and they increase the good so they help balance estrogen so there concentrated type of cruciferous called dim you can look do some research into that number three iodine this is very very important I like to recommend this source of iodine from sea kelp a really good organic sea kelp you want it from a clean ocean but iodine decreases estrogen in the receptor cells so it dominance it the ovary fibrocystic breast menstrual cycle estrogen dominance so this one really really key and sometimes you have to increase it a little bit more that than what so the only time you wouldn iodine is if you have a hyper thyroid condition okay other than that you can take it make sure it because it tends to wake you up and it gives you energy and you don have that affect your sleep all right go ahead and apply these three things and let me know how you do thanks for watching hey if you finding out the underlying cause of your body issues click the link below and take the evaluation quiz	Success

How To Get Rid Of Wrinkles? Â Dr. Berg? on Collagen Peptides	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBRqSUEbndo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys in this video we about how to unwrinkle your wrinkles okay so there fixing it from the outside and using creams and lotions and rubbing in your face and trying to get rid of wrinkles the other concept is from the inside out where you come from within and then come out and I like this approach a lot better than trying to use some external thing that you the anti-wrinkle creams use something called retinol that is a synthetic vitamin A ok so vitamin A is really important with the skin especially for acne scarring and just really beautiful skin some of the dry skin problems that you see out there are it person is dehydrated it missing certain healthy fats so if we go over here and talk about what fats that would be good that would provide by them an a egg yolks are at the top the list okay so you don egg whites you want the hoax especially butter grass-fed butter very important cod liver oil virgin cod liver oil would be a really good vitamin A and vitamin D complex to help get those essential nutrients these are fat soluble nutrients I would also consume the vitamin A in vegetables but just realize when you do that you and they vitamin A is carotenoids active vitamin A is retinol however there benefits of consuming the pre vitamin A complexes and additional phytonutrients to help your skin protective factors great for growing healthy skin and one of the things like to do is mix these two together I don because it tends to increase oxalates and it can lead to stones but kale and parsley are awesome to mix together where you could blend those in a shake put some blueberries fill it up with water and consume that as your final nutrients that would really help your skin and I would recommend collagen peptides as your raw material to build healthy skin I use a brand called Vita protein which is grass-fed pasture raised from Brazil high quality stuff now on the flip side you also want to avoid things okay so you avoiding certain things a couple things that will really destroy your skin is high levels of insulin so you have to lower that if you have a pre-diabetic situation or you have insulin resistance which most people do you can in the body you can so that is a problem especially with aging skin so just by fixing this alone your skin will really be youthful and the way to do it is by cutting up the sugar do the keto and especially the intermittent fasting and you watching my videos you know why because in termina fasting will stimulate something called a tapa g which is a recycling effect of yourself clearing out the old damaged parts renewing the cells renewing the skin just that alone will give you a really nice layer of skin okay so you want an intimate fasting cut the sugar out do keto and also reduce cortisol cortisol is a stress hormone it destroys the skin it turns the protein in the skin into sugar and it gives you a lot of sagging skin and collagen so of course to do that you walks and try to reduce the stress as much as possible the last factor is this thing called bile bile the stuff in your gallbladder it dissolve the grease and the fats that you eat it extract vitamin A and vitamin E and the other fat side of atamans from the fat that you eat and if you don enough bile consuming vitamin A products just won you have enough bile well here things if you don you have a congested gallbladder let you need some help with the bow if you have a fatty liver chances are you probably don symptoms that would indicate low bile would be burping belching bloating right shoulder pain pain in the upper trap here those are all symptoms gall bladder in liver so one of things I recommend for that situation would be gall bladder formula it doesn have purified bile salts it has enzymes for the pancreas it has enzymes for the stomach it helps the bile be thinned and it helps you extract these fat soluble vitamins from your food and into the skin all right thanks for watching hey before you go definitely sign up for my free keto course I put a link down below it will give you all the basics it quick it it	Success

The Cause of Heart Palpitations Â Dr. Berg on Insulin Resistance & Electrolytes Deficiency	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CIOc-GVnt4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so wanted to do a video in palpitations it there and all of a sudden the heart skips or they get this sudden extra pounding of the heart or elevated heart rate and they with my heart it can be pretty scary but palpitations are a problem with the rhythm of the heart and what controls the rhythm are electrolytes okay that would be like potassium magnesium sodium and calcium so palpitations really are a deficiency of these electrolytes so either you vegetables for example to get your electrolytes or you these electrolytes and there two reasons for that one is you have insulin resistance now again you videos the key to open up the cellular door it purposes of insulin is to help you absorb minerals into the cell insulin resistance is a situation where it doesn door so you become deficient in these minerals so insulin resistance is a common cause for heart palpitations because you electrolytes so even one of the symptoms of diabetes is palpitations simply because of the insulin resistance and the blocking of absorption of these electrolytes now one more cause and that would be low stomach acids because it takes certain acids to absorb the minerals and that why if you even look up in Merck manual for example one of the medical books of one of the side effects from people with acid reflux and GERD is palpitations why because you don the pH the acidity to absorb these electrolytes which control the rhythm alright thanks for watching hey if you underlying cause of your body issues click the link below and take the evaluation quiz	Success

Intense Withdrawal Symptoms & Headaches on Keto Adaptation Â Dr. Berg's Keto Tips	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSJ4Nqi7PYg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys I gonna talk about headaches and key to adaptation okay now in some of the other videos I talked about the transition from sugar burning to ketosis or fat burning requires certain nutrients like B vitamins and potassium right some people take these vitamins but they don about why that could be there reason and it symptoms because if you have been consuming breads pasta cereal whatever for a long period of time or junk foods or just sugar and you come off them it it like coming off coffee or coming off alcohol and what happens is there neurotransmitter in your brain called dopamine and when you have a dopamine deficiency that start feeling these weird symptoms right here and one big one is headaches so there recommend number one slowly start increasing a little bit more carb okay maybe like five grams at a time until these symptoms go away because a lot of people really suffer not just with headaches with they just feel really funky and number two you can take something called phenyl alanine which is a natural amino acid which will then help build up more dopamine in the system so then there withdrawal symptoms okay so I pointing this out as another reason why you may have headaches or other symptoms that go beyond just the key to adaptation alright thanks for watching so we stories but I don story yet so click the link down below and upload you before and after I want to actually hear about your success story I want to see your before-and-afters and every week we do featured success stories so click the link down below and share your success	Success

Fibromyalgia on the Right Side of Your Body Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjHrwNlI7Q8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hi guys today we something called right-sided fibromyalgia now what is that well in the last thirty years of practice I noticed the majority of clients coming in with fibromyalgia nearly always had it on the right side okay now why was that that was weird why would you have it just on the right side and not the left side okay well I found when I started pulling the string that the real cause for this condition is the gallbladder which has happens to be on the right side now there little nerve that comes right here called the phrenic nerve that can refer pain to the right shoulder to the neck all the way up on the right side and it can even affect your meridians like in Chinese medicine there channels called meridians and that can affect the entire right side even lower on the leg as well so anything on the right side you always want to check the gallbladder so if you have right-sided pain right now do this simple experiment take your hand press underneath the right ribcage about an inch down an inch from the midline and just start massaging that for about a minute and you will soon find out that that pain completely goes away why because the root problem is the gallbladder okay if you research from algae you find they don an unknown cause they don fix it but check the gallbladder okay now the question is now what would a great the gallbladder number one frequent eating like eating six meals a day snacking continually why because it keeps aggravating the digestive system it has to constantly work that going an imminent fasting is incredible for improving gallbladder function because you the gallbladder number two consuming nuts can aggravate the gallbladder okay and make you feel bloated too much sugar refined grains or even whole grains cortisol de that prednisone and medication or just stress can aggravate the gallbladder high levels of estrogen can aggravate the gallbladder and cause stones whether you replacement therapy or just got pregnant that can do it too low fat diets cannot she creates tones consuming saturated fats actually stimulate the release of bile that actually prevents gulf stones okay and that low fat diet you can end up with gall stones so a low fat diet can cause the stones in the gallbladder but a high fat diet can also aggravate the gall butter but not necessarily create the stone and that tend to stimulate the gallbladder to release more and more bile but there higher risk factor for gall bladder disease for diabetics simply because sugar aggravates the gallbladder so if you look at some of the remedies for fibromyalgia which is an inflammatory condition in your muscles and connective tissue you remedy that seems to be effective called malic acid okay now why would malic acid help fibromyalgia because it supports the gallbladder it helps soften stones it increases the bile duct it vasodilate s-- the little duct allow the sludge from the gallbladder to drain out it the compound then it and take a while guess where you can find malic acid in apple cider vinegar another great remedy for fibromyalgia because it supports the gallbladder in the liver so if you have a gall bladder problem apple cider vinegar is what you need to do infrequent eating that called in a minute fasting you need to do keto adjust the fats to your tolerance you may need to take some purified bile salts okay I put a link down below for more information about that especially if you don bladder because you don bile to break down the fats or choline is another thing you can take to support the breakdown of fats and it really good for a fatty liver so I believe that fibromyalgia is really a secondary condition a symptom of a congested gall bladder thanks for watching hey I appreciate your attention and if you and subscribe and I will definitely keep you updated on future events live events and webinars that we soon	Success
Causes of Ammonia Body Odor on Keto Diet Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9Wyya44MD8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys had another question from someone that wanted to know what is the ammonia smell coming from my body okay doing keto in a minute fasting and I have this interesting odor coming out so let ammonia is the byproduct of protein breakdown it which is the breakdown of protein and in a normal person with normal healthy kidneys this ammonia should break down into something called urea and be excreted okay urea is a a less toxic material ammonia is more toxic especially to the brain and the nervous system so if your kidneys are normal okay you can make this conversion very easily and there the ammonia builds up in the body it can create not just an odor coming out of your skin but problems with your mint your cognitive function lethargy being irritable seizures breathing problems and even brain swelling it could be quite dangerous okay so that what do we do about it well to figure that out we have to know what causes this buildup of ammonia there things number one either a fatty liver or a liver that has cirrhosis that scar tissue because the capacity of liver to function and detoxify this is not there there by backing it up to the system into the blood creating all sorts of issues kidney damage okay so if you have kidney damage or liver damage you can actually easily get a buildup of ammonia okay number three acidosis some people get acidosis when they do the ketogenic plan if they don correctly because they something called vegetables vegetables counter the acidity from ketones now when your potassium deficient it can start producing and excreting large amounts of ammonia hmm I wonder what food will increase potassium certain side effects for medication and drinking a lot of alcohol will also affect ammonia probably because medication and alcohol destroy the liver and the kidneys and lastly a high protein diet now if you have healthy kidneys and a healthy liver you could probably handle higher amounts of protein so if you start noticing that your body starts having this odor of ammonia could be the liver it could be the kidney it could be that you vegetables or getting enough potassium or your protein is just too high so if you Share and spread the word	Success

How To Trigger Vagus Nerve? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dtPN4xrY4U	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys in this video we about how to trigger or stimulate something called the vagus nerve now what does the vagus nerve it the longest nerves in the body it originates from the brainstem on both sides okay and it goes throughout the whole thorax or the the the chest and the abdomen intervening the heart the digestive organs the spleen and it has a two-way street in other words information can be picked up from the digestion and sent back up to the brain and an information from the brain can be sent down there so if there lies down here it can really affect you up here okay that know if you are bloated or you feel constipated you just don your your your brain fog you have a headache things like that so the vagus nerve is part of something called the parasympathetic nervous system now the parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for rest and digest so digestion rest recovery things like that and then you have the sympathetic nervous system which is flight-or-fight picture being chased by a tiger running away you need high pulse rate you need blood flow to your muscles adrenalin then when you sleep you need the parasympathetic so you need both of these working in harmony now the problem most people is that they nervous system because of stress and very weak on the parasympathetic nervous system now if you can picture this let say for example you run up a stairs right and your pulse rate goes up as soon as you get to the top and you stop running up the stairs the parasympathetic nervous system kicks in and is activated and it of a picture it like a wave it push down wave that it actively your pulse rate down so after exercise the parasympathetic nervous system kicks in there and is the recovery mechanism so if you have poor recovery you really have a weakened parasympathetic nervous system some of them has a really good recovery they can bounce back quick they have a very strong parasympathetic nervous system but a problem with this system can really affect your not just recovery but your ability to sleep heal it can create all sorts of problems in the digestive system and fortunately certain drug companies are starting to develop something called electro suit achill devices for example here which they basically put a little device on your chest and they stimulate through little mini shocks the vagus nerve to help people with migraines headaches fibromyalgia inflammation Crohn depression epilepsy and the list goes on and on but that there effectiveness isn going to show you four things that you can do to strengthen the vagus nerve and really the parasympathetic nervous system okay number one simple breathing you can control your own breathing okay consciously and affect the parasympathetic nervous system because when you breathing is altered usually it you breathing out very shallow so the breathe the exhalation is very shallow so it stressed so if you night for example and you can you want to just calm your nervous system down this is what you would do you would slowly breathe in for four to five seconds and then slowly breathe out for four to five seconds so right before bed you like you having your exhalation is exactly the same is your inhalation at about four to five seconds okay that over a period of a few minutes is going to calm down the nervous system and you fall asleep pretty quick so this is a great technique right here okay number two long walks calm the nervous system down it will stimulate the parasympathetic number three there are certain minerals that also support the parasympathetic nervous system and the big one is potassium because it magnesium and sodium so just make sure your diet includes enough of these minerals and in the ketogenic plan it built around supplying these minerals right here and including some sea salt as well on the flipside if you look at the sympathetic nervous system you need phosphorous okay and also calcium so phosphorus you would get from animal meats so if you protein for example not enough vegetable you can that alone can stimulate the sympathetic nervous system so we want a balance of a good amount of vegetables to provide the potassium in magnesium and some meats to help balance that out and lastly there acupressure techniques that you can do to greatly improve the parasympathetic recovery and also kind of turn off your sympathetic nervous system I put a link down below if you haven I did a whole webinar it stress webinar and actually walk you through how to do this step by step all right so go ahead and apply this and I will see you in the next video so if you don want to check it out it not lose weight to get healthy it healthy to lose the weight healthy ketosis and in a minute fasting check it out I put a link down below	Success

What Is Autonomic Neuropathy? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqVFAIP6kFI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys in this video we about another part of the nervous system that gets affected with high blood glucose or high insulin okay in other videos I the brain your memory your cognitive function I talked about peripheral neuropathy which is damage to the nerves in the hands and the feet because high levels of insulin and high levels of sugar destroy the blood vessels that go to the nerves but the autonomic nervous system is another part of the nervous system that is not commonly talked about okay the autonomic nervous system is composed of three different sections you have the sympathetic nerves which is the flight-or-fight you have the parasympathetic nervous system which is responsible for rest and digest and recovering from stress and then you also have the part which is called the enteric which is all the digestion so the autonomic nervous system is that system that works below your conscious awareness it works on automatic so when you have a neuropathy nerve damage of this system you can have a problem with the bladder retention lack of control where you have to wear a diaper leaky valves your genitals could be also affected in potency you can don there where your stomach just doesn very fast so everything is very slow of course if you have a slow digestive system you constipation because you the full digestion and then you have problems with the heart blood pressure either high or low pulse rate either high or low or rhythm problems like atrial fibrillation or heart palpitations you can also have problems with breathing in oxygen exchange as in sleep apnea so the consequence of high sugar and high insulin on the nervous system is quite extensive but the good news about this is that if you can control the sugar and you can lower the insulin you can heal some of these disorders I over the place when you put people on a healthy ketogenic diet and in the minute fasting you see amazing things clear up that you wouldn up you see bladder and prevent improvements with the sex organs great improvements with digestion cardiovascular and the quality of sleep so just because you have these conditions does not mean it permanent so I put a link down below for those of you that are new to this you definitely need to look into the area of keto and in a min the fasting hey if you enjoyed this video press subscribe and I will definitely keep you updated	Success
Should I Avoid Seeds & Nuts with Diverticulitis? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMShcbfWIn8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I had another question should I avoid seeds and nuts if I have diverticulitis okay well first of all what does diverticulitis it inflammation in your diverticula which are little use these little pouches and your colon and this idea that if you consume seeds or nuts they kind of lodge in there and irritate it and create more problem that is a total myth see the nuts do not create inflammation in your colon okay they don diverticulitis comes from consuming foods that are very inflammatory like the grains like the bread the pasta the cereal the crackers those foods vegetable oils like corn and soy oil and your salad dressing highly inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids of course sugar is very inflammatory if you have insulin resistance you inflammation so just by getting on keto and doing in a minute fasting especially you can heal the inflammation in your colon 95% of people that have this have it in the lower part of the colon the last part called a sigmoid colon it the left lower area right here and some foods that are really crucial would be all the leafy greens which have chlorophyll chlorophyll is a great healer of the colon wheatgrass juice powder also really will help cabbage any form of cabbage whether it or just regular coleslaw or cabbage has certain things in there that are really good for the colon okay it acid reflux as well fermented vegetables are really important like pickles sauerkraut kimchi really important to provide the right food for the microbes that will also help you because a lot of times this condition happens after you take antibiotics you wipe out all the good bacteria and then you have all these inflammatory conditions so you have to build that back up alright thanks for watching hey some curious comment below and tell me what you think about this video	Success
Tinnitus \"Ringing in the Ears\" is an Insulin Problem Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cbylubjzhhg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys in this video we about tinnitus another mechanism of what causes it okay now the inner ear and the brain have no glycogen storage unit in other words both areas are dependent on the sugar in the blood okay so that one thing and when you have high levels of sugar and high levels of insulin insulin really comes first and then high levels of sugar become a diabetic what happens there that get destroyed one is the kidney one is the brain when as a heart and one of the nervous system that peripheral neuropathy your fingers and your toes you start getting numbness and tingling and then eventually it starts to creating problems with the vascular system so there things that happen so when you have high sugar high insulin what happens that tends to deplete nutrients in the tissues specifically B vitamins b1 okay and then you start having all these symptoms okay so there studies I below of the relationship between tinnitus which is basically destruction of the nerves in the inner ear in creating this ringing sensation which drives people crazy I believe it the high sugar that destruction of the nerves so if it going to affect the brain which it does it well another study showed that eighty four percent of people with tinnitus had high levels of insulin but they never check for insulin doctors never check for a fasting insulin test so if you have tinnitus ask your doctor to test the insulin levels okay and see if it high so now what do we do about it I gonna recommend doing two things one is to go out and find a good source of fat soluble B vitamin called benfotiamine okay benfotiamine you can get it online or at the health of store but it is a an amazing fat soluble vitamin that innervates the nerves to help heal the nerves from high sugar or high insulin the damage from these two secondly you need to do healthy ketosis in a minute fasting that problem right here so you can then restore it but you definitely are going to need the benfotiamine to actually speed up the process alright thanks for watching hey I appreciate your attention and if you ahead and subscribe and I will definitely keep you updated on future events live events and webinars that we	Success

Hot Flashes: Causes, Signs & Remedies Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6BukNCtJiU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	okay so in this video we about hot flashes in the mechanism behind a hot flash okay I videos on this but there are older videos and I wanted to do something updated the medical term for a hot flash would be vasomotor instability and what this means is there instability in the feedback loops between the hypothalamus and the ovaries okay and it creates a flushing response they call a superficial vasodilation and a deep drop in core temperature every four minutes so it and you can get palpitations and perspiration problems with the heart etc okay it wakes you up when you so a woman normally has about 400 eggs that are released each month okay in theory they each month sometimes if you control pills it but you have a certain amount of eggs then the last one you release and you go into menopause roughly about age 52 so at this point you don of hormones okay because you going to have babies so what happens the signal comes back up here and kicks in another circuit for the adrenals because the adrenal gland produces the same hormones in smaller amounts but still it produces the same hormone so the adrenal glands are the back up to the ovaries so really it adrenal glands that triggers this instability and causes these symptoms now if a woman takes form on a placement therapy it will completely get rid of this hot flashes because what you doing is you you artificially okay and temporarily so the actual trigger to the hot flash in the first place is the weakness of the adrenal that decrease in estrogen that then if you actually add the estrogen back in there it just turns off okay so now that pretty much the mechanism but now what do we do about it okay there is various natural things that you can take to support this like black cohosh but I adrenal glands okay because that is the thing that really created the problem in the first place and I down below of a bunch of things you can do to support a healthy adrenal gland okay but black cohosh is a really good one to to actually supply some phytoestrogens to help complete the circuit if you need something stronger I which has a different blend of herbs and something called dim which actually helps balance estrogen too and if it really really bad I recommend something even stronger it fatigue formula this is my strongest adrenal fatigue normally you won this but on a rare occasion if there real big problem with hot flashes I would do a combination of these two right here because this one can support a healthy adrenal gland and complete this circuit right there so in summary hot flashes are purely a communication problem because the adrenal glands have not backed up the ovaries properly and this is the area to support right here and the other thing that I want to mention is when you take hormone replacement therapy there side effects so I try to do this as natural as possible to avoid those okay alright thanks for watching hey guys so I of a future video and I wanted to find out what your biggest body problem is so that way the content is aligning with something that you are personally interested in so please click the link down below fill it out and I will create the video thanks	Success

Try This For Your Autoimmune Disorder/ Disease Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVU4NTP1Isg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys someone had a question about autoimmune what was my thoughts on autoimmune conditions and I want to talk to you about that in this video there a guy named dr. Roy Lee famous nutritionist back in the 20s 30s 40s and 50s I think he died in 1963 okay but he was heavily attacked by the FDA and the whole thing it but he had a lot of amazing nutritional discoveries and one was something called a PMG which is stands for proto morphogen and it actually works on autoimmune okay so in this example let just take the thyroid gland we have the thyroid and the body antibodies which mean against the body against its own tissue so it attack so an autoimmune disease or condition is it condition where your body is attacking itself kind of crazy but that situation where it becomes inflamed and it just stays inflamed and you can heal it doesn your immune system is attacking itself so he had a brilliant idea and I like this idea he said if you take an extract the DNA from another species like a let took the DNA from a Kyl thyroid and we extracted it so what he did he took the cells from another species and he found a way of extracting the DNA using sea salt okay because you sea salts will cause it to burst he takes out the DNA material and he dehydrates it okay so he found that the DNA from this thyroid is similar to ours okay I don it and then if you take this PMG say this thyroid extract into your stomach what happens is your antibodies that are attacking the thyroid go to this decoy and leave your thyroid alone okay this was the whole strategy and theory of basically giving the body a decoy to divert the attention of the immune system to let the thyroid then heal because it you can deplete this antibody Reserve that have any destructive attacks on the thyroid so there there that sell glandular extracts for different organs like the adrenal like the thyroid like the lung and obviously if you have the glandular extract you have DNA in it so the whole idea would be to take the extract of a certain tissue that you have antibodies attacking take it orally to give your body a decoy left the organs heal to the point where you no longer have an autoimmune problem so this is really a problem with the immune system because it allergy to its own tissues so if you were to have an autoimmune of the thyroid and someone injected you with thyroid extract you would have a serious anaphylactic shock you would actually have a massive allergy and you could possibly die but dr. Roy Lee found that when you take it orally it goes through the immigration process properly so it gets the stamp of approval before it goes in the body okay because you have this whole lymphatic like like barrier here and you don have that reaction other than and maybe a real mild spike in histamines which will create maybe a little fatigue in which case you would just want to take this before bed so some of the companies that sell PM G are not going to make any claims and I not going to make any claims so what I going to recommend is if you have an autoimmune condition you may want to try this out to see if it can help you search out and I specific brands but you can search out either PM G or a glandular extract that you can take small amounts over a long period of time take take them before bed to see if it can help you so thanks for watching and put your comments below so I want to know what you video click the link down below and share some ideas I want to hear	Success
Toxic Effects of Iron Overload Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brCfMBQ9LPU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys in this video we talk about the toxic effect from iron which is in a lot of grains which I know you people who do so what they do with grains like breads pasta cereal they fortify them and the United States Canada and Britain in other countries but not a lot of the European countries but anyway if you too much iron it could be a big problem for several reasons number one iron is attracted to damaged tissue in the body so if you have high levels of insulin and you have inflammation and you have insulin resistance and you have problems with the heart the brain the kidneys for example the nervous system well iron goes into those areas and it oxidizes the tissues which kind of rusts them out it just rots them out just like in your car you have this rust so it accident is including the fat layer around the nervous system and the brain as well so these metals accumulate without the ability to get rid of them so the problem with excess iron is you can only get rid of like 1.2 milligrams a day yet people are getting massive quantities on a daily basis so it going to the liver and other tissues the RDAs or the required amounts that we need to prevent a deficiency would be 8 milligrams and we do need some iron food-based but we don it but a lot of the supplements have like 18 milligrams 22 milligrams way too high and they anemia and things like that but I recommend solving anemia with just red meat or other proteins that will have the natural type of iron in them number 6 all microbes need iron to survive those are good bacteria and microbes and pathogens they live on iron so when your body has an infection it actually will start to regulate iron in not the release of iron from the tissues to try to help the immune system work better and this is why probiotics are so important because if you have more good bacteria which will eat more of this iron this excess it leaves less for the pathogens so if you know people of course not yourself because you no grain diet if you know people that have excess iron one of the best ways to eliminate the iron it with these this mineral and pulling it out is called phytic acid okay and the type of phytic acid i recommend is ip6 it phosphate which is basically one inositol which is in the family of the B vitamins and six phosphates connected it prevent the rusting effect of iron so it will actually help neutralize the damaged effects of iron and allow it to go through the body so it inhibits oxidation from iron and it one of probably the most powerful key leaders for iron and one last point I want to bring up you can get a lot of excess iron if you quantities of meats okay and other animal proteins if you enough vegetable and other foods that can actually cause a buildup of iron - because where do we get phytic acid from the vegetables from the nuts from the seats another reason why you need to consume a lot of vegetables with your animal protein alright thanks for watching hey I appreciate your attention and if you and subscribe and I will definitely keep you updated on future events live events and webinars that we soon	Success

The Great Remedy to Prevent Kidney Stones Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0O0s37hO_eQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys have another video for you on kidney stones a really really good remedy if you stones or if you have a stone this is what I would recommend is called ip6 it which is a type of B vitamin and phosphorus and this compound is really something called phytic acid so this compound has the capacity to prevent the crystallization of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate now it does a lot of other things and I video specifically on this because it quite amazing but I down below of what it can do for actual kidney stones now in addition to this I low carb diet simply because high amounts of carbohydrates in the diet can increase stone formation a moderate amount of protein okay we don much we just want moderate large amounts of vegetables and this also will give you more phytic acid okay which will help so you want to avoid spinach chocolate and peanuts which are high in oxalates and vitamin C now there conflicting data and vitamin C in the formation of kidney stone but vitamin C binds with calcium preventing the calcium from forming with oxalates okay so I want to research even more on that but it cause a kidney stone okay vitamin C will help prevent a kidney stone and increase your fluids now again within reason drink more than you would normally but don also you can add electrolytes especially if you more fluids because when you there and you fluids things can settle in grow if the environment is just right but if you do all of these things I think it you lemon water would be very very beneficial because lemon will help counter some of these formations of the oxalate stones vitamin b6 which you can get in just a healthy diet is very important in preventing stone formation and increase calcium foods like in grass-fed dairy now you would think consuming more calcium would end up with more stone but it dietary calcium through your digestive system well you your kidney very counterintuitive but it calcium I take it as a supplement would be something called calcium or at 8 now another interesting phenomena that occurs right before someone as a kidney stone is many times they in their calf like they toe on one leg and just it cramping up like crazy sometimes the way come out of bed so one of the theories that I have on why you might get that cramping is because it deficiency it could be a magnesium deficiency but it deficiency because when one part of the body is deficient in calcium the other part tends to retain it as a stone in your kidney and then we have magnesium which is very important to counter a kidney oxalate stone but if you consuming a lot of vegetables you getting all your magnesium alright so there you have it so go ahead and comment below and tell me what you think hey guys I had a quick question I thinking about doing a keto summit in Washington do you see this fall and the reason I want to do in the fall that my favorite time of the year where the leaves are falling it gorgeous in Washington DC and I wanted to know if you would be interested in coming out so this will have a chance to meet you and cover the entire subject of keto and in a minute fasting so I haven formulated all the details yet but I just wanted to find out if you interested I put a link down below let me know	Success

Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDPaoQA53XQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys in this video we talk about the two causes of tingling and numbness in your hands and feet number one it that usually occurs from consuming a lot of refined carbohydrates and sugars usually when someone the actual diabetic they have a b1 deficiency in which case you want to consume the type of b1 that is fat soluble because normally be want is water-soluble and the reason for that is you want to penetrate the fat layer around the nervous system because that all the nerves have this insulation around them called myelin so this is the form of b1 that you called benfotiamine okay so you take that and if you have very severe symptoms take more like you would take 4 per day spread out if you have mild symptoms you just take one per day so that of this this symptom would be a calcium deficiency okay in which case you to take this form calcium aspartate and hydrous okay why because this form of calcium absorbs like 98% whereas other forms of calcium only absorb between five and twenty percent so this goes in like a rocket ship it really helps you but then the question is how do you know if you have a b1 deficiency or a calcium deficiency well let b1 deficiencies you you increase heart rate you might even have tenderness when you press into your calf restless leg syndrome nightmares okay and there deficiency will create cramps in your legs and even the back of the hand like the hamstring area weak nails fatigue spasm in your larynx okay so you might have this chronic cough or this tightness in the back of your throat a lowered mood so you might be depressed or have anxiety osteoporosis twitches and black and blue spots okay so basically just narrow down which one you have and you can take this one or this one to actually help yourself with this so most likely it deficiency in which case you definitely need to change your diet do keto inman and fasting but sometimes this doesn work because you deficiency alright thanks for watching so I hope you Health Summit coming up in October so I want to quickly comment on what we gonna do that conventions okay the problem with these other conventions is they give you information over a load okay it much data that you in a sea of information we do things very differently we going to cover the most important things that make a huge difference now there are three very powerful strategies that we summit that you will not find and any of my youtube videos number one is on memory I something very cool to dramatically increase your memory and concentration that two I increase your stress tolerance so you are completely calm all the time alright and number three and most importantly if you have a slow metabolism if you everything is kind of just really slow I complete control over your metabolism so you can literally turn up the dial as high as you want and control as much weight as you want to lose and these three things are just a tiny bit of what you click the link below get signed up and I will see you in October	Success
Stop Rusting Out Your Brain! Iron Supplements & Iron Overload Causes Brain Damage Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RngQ-xmYRN8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys today we how to avoid rusting out your brain okay so I was reading this UCLA study on the iron accumulation connection to Alzheimer I that makes sense because we know too much iron in the body is very dangerous to the mitochondria to the cells creates a lot of damage it can lead to cancer so when you combine free iron with oxygen you form a very powerful free radical that can damage the fat layer that surrounds the nervous system the myelin and it can just break that down in the body you want all the iron to be formed with a protein like in your blood for example you have it connected with a protein but we don we don can create a lot of problems so iron can then destroy certain parts of the brain specifically the hippocampus which then can lead to dementia but it accumulation of iron and having free iron in the body that creates the problem so then my question is where are we getting this excess iron two places one is supplementation some of the top main vitamin companies use the wrong type of iron in their ingredients okay so I I why don what you think okay but it would get from G and C or the drugstore they pick up the bottle and they heavy because they have a ton of calcium carbonate and they have metals and that synthetic vitamins very cheap to make but they are loaded with the wrong type of iron okay so if you supplement just make sure it based if your parents are buying supplements or your grandparents look in their cupboard and make sure it comes from actual food just read the ingredients and see what it if it doesn replace it with some higher quality supplement number two the fortification of foods primarily grains the enriching with the synthetic B vitamins and the iron that exposed so of course if you going to be consuming grains so you have nothing to worry about but you know your parents your grandparents could unknowingly be consuming excess iron from the fortification of foods so check out the link below and if you do have problems with Alzheimer dementia and you find you have accumulation of iron in the body the question is how do you get it out I would recommend taking something like a key later which basically naturally combines with iron and pulls it out safely the best natural key later is phytic acid in the form of ip6 okay you can get this from the health of store I don ip6 and this is what you to help neutralize iron and get it out of the body safely so we can actually protect ourselves against excess iron thanks for watching so we getting a lot of success stories but I don click the link down below and upload you before and after I want to actually hear about your success story I want to see your before-and-afters and every week we do featured success stories so click the link down below and share your success	Success

Hidden Deficiency in POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84lRoZKMte8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we hidden deficiency in a condition named Potts okay that stands for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome okay this is a condition which involves the inability to tolerate different positions so let up too fast or just even gets up in general and they have to sit down or they get up and they have this huge spike and pull straight like 30 points okay there with a system called the autonomic nervous system so this condition is a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system that is in the background that not working correctly there other associated symptoms connected to this dizziness fatigue pain fibromyalgia neurological tingling in the feet and the hands anxiety depression and many many more so basically if you do research on this you complex it knows what to do about it they take this there but if you take a look at another condition called berry berry the symptoms are very very similar berry berry is that vitamin b1 deficiency as a deficiency of thymine thymine is intimately involved in autonomic nervous system function in other words it key player in the normal function of the autonomic nervous system both the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system and if you look up a lot of the symptoms from Barry Barry you this pretty close so the way you would become deficient in vitamin b1 would be many different things consuming a lot of refined sugars and carbohydrates and going through stress I mean the stress could be anything anything that would shock the system but specifically stresses that can deplete a vitamin b1 1 being vaccinations there between being vaccinated and ending up with this condition I think because it will deplete your b1 either from having a heavy metal toxicity which can affect that or some type of immune response now the other thing is that a lot of times doctors don deficiencies right they some classic berry berry deficiency like waiting till you get every single symptom as compared to maybe a slight version of this deficiency that shows some of the characteristics of having a b1 deficiency there could do is called wreath recite trance Kido lace which is a great test to determine if it deficiency because this measures the function of b1 in your body now it really actually difficult to find a lab to do this test a much easier thing to do is just to take b1 and see if this condition improves I would also recommend taking in addition to higher amounts of b1 take nutritional yeast because that way you have all the B vitamins there to prevent any other deficiencies so if you have this condition called pots definitely start taking b1 do some research on this and comment down below hey guys so there people that really need this information so press the share button and let it way out there	Success

9 Ways to Become Nutritionally Deficient - Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH7etpYcv30	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so in this video I wanted to talk about nutritional deficiencies there hidden sources of why people have nutritional deficiencies especially despite taking vitamins now these nutrients that you taking to enhance your health usually are supposed to be in the food but the problem is the soils are so bad that it nutrients especially in the US so you have this empty harvest okay so you have that and then you have the other fact that people just don right amounts of food to get the nutrients but the nutrients help you in many different ways they helper factors that help chemistry work better through the body in the formation of body tissue and the formation of different body chemicals to allow the chemical process to occur protection against disease and like high sugar for example so like for example vitamin b1 protects you against the symptoms of high blood sugar so even though you have give to people with high blood sugar and someone and one of them is deficient in vitamin b1 that exhibit more symptoms from high blood sugar and this person might not so you can kind of look at vitamins as birth control pills for disease because they actually protect yourself from further damage so of course the most obvious thing is just not getting enough nutrients from the diet okay so we going to move beyond that we talk about some hidden reasons why you might be deficient okay that goes beyond just the diet one is you don enough stomach acid now let me explain what that means if you don hydrochloric acid you hard time absorbing minerals and trace minerals which are minerals needed but in much smaller amounts so the trace minerals would be like zinc selenium cobalt and the regular minerals minerals would be like calcium magnesium phosphorus so we need stomach acid to absorb the nutrients also we need that to help break down protein into amino acids so amino acid is a nutrient a micronutrient protein is a macronutrient so if you don have a problem with breaking down the protein the acid actually triggers an enzyme to break down the protein usually it dissolving it enzyme so you never get that release of the enzyme and then you end up with undigested protein and you get gas is the common symptom and the way that you know you have low stomach acid is that you have heartburn or indigestion or bloating okay that but there very strong acid which should be between 1 and 3 by the way which is very strong and it not able to kill off those microbes you you happen to develop a condition called SIBO which is a small intestinal bacterial overgrowth where microbes are now growing in the wrong place in the small intestine not the large you should not have all this microbial action going on in the small intestine and the problem with that is that you get an overgrowth in the wrong place and then those microbes eat up all your nutrients because in the small intestine that when you have 90% of the absorption of nutrients happen so if these guys are eating up all the fuel or the food particles and you don you just from that so one of the big causes of SIBO is low stomach acid so these are definitely connected ok and if you have SIBO you little tons of gas and you there test that your doctor can do to determine if you have it but you want to not add a lot of fiber or probiotics in there because that microbes more and we want to add more microbes to the system we want to do more stomach acid we want to do fasting and we want to do certain types of vegetables ok you can look up the video on SIBO and actually get more data ok number 2 low bile so your gallbladder is not working or it missing and you don and you the sufficient fat soluble vitamins vitamin A D E K k1 and k2 is really important in driving calcium out of the soft tissues out of the arteries out of the joints but M&A is for the eye so you night and can the immune system for the sinuses so you might develop sleep apnea or have sinus congestion vitamin D bone pain depression immune problems vitamin E you exert yourself and you feel tired really quick so you have no endurance or you might have angina pain that E deficiency so you can have all sorts of issues and also you won absorb the omega-3 fatty acids and DHA and that can lead to all sorts of things but again if you don you the fat soluble vitamins and the essential fatty acids okay despite taking them as supplements okay three low enzymes that pancreas because your pancreas produces most of the enzymes in the body and it supposed to determine what you put in your mouth you eat it it goes down here your body releases enzymes to break down those particles so you have this whole chemical reaction going on well if you actually consume a lot of the wrong foods over many years and you develop pre-diabetes or insulin resistance or you just basically kind of used up the enzymes because you foods which is really bad you don then the pancreas isn the enzymes people that have diabetes or prediabetes or insulin resistance just don function anymore so if they because the pancreas actually regulates insulin and another hormone called glucagon which is the blood sugar thing it regulates when you eat and when you don function of releasing the enzyme so if you don gonna have all sorts of undigested incomplete food going through particles going through and it bloating and gas other than that you be totally fine okay see Bo we talked about that it going to create deficiencies of nutrients and then number five decrease flora like your friendly bacteria it called microbiome and the large Wow let you took an antibiotic or you you know you GMO food which is in the grocery store which they don classified as an antibiotic by the way its patented by Monsanto it so it basically killing up the microbes and you digestive capacity you once had so without the flora you can the bile as well as you did before and that alone can create a whole chain reaction of things but the floor is very important in breaking down fiber also helping us make vitamins especially the B vitamins a biotin is one really important one so if you don enough biotin you the quality of skin hair is gonna be very poor so the flora gives you certain healthy acids that help blood sugar issues they help protect against microbes and pathogens but they also help make vitamins for you number six raw vegetables nuts and seeds there are certain compounds in raw foods that are protective antioxidants that protect the plant or not or seed against developing into an actual plant okay and so you have phytic acid you have enzyme inhibitors phytic acid in all these and even though that actually block the absorption of nutrients so this is why for some people when you actually just slightly steam the vegetable or even you get rid of that phytic acid or you soak these two things in water overnight you germinate them and it you absorb more nutrients some people can do do fine with this other people can that this could be a problem especially if you of these some the properties in some of these foods block the absorption of minerals kind of act as a key later it video on this you can watch it I a link down below this is a very common reason why people have nutritional deficiencies they insulin resistance what happens is the purpose of insulin is not just a regular blood sugar it nutrients in the cell so especially like minerals and even vitamins vitamin C especially so if you amounts of carbs and sugar and you have insulin resistance that problem for amino acids going into the cell formation of bone preventing a loss of collagen so you have this loose skin and you aren absorb them if you have instant resistance okay put a link down below to learn about that number eight non food based vitamins so you synthetic commercial vitamin and you thinking oh yeah this is really really healthy now it the real thing there made from chemicals so this is a situation where you bottom in okay don all vitamins are the same no it where do they come from what source of the vitamin I can see taking some synthetic vitamins if you taking a food based complex with it but just so you know if it it food okay bad diet how many people come up to me and they go what vitamins should I take but they haven diet yet well I think they your money so you have to fix the diet first then you can add supplements because taking supplements just it gonna you because the actual cause of your symptoms and the reason why you taking supplements comes from this bad diet so anyway I wanted to cover all nine of the hidden nutritional deficiency factors so you have more awareness all right thanks for watching hey guys so there people that really need this information so press the share button and let it way out there	Success
4 Remedies To Relieve Allergy Symptoms - Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b436sk5nJQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so recently had a question about allergies what is the best remedies for relieving allergy symptoms okay these are natural antihistamines number one is stinging nettle root this is normally good for inflammation in general but it congestion mucus things like that number two betaine hydrochloride you going to develop more allergy symptoms in an overly alkaline state okay so when you acidify the body you actually lessen the histamine effect the mucus effect histamines create runny nose fatigue tiredness things like that so when you acidify the body that will actually improve that situation and it also activates the immune system so it can work a lot faster you can get this in a pill form and take it even on an empty stomach there were three Spanish black radish okay you can even either consume this in your salad or you can even juice it one time I took I used a daikon radish and I juiced I think 11 or 12 ounces of this juice and I wanted an experiment to see what happened if I drank the juice right I drank the thing while I was plugging my nose and little did I know it was a very spicy radish okay and it burned all the way through my body but I tell you one thing it cleared up the mucus or really fast so Spanish black radish and just radishes in general are really good for mucus and also the deep mucus that might be impacted in your sinuses and lastly vitamin C okay most people know that vitamin C is good for mucus or allergies and colds and things like that if you going to take a synthetic version make sure you also at the same time take a whole food complex okay because if you take too much of one part of the vitamin C complex you can deplete the other factors because vitamin C in nature always comes in a complex alright well thanks for watching hey guys so there a whole bunch of people that really need this information so press the share button and let	Success
Silent Killer: Identifying Liver Cirrhosis Before It's Too Late	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1SddpHsus	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we detection of silent liver cirrhosis now here is basically scar tissue of the liver there is real no symptoms initially for decades until the later stages so you don cirrhosis however there is one symptom that most people do experience and that would be feeling sluggish and tired but that could be coming from a lot of different things you might not recognize it so the two categories of cirrhosis are compensated cirrhosis where the body symptoms in this phase and then over time you develop what decompensated cirrhosis where you start experiencing all these other symptoms so these are some of the symptoms that you experience when you have cirrhosis one is spider angioma which is something on your skin you have this little red dot with these little red like spider webs coming out from it xanthan Mo are little cholesterol spots sometimes you see them around the eyelids they yellow because the liver is not functioning correctly jaundice where your whites of your eyes become yellow and also your skin starts to become yellow that theater skin because you can collagen anymore so you get this paper like skin on the back of your hand and you can see it pretty much all over and then you have something called ascites which is a fluid-filled sac around your midsection it might look like it gut but it out from the liver creating like a potbelly next one gynecomastia which is basically breast tissue Club fingernails okay so they little clubbed shape edema in the lower leg you see this very very often with liver damage and you press your finger in the lower calf or the lower part of the leg and you lead a little dent okay that confusion bruising itchy skin itchy feet cognitive issues so your focus your memory your concentration just isn there so if you do research on cirrhosis you see that people get a list for a liver transplant they supportive medication for other diseases but they don do to prevent it or they don advice to what to do naturally but there that I want to sort out right now because they associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with diabetes and metabolic syndrome and obesity and so you just need to lose weight and manage your diabetes symptoms but they don effect in what comes first second and third well I now very simply it all starts with something called insulin resistance okay and that you disease it can be created from junk food a high carbohydrate diet sugar frequent eating drugs legally or illegally or even a virus could actually trigger insulin resistance okay when you have instant resistance you also have high levels of insulin okay then you to get inflammation so this condition creates a lot of inflammation the inflammation will also make the insulin resistance worse then comes the fatty liver 65 million Americans have a fatty liver that percentage so then after a fatty liver you get scar tissue that replaces the normal liver cell and that cirrhosis so you get the scar tissue so you have a combination of fatty liver and inflamed liver that then becomes filled with scar tissue and you lose function so in summary insulin resistance causes the liver to be fatty okay insulin resistance is basically what causes diabetes okay and diabetes you resistance type 2 diabetes I about that it goes from insulin resistance creates high insulin over a long period of time then what happens you get a burnin effects where the pancreas can and then the blood sugar starts going high that then it goes higher and then it full-blown diabetes type 2 metabolic syndrome is basically high cholesterol blood sugar problems belly fat all symptoms coming from insulin resistance they kind of put it in this syndrome like it itself when in fact it symptoms that are caused by this right here okay obesity it resistance high levels of insulin and then cirrhosis is also caused by instant resistance so this is really at the core of this right here so if you start having some of these symptoms I recommend that you start focusing on this right here improve insulin resistance and then see if these don improve as well I put a link down below for more information on this and what you need to do thanks for watching so I want to know about what you think about this video so please comment below and tell me what you think	Success
Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) Deficiency: The \"Great Imitator\" of Other Illnesses	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVXFqiPDwE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys today we vitamin b deficiency okay this is actually way more common than you might think the problem is when you do testing on this a lot of times it won the blood because the problem or the defect is in the enzyme that allows b1 to work and just if you wanted to get it tested the enzyme you would get tested for would be trans-keto lace okay it works with b1 in doing its function okay so but the problem is trying to find a lab that will test it anyway here lot of things but it enzymes it and five enzymes enzymes are the things that do the work in the body they involved in all sorts of bile body chemistry or chemical reactions especially in the mitochondria which is energy factory so b1 is essential to make those enzymes work so if you deficient in b1 the enzymes don and you fatigue is probably the most common symptom when you take vitamin b1 it seems to bring your energy right up most of the time and instead of going out and getting a test it and see if you feel better chances are you so in the next section i where to get b1 how much to take but in this section i how many different systems it with b1 deficiency is called berry berry and it known as the great mimicker of disease because it mimics so many other body situations it think probably if you are pre-diabetic if you have insulin resistance if you deficiency if you drink alcohol on a regular basis you probably have a b1 deficiency if you have a high carbohydrate diet you probably have a b1 deficiency because that develop a b1 deficiency so you definitely need b1 when you actually digest carbohydrates so too many refined carbs are going to deplete that so it involved in making energy it cell and the mitochondria against oxidation or free radicals it an antioxidant it also protects the cell against glycation which is basically when you combine a sugar with a protein or a sugar with a fat it develops like sticky protein it also protects you against developing amyloid plaquing in the brain that alzheimer a protein that clogs up the brain neural function there derrick longsdale md it kindle book it was like 79 dollars very expensive well worth it i could not stop reading it fascinating now the first system i going to talk about is the cardiovascular and respiratory system these are some of the symptoms that you can develop if you large heart because the heart has to work harder and then what happens is the heart gets bigger and bigger uh increase pulse rate edema usually in the lower ankles and things so you press your lower ankle and you get this indentation you see that a lot in diabetics microvascular damage your nerves need a blood supply so if you going to starve the food supply to the nervous system that peripheral neuropathy tingling burning and numbness and pain on your fingertips or the bottom of your feet okay so now let system you your stomach like you stuffed you can get constipated gastroparesis now what is that that system is very sluggish foods going through very very slow gerd which is kind of like a the valve on the top of the stomach doesn and you get acid that comes up through this way now these two conditions really come from low stomach acids hydrochloric acid and so vitamin b1 deficiency will create a situation where you have lower hcl hydrochloric acid thereby causing a sluggishness in the digestive system and causing gerd because it takes an acid stomach to keep that valve closed okay so you can see that it just so widespread it just goes way over here and it goes way over here and then the nervous system we talked about peripheral neuropathy but just neuritis in general any type of nerve pain or nerve damage that b1 is very intimately involved in that okay vertigo which is kind of a dizziness when you actually stand up too fast or even when you and you feel like you know you ship that could be coming from a b1 deficiency and then it affects something called the autonomic nervous system this is like the the combination between the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system and these are the two systems that work on automatic so they do a lot of different things so you can imagine how many different symptoms can occur from a problem within this system it okay excessive sweating or no sweating okay a lot of people have that and they don really know what it is and it find the cause of that but usually it deficiency anxiety especially nervous tension can fog exercise intolerance i mean how many people have a resistance to exercise right they they just don energy to exercise b1 insomnia you can a condition called pots pots is a condition where um your your ability to adapt to gravity and positional change is like completely ruined because the autonomic nervous system especially the sympathetic nervous system is dysfunctional so when you stand up the blood flow does not um keep up into the brain and you just get dizzy all the time so you basically have to lay around all day you can and down without feeling dizzy so these people absolutely positively should never go on a roller coaster because that would really mess them up but this is a b1 deficiency fascinating sleep apnea because the nerves that are affected in the brain stem control the respiratory centers so if those are not working because there not enough b1 you can have problems breathing and even just breathing in general is going to be a problem like you you can just for this reason there other ones we panic attacks b1 deficiency nightmares at night classic b1 deficiency lack of stamina just you know especially when you exercising you just you just you don because you just run out of gas real fast why because b1 is intimately involved in five enzymes in your mitochondria so if those enzymes aren your mitochondria is tired and all the different autoimmune diseases usually have a common symptom of fatigue that hashimoto take some b1 and see if you don feel a lot better a buildup of lactic acid see b1 helps get rid of lactic acid which is a byproduct of something in your metabolism in the mitochondria so if you don it out so you build up lactic acid you get this condition called lactic acidosis so you see that in a restless leg syndrome you see that too in people that have problems breathing if you you one of the side effects is lactic acidosis that black label which is a more severe label that it can cause this condition well the reason why it causes that condition is because one of the side effects of metformin is a b1 deficiency makes sense so you can builds up and you start becoming more acidic and then you have breathing problems recurrent ear infections interesting you have a problem with excess estrogen uh the worst type of estrogen you can have uh too much of is estradiol so without enough b you can clear it out because one of the functions would be one is to get rid of excess estradiol from your liver okay this next one let me explain is called ross i exactly what it is but just realize it like a free radical oxidation particle okay and it developed by your cells and b1 helps to reduce that oxidation remember it so you if you don when a woman is pregnant and she delivering a baby there is very dangerous for the baby and the mother the organs start becoming toxic and the heart becomes a problem the kidneys become an issue high blood pressure and even it so b1 will help prevent toxemia okay so the beta cells or the pancreas are affected those are the cells in the in the pancreas that basically make insulin so without enough b1 you going to make enough insulin if you need a lot of insulin because diabetics they can have to take even more than the average healthy person okay so stress buildup so when you don have enough b you highly irritable edgy little things will bug you you won tolerance for stress and a condition called sids sudden infant death syndrome that infant just stops breathing in in his or her sleep it because of the b1 effect of the respiratory centers okay so let so now why would you be deficient okay mainly sugar refined sugar empty calories if you take two diabetics okay and they and one is deficient in b1 but the other one is not this diabetic will experience a lot of the complications of diabetes this one will experience a lot less so b1 helps prevent the damage or at least the complications or the symptoms from high sugar okay carbs in general because the more carbs you consume the more b1 you need to metabolize those carbs white rice and this is a carb but i wanted to put this there because it really how they discovered uh beriberi white rice and all the b vitamins are on the the the hull okay so when you actually take the hall out so brown rice has the hall so they take it out and then you have this just pure carbohydrate white rice and then you consume that and you create a vitamin b1 deficiency that consume rice halls you would get b1 from that but this is the waste product of the white rice alcohol that depletes b1 big ton also heat like in pasteurization or cooking food you the older you are the lower b1 you going to have all right diabetes okay so diabetics are nearly always deficient in b1 that because b1 is intimately involved in the cell that makes insulin okay so if we have a problem with that then we have a deficiency something called polyphenols that would be coffee tea and wine so if you consume a lot of coffee or tea don b1 deficiency especially if you get that jittery if you drink a lot of coffee and you feel that jittery that feeling you just take some b1 it goes away within about four minutes okay gastric bypass you a deficiency of b1 simply because they they small intestine well guess where b1 is absorbed the first part of the small intestine if you had a gastric bypass i would recommend taking more b1 to somehow get it absorbed okay sulfites can create also a b1 deficiency and also raw fish if you have liver damage you going to be able to absorb the b1 as well anti-acids and antibiotics also deplete vitamin b1 caffeine will deplete it and if you don you also will not be able to absorb b1 but it also takes b1 to actually help you make stomach acid so it goes back and forth vaccinations can trigger a b1 deficiency and give the person pots okay there certain vaccine i much but you can look it up you vaccinations will deplete your b1 now the foods that are high in b1 would be liver yeast both baker nutritional yeast i like the nutritional yeast a little bit better because the taste of baker great and also it quality i now as far as the source of b1 i like the nutritional yeast unfortified i taking b1 by itself even if it long as you take either a natural source of b vitamins with it or if you just take nutritional yeast with it because anytime you take like one single vitamin over a long period of time it could deplete or throw out of balance the other factors because vitamin b is a complex it has a lot of different vitamins pork is high in b1 eggs fish sunflower seeds rice halls squash asparagus and seafood okay and again if you wanted to know the test that will determine if you deficiency trans-ketoglyce okay that it it that on you tender calves that reach down you grab your calf and it real tender you could have a b1 deficiency and increase effort to exercise so it really takes a tremendous amount of effort to start exercise so you just don that get up and go mojo okay and then take some b1 and then if you feel better and all of a sudden now you can exercise then you go personally when i exercise i take uh b1 i might take like 100 milligrams but then i yeast at the same time and i exercise on my bike and i notice when i take the b1 i can go a lot further in fact i probably can double the workout and i just feel like my body just has to exercise it and that that mitochondria ben photome okay that version of b1 it is synthetic however there hasn uh when they study this so i think this is totally fine but again make sure you take your nutritional use with it just to make sure you have the whole balance but benfotamine is really important with people that have nerve problems or alzheimer parkinson brain with memory because it innervates the brain 25 times more than the regular b1 that you would get that soluble because what they did is they made b1 into a fat soluble so it penetrates the brain which is all fat and the nerves so it neuropathy so if you were going to take benfotamine i would just take four tablets or i think they come in capsules just through the day and you should probably gonna see some great results especially if someone has alzheimer parkinson you improvement or peripheral neuropathy all right i know it but i wanted to give you all the aspects of b1 it vitamin thanks for watching so i want to know about what you think about this video so please comment below and tell me what you think	Success
Is Chlorine in Water (Tap Water) Really that Bad? - Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxguzOyFxQA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys today we chlorine in tap water okay now if you have city water hopefully you have a filter underneath your sink or in your whole house one point I want to bring up is that you actually if you if you don have a filter in your shower you can absorb a tremendous amount of chlorine [Applause] so it does go through the skin so there one is lung problems increase your risk for bladder cancer decreases your immune system of course the CDC says it so we know it toxic to fish but I do understand that you need to actually disinfect whatever need a good filter in your house but here you want to call your water company and you want to find out do they use just chlorine or a chemical called chloramine because the problem of chlorine is it evaporates easily and then it what they did is they added ammonia to make a new chemical compound called chloramine and which is highly persistent it stays in the water a lot longer but the problem is means it more toxic and regular activated carbon filters will not pull this out you need something a little different so if you have chlorine in your water supply you need to get a high grade catalytic carbon filter just a different filter you want to add either underneath the sink or for the whole house alright that watching you probably already subscribed but if you haven down below and I will keep you updated	Success
Do You Have a Copper Deficiency? - Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxeqP-QLIM8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	against today we copper deficiencies now no you can suck on a penny because that type of copper that to consume a copper that is actually from food not from a metal okay very important now what does copper do in the body well it helps form collagen and connective tissue and that you the elasticity with your connective tissue and get a symptom called swayback where your lower back is exaggerated going forward so you have this excessive lordosis or curve in your lower back but you can also have all sorts of problems with your ligaments even flat feet but these dysfunctions occur when you the womb when you you deficient these trace minerals that you could start having these problems okay so copper is a cofactor and by the way copper is a trace mineral which means you need it in very small amounts compared to other minerals that you need in large amounts so but it a helper mineral in certain enzymes enzymes do the work in the body they different structures and do different chemical processes so one of the enzymes helps make melanin which is a pigment in your skin okay so if you copper you can get something called vitiligo which is a loss of pigment so there in your in your skin and this enzyme called tyrosinase is present in mushrooms there extract you could take to help vitiligo okay because of what it does to melanin now copper is also involved in making neurotransmitters and these are kind of like communication particles that travel through the nervous system as compared to hormones travel through the blood so neurotransmitters are just another way the body can communicate very important in growth of the fetus so if you deficient you neurodegeneration which is basically breakdown of the nervous system one symptom being peripheral neuropathy which is the destruction of the nerves in your feet or your hands you see that a lot in diabetes loss of vision okay decrease white blood cells so your immune system actually is deficient you have a muscle weakness symptoms similar to a b12 deficiency anemia and lastly the foods that you can eat that are high in copper would be Easter make sure it general leafy greens and of course mushrooms alright I video if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
The Consequence of Missing Pregnancy Nutrition - Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzXdZfaI2x0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys today we the relationship between pregnancy and nutrients it that is going through pregnancy take the right type of nutrition I about just taking a synthetic prenatal I it a prenatal you want to do a food based prenatal don versions because it there planet that have serious nutritional deficiencies and if you pregnancy I can relationship between the fortification of nutrients and a growing healthy body if a woman who deficient in a either a mineral or a vitamin it creates huge consequences so let vitamin A deficiency vitamin A is is a fat soluble vitamin it vision and if a mother is deficient they can have all sorts of problems not just with night vision but the baby could have problems with the formation of the eye the cornea the membranes around the eye and vitamin A is very important in differentiating cells in other words you need vitamin A to tell the cell what to develop in to so I spinal cord heart ears specific types of tissues so if there vitamin A there in what cells are what premature birth okay low birth weight and miscarriage the best source of vitamin A is virgin cod liver oil I highly recommend that and then salmon and egg yolks okay then we get to vitamin D and then we have rickets okay that would be weak bones difficulty walking a loss of connective tissue that holds the bones together and you get vitamin D from the Sun dairy and fish and cod liver oil as well so then we have copper copper as a trace mineral so if a pregnant woman is deficient in copper the child could have what called swayback which is an excess curvature in the lower back so it of exaggerated the best source of copper is seafood like oysters lobster Krabbe seaweed or sea kelp okay you can get copper from that if you in iron you can have anemia and that can set the child up for all sorts of problems with miscarriages and low birth weight premature birth things like that red meat eggs seafood great source of iron and I definitely recommend a grass-fed liver okay iodine if you deficient in iodine you just a smaller child the brains not going to develop you cognitive issues the IQ is gonna be lower and also you can have a miscarriage okay get your iodine from seek help from a very good high quality location then we have the mineral magnesium okay and you have also selenium which is a trace mineral if you low birth weight miscarriage or preeclampsia which is a condition a very toxic condition where you have high blood pressure the organs become toxic and you can have all sorts of other complications you want to get these minerals from leafy greens seeds nuts and you can get a selenium from Brazil nuts and these trace minerals which are minerals needed in small amounts are really involved in the enzymes and enzymes help the formation of proteins which are all the organs then we have low vitamin b1 that can set the child up forgetting something called sudden infant death syndrome because b1 is involved in the autonomic nervous system development and the autonomic nervous system goes to the respiratory centers in the brainstem and that have the breathing centers so sleep apnea if you death syndrome SIDS if you toxemia is a condition where the mother issues kidney issues liver problems and there the fetus and also in the mother okay so pork actually believe it or not a high quality pork actually has a lot of b1 nutritional yeast is a really good source of vitamin b1 spare gas has b1 organ meats like liver has b1 okay let vitamin C deficiencies that in a lot of formation of collagen so you can get preeclampsia so there could be a problem with premature birth because if the placenta is detaching too quick and the water breaks and then the pregnancy starts kicking in there way too early when the infant is not formed yet so vitamin C bell peppers leafy greens sauerkraut very high in vitamin C okay then we get something called folate which is one of the B vitamins if you deficient you can develop something called neural tube defects which basically the spinal column and the spinal cord are not developing properly so you have this little bulge in the back where the spinal column is actually sticking out of the spine in the back which could be totally prevented if there also you can have cleft palate which you little stitches right here with where the formation of the top of the palate of the mouth is not formed and it going right into the nose right here and they have to do surgery and stitch that up right there so if someone takes bullet they can prevent this condition from happening this could also happen from being exposed to a pesticide and sometimes it can also be a vitamin A deficiency a lot of times it blamed on genetics but there are huge connections with nutrient deficiencies as well leafy greens okay so that it pregnant or even well before you pregnant to start eating healthy you thinking about having a child starting healthy for a long period of time get your body in really good shape and so that way when you have the baby everything is really smooth manganese okay another trace mineral very important in developing the skeletal structure and if you can have all sorts of problems with even flat feet a malformation of the bone the maxillary bone up here so you have either under bite or an overbite you probably going to need braces so if you looked at a common thread all the different minerals and trace minerals are very important in the formation of enzymes that then have to do with protein and building body tissue so you can see there deficiencies and also fat soluble vitamin deficiencies right here and even water-soluble vitamin deficiencies right here in relationship to a body that not forming correctly so here thing you can actually just not consume these nutrients because your diet is lacking them okay you can also be a pre-diabetic or a diabetic or have insulin resistance which by the way 65% of the population has either pre-diabetes or diabetes so chances are you might even have this in which case you well as you should compounded by the fact if your diet is poor too if we add these together then you to be deficient and so that prenatal really doesn refined foods going to fast food restaurants eating junk

The Eight Causes Of Edema - Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZLo_-jXwPw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey everyone we the aid actual causes of edema okay edema is swelling and the lower extremities and your ankles and your feet and you see people all the time with this and I dig into what things that are more common but I wanted to give you all the potential causes one actually it you example you don start to have a problem where your your ankle starts swelling up yeah so low protein in the blood when the protein the blood is called albumin if that low then the water accumulates in around the cells so you just need to add more approaching to the diet or improve the digestion by adding more betaine how to chloride or outside a vinegar to digest the protein all right number two low vitamin b1 and b1 deficiency is called beriberi and a lot of people haven deficiency because they many carbs or alcohol or tea or chocolate or various things I did a whole video on that but if you and b1 okay even sub clinically and sometimes it doesn blood test because it major thing but it can get swelling in the ankles okay in the feet so it take nutritional yeast and or b1 boom problem solved all right three low potassium if you greens then where coming from you need 4700 milligrams every single day so you have to figure out how you some potassium and meat-like like for example a chicken breast has like 300 milligrams but again you need 4700 so I like to get it from vegetables especially if you food fast food you sodium and very little potassium now if your salt sensitive or your you have too much sodium instead of actually reducing sodium increase potassium so if you were to consume very high potassium foods like believe it or not beet tops have the highest amount of potassium pistachios have a lot of potassium avocados have a lot of potassium Kayle has a lot of potassium so we we beef that up no pun intended and then what happens is your your swelling comes down because when you increase potassium you decrease sodium okay and sodium retains water so that will help and by the way usually down here diabetes is another cause if you have diabetes you and b1 and that could be why you retaining fluid so you have want to address this with health and keto in a minute fasting but if you or have insulin resistance or you pre-diabetic you just the nature of glucose you have too much glucose in the body you basically have like a fluid filled sponge and you heart if the heart is dysfunctional if you have heart disease you you usually gonna have swelling on the left ankle or foot okay so what causes this many things but diabetes or high insulin or sugar will do it okay eating junk foods so you would want to do something to improve the heart I have a lot of videos on that your liver if your liver is dysfunctional you have either a fatty liver or cirrhosis chances are you gonna have swelling more on the right ankle and foot okay but that can also cause a problem too so there videos on what to do if you have a liver problem I would say the best way to know if you have a liver problem is just look down right now and if you have a gut okay if you can see your gut you have a liver problem because that liver so you can get an ultrasound it pick it right up but in order for you to start getting that visceral fat the liver usually is filled with fat and then it spills over into around the organs and the visceral so you can it unless you do an ultrasound and there it gets to the later stages kidney you have two kidneys for their problem you both sides a lot of people have kidney problems if they so again that could be the reason why your you have swollen ankles and feet okay I mean the real answer to all of these is to get your eating correct there symptom like edema but they getting the food corrected and that what I recommend of course you this a million times healthy keto and in a minute fasting you knew you knew I was gonna say that right okay mix edema what is that it looks like swelling but it puffiness it waste product it different but you with like really big ankles and this is a a thyroid problem a slow thyroid and because Authority is so slow it retains this certain despite product I going to give you the technical name and that can make it make you look like you have edema okay so you hypothyroid issues do a search on that I have a lot of videos on that okay and then we have blood sugar issues diabetics pre-diabetics people with insulin resistance you fluid because the nature of the retention of sodium and then comes the water now if you actually have and these conditions and you drink a lot of water what happens is you fluid unless you get rid of the sodium and or increase the potassium so taking more potassium or electrolyte that has a lot of potassium will push this fluid out but you want to get to the root cause so I put a link down below for what I believe to be the best electrolyte but if you have a demon you must fix your diet alright thanks for watching hey if you content please subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
Best Tip for HashimotoÂs Hypothyroid - Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoAnO0EcCg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys so today we Hashimoto condition hypothyroid condition there another autoimmune related to the thyroid it called Graves and that would be a hyper thyroid so that speeds things up too fast hypo it gonna kind of walk you through some pieces of this puzzle an autoimmune condition is where your immune system your own body generating cells that are attacking itself called antibodies anti against the body okay and it that it pretty much any tissue in the body you can have an autoimmune to any tissue the nervous system the connective tissue even snow via fluid in the joints but as far as the thyroid goes there common antibody that that Hashimoto antibodies what does that mean basically it the peroxidase that thyroid peroxidase which is TPO as an enzyme that works with hydrogen peroxide to basically make thyroid hormones so it involved in making the thyroid hormone it iodine and then it converts it to the iodine that thyroid hormone because you have like t3 and t4 this the 4 and the 3 represent the number of iodine molecules in that protein in that hormone so to do that you need this chemical and this chemical together now they really don know exactly what causes this problem but we know it immune system we know that somehow it could be involved in your body dropping to defense of the immune system because many these conditions occur right after a stress event so you have this adrenal connection which also controls the immune system and then you have the immune Drina connection so that could be a link but when you have an autoimmune condition we do have excess hydrogen peroxide floating around and if you you may have some of this in your cupboard like this little this bottle of hydrogen peroxide that you use if you cut yourself to sterilize it okay to disinfect because it oxidant so it kind of bubbles and cleans bacteria kills bacteria so how did you / oxide if it levels it can actually create oxidative stress or damage so one thing we want to do is you want to kind of remove the excess amount of this right here and that because we want to increase our immune defenses we want to increase the antioxidant Network that actually fight and neutralize the oxidant so we start up with selenium selenium is a very powerful antioxidant it helpful in making thyroid hormones and also helping the conversion from the inactive to the active form zinc is another powerful antioxidant and there one more that has a very long name s acetyl l al very important antioxidant that will help clear out the excess amount of hydrogen peroxide so if I personally had Hashimoto some of the remedies that I would take to support that condition so we can actually remove some of the excess hydrogen peroxide because that can create more damage and I would focus also on just getting my body healthier and healthier and definitely include in a minute fasting because anytime you do prolong in a minute fasting but let say you do it once a month or once every other month you are going to drop inflammation your gonna help the immune system you are going to enhance the immune function alright thanks for watching if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
3 Key Minerals for PMS (Premenstrual Syndrome) Â Dr.Berg On Menstrual Cramps & PMS Food	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFp005TDrXY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys I three minerals that are really good if you got PMS or cramping related to your menstrual cycle okay calcium okay especially if you have menstrual cramping this is the best thing to take in fact what you should do is you should get a calcium magnesium together and and actually increase that to the point where your cramps go away improves PMS because it actually happens to help regulate estrogen and PMS is an estrogen dominant situation I have other videos and estrogen dominance but these three remedies are really good for PMS so it actually helps elevate your mood and then of course magnesium is involved in 300 different enzymes so it has a lot of functions especially with your muscles for calming down the nervous system for relaxing cramps and magnesium is involved in the enzymes involved in neurotransmitters like serotonin which actually helps bring up your mood all right then we have iodine okay iodine is a trace mineral and iodine helps balance and reduce excessive estrogen especially if there other symptoms of estrogen dominance like fibrocystic breast or cysts on the ovaries iodine is the key for that and you can get this from a high-quality sea kelp as an extra thing b6 in vitamin D are also good for this condition but these are the three minerals that I would recommend thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications daily notifications that sounds weird well I how about that	Success
What is Gynecomastia (Man Boobs)? - Dr.Berg on Liver	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvHmYmQspNk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys today we something called gynecomastia that boobs and the liver okay liver is involved in so many problems this issue is an estrogen problem but it is normally working correctly you should not have man boobs but it liver gets compromised whether it fatty liver and inflamed liver as hepatitis or liver that with scar tissue that that to detoxify estrogen and estrogen builds up and if you have breast tissue you have excessive estrogen and it just a matter of being exposed to estrogen directly there in the environment that mimics estrogen and that is called endocrine disrupters another name for endocrine disrupters is estrogen disruptors because it is those chemicals in environment that act like estrogen they call them Eadie would be things like pesticides insecticides herbicides fungicides it in the GMO food as glyphosate which is in almost every food right now it crazy it foods that have soy in them like soy protein isolates or soy oil it so avoid soy if you have this issue so what happens in the liver is that there 1 phase 2 enzymes which detoxify poisons or environmental poisons or hormones like estrogen and turns them into water-soluble harmless particles okay that happen and it excess estrogen what happens first is you have this spike in insulin because you okay and too many sugars and then what happens the liver becomes fatty it starts to develop scar tissue and that when you lose your ability to detoxify estrogen and there things that can also affect that as well alcohol especially if you you know a couple glasses wine every night over time that can affect the liver certain medic patience high blood pressure medications high cholesterol medications antidepressants all have side effects against the liver antibiotics okay so whether you carbohydrates and sugar or these things eventually it affects the liver and then you can a link down below for those of you that want to lower this and repair liver damage you want to do healthy ketosis and in a minute of fasting I put a link down below exactly how to do it step-by-step now as far as dismantling estrogen the key food group that does it is the cruciferous vegetables kale broccoli brussel sprouts bok choy radish arugula there cruciferous called dim dim is like the most potent concentrated cruciferous out there like two pounds of cruciferous vegetables in one tablet and you can get it I put a link down below for more information but dim is a very powerful detoxifier of estrogen it actually in helps enhance estrogen metabolism so if it actually gets rid of the bad and it enhances the good so we actually have the right amount it dim does not have any estrogen in it it and either as cruciferous even though it give you any estrogen it clears out the bad estrogen it rids the foreign estrogens the chemicals that mimic estrogen so it basically detoxifies estrogen so there you have it if you have manboobs focus on the liver thanks for watching hey if you this content please subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
The Inflammation Factor in Common Diseases Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHkvagiOE8U	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys today we the common threads between the real big healthcare problems out there heart disease cancer Alzheimer autoimmune diseases I about diabetes we little bit and there these are the main ones so let talk about heart disease what happens in the blood vessel of someone with heart disease as they start developing plaque okay and the plaque is built up with cholesterol and the person has usually high LDL and that cholesterol supposedly bad cholesterol but in reality LDL is low-density lipoprotein okay it has cholesterol in it but this is a protein okay and there but not any problem with protein if we take a look at a plaque it cholesterol calcium and proteins okay but people don and they don either right even though calcium makes up this plaque they really target this thing called cholesterol now the thing you need to know is before this piece of plaque develops there that starts it okay and it some inflammatory situation going on there of the artery in the heart okay and then it starts to build up and one of the best tests to do for the heart is called a coronary artery calcium test so the coronary artery calcium test is way more accurate in detecting heart disease than LDL or cholesterol or anything because they with heart disease we have something that destroys the wall of the artery usually it could be any number of things it could be an infection from a microbe it could be free iron in the body it could be some type of oxidant it could be a lot of sugar which is very very common like high blood sugar and anything that oxidate s the artery that starts the process of inflammation and starts building up this plaque okay then we get to something called Alzheimer have amyloid plaque II okay Emily plaque II is a type of protein okay so this is not coming from consuming too much protein or anything like that this comes from first having damage to the brain okay it could be from an infection it could be again from some oxidative thing that damages the brain so it could be from a chemical it could be from a whole bunch of things okay then you get the inflammation then would you have happen is the replacement of the damaged piece of the brain for amyloid protein so the body is trying to heal or protect or trying to patch something up it same thing with heart disease this plaque you know is considered something really evil but it the body heal this original wound right here same thing with Alzheimer unique about Alzheimer have cells that just can insulin so they the the cells need certain glucose or fuel like ketones so if you actually start off the the brain cells of their fuel source they start dying and you start getting Alzheimer what thing right here cancer because in cancer you have first stages damage to the mitochondria from some free radical thing or oxidant like could be free iron it could be radiation it could be a chemical in the environment of pesticide there carcinogens right so it creates damage within the mitochondria then as a way to salvage the mitochondria which is Energy Factory the body shifts to a different type of metabolism okay it ancient pathway that we don use but divided and switches to this thing at this level I don you the name of it and explain that because that opens up a whole dialogue but just realize that the body shifting to a different way that it metabolizes energy it on pure sugar or glutamine which is a very specific type of an amino acid okay these are the two types of fuel now the thing that with cancer is it spreads and follows areas of inflammation so it actually gravitates to areas of old injury as well or areas where you had trauma which is another interesting thing so cancer basically lives on sugar and it can also live on this protein but in Alzheimer there the body can like a severe state of insulin resistance they don exactly what happens but my guess is that the blood-brain barrier is so insulin resistant the fuel can into the brain of course another mode of fuel would be ketones but they don really tell you about that because then you can actually the cells can take up ketones and they don glucose then we have something called autoimmune okay where the body is developing antibodies which are against itself so you have a situation where our own immune system is attacking our own organs or glands now that it and it from this immune war that creates the collateral damage like in rheumatoid arthritis for example or MS you have your own body is destroying everything in its path way now there different theories as to the cause of this but it makes sense that the body is trying to kill something off that it doesn something that shouldn there ends up attacking itself now another interesting point about autoimmune is there that occurs right before a person develops these antibodies which is interesting the loss of a loved one they have this trauma and then they get this autoimmune disease okay it interesting point so I think what happening it this entire system usually probably the adrenal glands and then there loss of control there and the body tags the wrong thing that that just my guess at that but an autoimmune you also have amyloid plaque II know there condition called amyloidosis in which this plaquing okay goes into different organs like the kidney the liver the heart the pancreas cell okay and that what actually can even cause diabetes as well so again a common thing is this protein proteins involved in autoimmune there disease there involving Alzheimer another common thread and you have of course inflammation inflammation is like the the common theme between all of these conditions alright so I give you some key things six things that you can do based on this data to kind of prevent these issues number one you want to eat foods that give protective factors okay there are certain foods like cruciferous for example that can actually protect the mitochondria there protect the mitochondria especially from diabetes and blood sugar issues there are foods like vitamin C there are antioxidants that protect the heart vitamin E to protect this right here there are foods that protect the brain there are foods that protect the immune system okay so you want to start eating foods cruciferous grass-fed foods with healthy fats those are very very important avocados cod liver oil for example it want to keep your stress as low as possible so if you where it something quick to minimize that don be in a situation where the stress goes on and on for months and months and years and years I see that all the time because that could potentially set you up for this right here number three keep your Sugar levels of sugar is what starts this whole thing right here and also cancer lives on sugar too much sugar can actually increase my packing all right so we want to keep the sugar very low do low carb that the four keep your vitamins so you want to eat foods that are very vitamin rich nutrient rich mineral-rich increase the quality of those nutrients very important in protecting the tissues number five in termina fasting why because intimate fasting is the best tool to get rid of inflammation okay so you can at least take that piece of the puzzle out of the picture if you do if very therapeutic the body goes into an interesting shift in that it starts to heal and repair when you do in a minute fasting it that if you stop eating so frequently you would go the reverse but it doesn number six gut health and this is the last thing I because you have way more microbes in and around your body then you have your actual cells and it these microbes that can either really help you or hurt you depending on what kind of balance that you have and especially when you immune system you want to make sure your gut health you have enough probiotics you have enough fiber from the vegetables to feed the microbes to actually support a healthy immune system all right well thanks for watching if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future

Viral vs Bacterial Infection: What's the Difference? - Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMRCaKYthLg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so and another question from someone that wanted to know how do we tell the difference between a viral and a bacterial infection well it really difficult because the symptoms are so similar unless you get a blood test to rule out a bacterial infection you you of them fever you get a cold you have mucus muscle ache sore throat also realize that most respiratory infections are more viral but they can be bacterial and also you can have a combination between both of them together so it it days if it little bit longer about two weeks also realize that if it antibiotics will not work one of the problems that I see with a lot of people is that they run to the doctor every time they have a cold or infection they take an antibiotic what you resistance over time and they going to work eventually because every time you take them you set yourself up for microbes growing stronger resistance against these antibiotics and it also weakens your immune system it decreases the flora in your gut creates secondary infection so try not to do that very often that things that happen with infections number one is the direct damage the pathogen causes on your body tissue but also the collateral damage that your own body releases certain oxidants to kill off the microbes okay one thing that can protect you against that is putting your body in ketosis when you increase ketones you can decrease the damage from these oxidants that your own immune system is releasing that going into ketosis is very very beneficial when you because you may not really know if it a bacterial or a viral thing here remedies that I recommend first one is olive leaf extract this is really good for putting viruses back in remission but it can also be good for bacteria okay calcium calcium is really good to help the viruses go back and remission because realize that a virus is not really alive in the first place it piece of Menelik material wrapped in a sack that can only invade our tissues if our resistance is low okay if you susceptible to getting that virus so now let someone certain people that may get sick certain people that won your resistance your your sleeping your stress level especially stress your diet your nutrients in your body so as long as you are fortified with nutrition as long as your have a low stress that changes a beginning and are a lot less okay but the point is that calcium helps to put these viruses back in remission I always recommend if you have small children if they have a fever give them a little calcium it seems to work really well also you want to increase your temperature so climb in bed with a lot of covers and clothes on so you can sweat that hot bath hot shower to increase the temperature which actually can help speed things up garlic very good for bacterial and viral infections put garlic and everything eat the cloves have pickle garlic garlic and onion really good to consume and the last thing the most important thing is the fasting when you are sick you lose your appetite usually right well that because your body is telling you don eat so fast and can greatly speed up the time it takes to overcome these infections so fast as long as you can don you can actually really get through this a lot faster thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications daily notifications that sounds weird well I you on a daily basis about that	Success
The Reason for Strong Odor on Keto Diet Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uANY0j-UzVs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys I wanted to do a quick video on the strong odor on Keita whether it your urine or your breath what you can do and what it is alright so let me just talk about all the reasons that you can have a strong odor mainly in your urine sometimes through the breath okay so the first one is liver damage that can create a strong odor in your urine and definitely in your breath okay an infection can cause a strong odor in your urine all right dehydration that could do it because your urine is so concentrated asparagus will make your urine smell pretty funky and if you consume too much protein so if you 3 to 6 ounces of actual protein per meal okay not per day per meal that could be an issue especially if you don enough stomach acid now as you get on keto and your carbs are actually lower than 20 grams or your fasting or you doing intense exercise what happen is that your ketones are going to go up the one that actually creates the most technical odor on breath and in urine is acetone this is a type of ketone there this is one of them okay so then there actually a meter that you can get a breath meter that you can detect this as well but if your urine is darker and cloudy and you have this odor the strong odor chances are it acetone now acetone is also used as a nail-polish remover you don concerned about that because that something completely separate your body actually makes acetone naturally as a natural consequence of consuming more fat and less carbs it so it what I increase chlorophyll and your diet that is a deodorizer where chlorophyll leafy greens lots of salad a lot of leafy green vegetables number two add a bit more fluids that would be not just water but electrolytes with it to be more hydrated number three consume apple cider with each meal that will help you for moderate protein make sure you going crazy with the protein and one last thing I noticed when people get on keto but they go off it and they go on it so the body is constantly dumping out excessive acetone and because it an efficient machine at the cell level to fully burn up 100% of the ketones so you actually end up with a bit more acetone because these are just basically unused ketones so you fat and you a certain quantity but if you were to do this more consistently and not go off but be very strict your system is going to become way more efficient and you going to burn these up to the point where you in the urine and the breath and you have less odor all right thanks for watching if you please subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
What Are Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)? - Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUUsTbeu4LE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys in this video I to define Ross this will probably come up if you relating to Alzheimer of ketosis you might see Ross come up and I just wanted to find it because it can be a little confusing and in reality it Ross stands for reactive oxygen species now what the heck does that mean so Ross can either be a free radical or a non free radical involving oxygen so this kind of let radical a normal atom has paired electrons so if you have something that envision it like a little disc and two little weights on on the outside that spin it nothing and smooth but if you take one of those electrons out and you have an unpaired electron and it starts to spin or move it can really be a radical and move in a radical way in create destruction because it does not have a parent electron okay so free radicals tend to destroy things now the body makes ross also ross can be generated from the environment as well coming into the body but the question is why would your body make something that and this will help you understand what it is well there is a natural process a natural program cell death in the body it condition where your body is actually killing off certain cells now you might say well that but actually it life okay because your body has this urge to survive so it greater good if there that are mutated altered they dysfunctional then the body has to get rid of them and that Ross so Ross has the ability to eliminate certain things that we don want in the body and if that involves killing off certain mitochondria or whatever that your white blood cells produce these to actually kill off microbes that so your body has this interesting balance between free radicals or oxidants and antioxidants so your body can make any oxidants as well and you can get them environmentally so you have this whole balance that happens in the body so whether you certain stress that called oxidative stress so let metal in your body from iron and that created a mutation in your mitochondria well your body would produce this to get rid of that the body does not want mutated cells exposure to chemicals UV radiation that would come from external or exercise produces higher levels of Ross to actually kill off the damaged muscle cells that are that need to be replaced and it cell so it actually just grows back hypoxia decreased oxygen pollution smoking infection so your body is constantly cleaning all this stuff up and replacing it so this is a real positive thing so you probably in your house have hydrogen peroxide and you can put it on a cut or a wound and see it foam up because hydrogen peroxide is this and that actually helps to kill off certain microbes okay the same principle what reduce the excess Ross in the body so ketones can act as an antioxidant and they protect the nerves they is why ketones are so good for the brain and high sugar diet or high carb diet is so terrible for the brain because it actually causes so much destruction and it leads to things like dementia and then eventually Alzheimer just wanted to explain what this is as simply as possible hopefully you understand it now and thanks for watching if you please subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
Reduce Respiratory Mucus with Salt - Dr.Berg On Chest Infection, Chronic Bronchitis & Lung Cleanse	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC1T6gtzbjA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so another question what is good for respiratory mucus whether it lung whether it or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease lung conditions asthma sinus infections sleep apnea mucus deep into the sinus cavities it using salt not necessarily taking salt but breathing in salt there called a hallo generator which basically gives you something called hallo therapy which is breathing in salt air so this machines basically take the salt and ionized it and put into the air so you would have it running when you sleeping at night it can actually loosen up the mucus in your lungs and your sinuses and your throat salt has the capacity to make mucus thinner its antifungal its antibacterial its anti mold so it put a link down below of a couple different options I with any of these companies but I saw some really good ones that you can either do a neti pot or you can get a device that generates salt air right in your room while you more thing you really want to check for any mold in the house because if there is mold or mildew that could be enough to keep your lungs constantly filled up with mucus and you change your environment and go into a different location also in this the sinus mucus completely goes away so it could be a source of the actual cause of your mucus from a nutritional standpoint the regular oil is really good for mucus and garlic and fasting but if you can actually do a longer fast let every month for a 48 or 72 hours you can put your body in some serious it called a tapa G which will help clean up the deep old damaged proteins and improve your immune system and also deactivate viruses in the body clean up microbes it your immune system but oregano oil is also good for that as well if you have a virus and sometimes it of fungal back and even viral then olive leaf extract is what you need to try alright so those are my recommendations for getting rid of this thing right here thanks for watching if you please subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
Natural Antibiotics for C. Difficile Infection (Clostridium Difficile) - Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mio_jwXLFs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so in this video I want to discuss something called c-diff okay that stands for a microbe called Clostridium difficile I want to discuss a remedy that you may be interested in especially if your antibiotic resistant okay it very common infection a lot of people get exposed to it when they work in a hospital like you have nurses and doctors and people that work in nursing homes get it so here are the symptoms severe diarrhea cramping abdominal pain inflammation in your colon a lot of times it occurs after you take an antibiotic there infections every single year 30,000 related deaths and 15,000 direct deaths caused from this microbe so it nasty very dangerous microbe so the real big goal is to restore your friendly bacteria the thing that to protect you because you be susceptible to getting its infection once you lose your defenses so you really want to find a really good broad-spectrum probiotic and start taking that but as an immediate thing there recommend one is black seed oil and number two is myrrh extract don this one in an alcohol base get it in a tablet form these two can potentially act as a natural antibiotic without the side effect so if you have the combination of taking a friendly bacteria and these two over time and also of course working on your eating especially in a minute fasting that going to be really important the combination of those things will be very beneficial to help you overcome this microbe because the problem is every time you take another antibiotic it weakens your system and it increases your chance of getting it again and again alright thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications daily notifications that sounds weird well I how about that	Success
Are You Dehydrated? | Simple Test For Dehydration by Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqHim1SVAv0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I want to show you a real simple test to see if you determines the volume of your fluid in your body your extracellular fluid volume is this one electrolyte sodium now there minerals involved but sodium is the driving force to maintain this fluid so if you have too much sodium in the body you swelling and you see this in cardiovascular disease and then is a condition called ascites this is where your gut is just fluid filled it a basketball usually the person is thin and they get this huge protruding belly that liver is filled with scar tissue cirrhosis it fluid into a sac around your abdomen and you kidney disease or diabetes but when you dehydrated you can have low blood pressure low nutrients because there not enough pressure to drive the nutrients through the body and you can also have low oxygen because you getting the circulation to the different parts of the body so there simple test where you pinching the skin and you how fast it comes back okay to normal you trigger which means just the fluid and pressure right underneath your skin so you just pinch the skin for a couple seconds and it should come right back okay so if it let it takes to come back the more dehydrated you are so if you pinch this for a few seconds and it for a few seconds you are severely dehydrated so I have a lot of videos in the ketogenic diet and if you don what that is I below for more information but when you do a ketogenic diet the need for salt goes up because before when you a higher carbohydrate diet you retaining sodium okay but now on keto you consume more salt about a teaspoon a day but let diarrhea or vomiting or you diuretics that could be another reason why you now that doesn test another interesting point on sodium is a condition called hyponatremia where you you have a low sodium because you drinking excessive amounts of water now remember it the volume of fluid outside the cell it this fluid so if you amounts of water of course without the sodium because you seawater you so in this situation you in sodium you series of other problems like heart problems even actually swelling in the brain but that let of salt and you fluid well you could be dehydrated from that because you also need to increase the fluid with the salt and it combination of both of those so the most common thing that I see when you start a ketogenic plan is that you enough salt but always use sea salt by the way and in addition to that maybe you the combination is important now there one last point I want to bring up that has to do with your adrenal glands if you have a severe adrenal problem okay where the adrenal glands are basically shut down and the condition is called Addison you no longer can retain sodium so you which case you dehydrated and people with Addison need to consume a lot of salt because this goes right through them alright guys so go ahead and do this test right now in comment below on the results hey guys I yet dr.

How To Stop A Cold At The First Sign Â Dr.Berg On Cold Symptoms & Intermittent Fasting	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K-nq704I8E	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so in this video we want to talk about what you can do at the first sign of a cold let sick is there anything that you can do to prevent it or reduce the time it takes to overcome whether it infection or a bacterial infection there are several things that you can do to hopefully minimize the infection and speed things up and maybe even prevent it okay zinc is really really important okay zinc and vitamin C but I recommend don supplement you could take a food base vitamin C what actual lemons not even lemon juice because lemon juice is pasteurized vitamin C is sensitive to oxygen in heat so we want the actual lemon so maybe consume like two lemons and that will give you a good amount of vitamin C to help you so we have zinc vitamin C these two are very very important apple cider vinegar why because when you acidify the body without cider vinegar you speed up these things called phagocytes phagocytes help clean up bacteria in the body so in other words acidifying the body can potentially speed up the white blood cell action the immune system alright garlic the most powerful thing for viruses that I know and also its antibacterial antifungal so start consuming garlic maybe in a soup chop it up consume it but the key is making sure you do this right when you get the first symptom and then we have in a minute fasting this is probably the most important right here so if you start to get sick in a minute fasting is what you need to do why because the body can go into repair mode the body starts to increase its resistance to stress and all sorts of interesting things happen at the cellular level to help your immune system so in a minute fasting is very very important so at the first sign of a cold you don or a so-called nourishing your body you want to stop eating this will help you greatly and number five this is actually very very important there event connected do whatever you can to reduce the stress it and of course no sugar or alcohol or milk products because that can also feed the bacteria and also keep that infection there a lot longer but there one less point I want to talk about that being exposed to a virus or a bacteria okay usually some people will get the infection some people won that has to do with your own internal resistance or your susceptibility to that virus or bacteria your immune system is strong if you if you have this health reserve and you probably not going to get it so if you feel rundown and you feel like you could be susceptible to getting something and let plane somewhere and everyone coughing and sneezing maybe you want to actually take zinc on lemon and even some upside of vinegar and garlicky before you get on that plane and then of course you know doing a minute fast due to this is all gonna help you build up your resistance and then I forgot about one last thing asleep if you have enough sleep that can actually help you increase the resistance against an infection versus being tired that all right guys there you have it these are all the elements involved in to helping you prevent a full-blown cold or infection if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success

Best Foods For Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH7Ox6aYwxc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so in this video we benign prostatic hyperplasia okay where the prostate is enlarging like what behind this and what foods you need to consume to get this under control the problem with this condition is it going to obstruct your urine flow and the urine is gonna back up into the kidney and that toxicity they could even back up into the liver and because you get rid of the urine so it concentrates and there now this condition is really affected by hormones there hormones that have different effects certain hormones have an anabolic effect on your body that means that those hormones have the ability to make things grow alright so now let list and talk about what hormones are involved the first one is insulin insulin is an anabolic hormone it makes things get bigger and you want to make sure you don so how would you do that healthy ketosis and especially in a minute fasting very very very important number to IDF one what is that this hormone insulin like growth factor is similar to insulin but it similar to growth hormone okay so you have human growth room in the body that has all these different effects that definitely anabolic but growth hormone then triggers the liver to make IGF which is a another type of growth hormone but I don much detail in this video about these hormones all I want you to know is that this hormone is another hormone that can make things grow in the body and to keep this under control you want to make sure you don any dairy and make sure you don consume excessive amounts of protein so you don we diet without dairy if you have a prostate problem number three testosterone now testosterone can also convert to a more powerful form of testosterone which is DHT now the studies on this topic are mixed some studies show that testosterone and E HG protects against this condition other studies show that it can actually worsen the condition so at this point we really don or decrease it but what we do know is this testosterone is converted to DHT due a hormone called 5-alpha reductase and some of the most powerful inhibitors of this enzyme help improve in a large prostate and that would be salt palmetto and a stinging nettle root so these are two powerful enzymes that can help less than the amount of DHT produced so one point about stinging nettle Road if you sure you do in larger amounts not in smaller amounts alright let number four estrogen I really believe that estrogen is one of the more potent influences of an enlarged prostate in addition to insulin so these two here have a huge influence on whether you have an enlarged prostate or not and this hormone right here is a female hormone but men have a certain amount of estrogen but they have too much of it now your testosterone can also convert to estrogen in your body through another enzyme and this could be a problem right here so the question is how would you block this enzyme well it just so happens there are inhibitors of this enzyme to lessen the amount of estrogen produced and the best foods to give you these inhibitors would be the cruciferous vegetables there compound called dim which is a very powerful enzyme inhibitor and dim is a very concentrated cruciferous compound so the phytonutrients in cruciferous vegetables whether you concentrated form or the vegetables themself help to inhibit this enzyme and help to lessen the amount of estrogen produced you also want to be careful of all the other things that can actually raise estrogen in the body soy protein isolates in the foods that you eat or the oils that are GMO like soy and corn and canola and cottonseed oil all can actually increase estrogen in the body and that could be why you have too much estrogen in the body so you want to do organic foods wild-caught fed pasture-raised eggs to make sure that we limit the amount of estrogen in the body one additional point I want to talk about is sometimes when people do a key tell they don for example the foods on keto despite lowering insulin because they hiring carb might contain things that increase estrogen so just because you on keto doesn reducing this hormone right here so anyway I just wanted to create this video to show you the effects that certain hormones can have on the prostate gland thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications daily notifications that sounds weird well I you on a daily basis about that	Success
Reasons Why You Have Leg Cramps At Night (Nocturnal Leg Cramps)? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEMBTx2EtFw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I wanted to talk about all the different reasons why you may have leg cramps at night it leg cramps okay are nocturnal cramps all right first one is low potassium okay potassium is intimately involved in the contraction and relaxation of your muscles so if there potassium you tightening of that muscle low sodium which is an electrolyte can also cause cramping not as common but it can magnesium another common one potassium in magnesium deficiencies are probably the two top minerals that are involved with leg cramping because these minerals are needed to relax the muscle it surprising when a lot of people are deficient in this mineral in this mineral simply because they don consume enough leafy greens they have a lot of sodium but they have not enough potassium foods or magnesium foods and then we have calcium if you calcium which by the way are also in greens and dairy but if you don enough calcium that can also cause a cramp another reason is that your pH of your blood is slightly too excessively alkaline okay and there there but if it goes too far to one side and too alkaline what transported so everything kind of locks up but you have tetany or like twitching right here on your arm because the muscles are not in their normal tone okay so if the pH is off these minerals can transported into the muscle and you can have techne spasms cramping and all sorts of muscle and nerve problem but I want to talk about another cause of leg cramps at night that go beyond some of these minerals and it has to do with a vitamin okay vitamin e deficiencies okay a vitamin D deficiency will cause restless legs now you can also be deficient in vitamin b1 and have restless legs as well but vitamin E will do it too because vitamin E is involved in oxygen carrying capacity in the muscle it of glycogen which is the sugar in the muscle now if you still using some of your glycogen reserve ok so especially at night you gonna use that up and then you to burn more fat but I also want to include a couple studies down below in using vitamin E to get rid of nocturnal cramps okay now when you take vitamin E number one make sure it synthetic version make sure you take a food concentrate a blend of several of the natural parts to this complex and make sure you take an empty stomach 15 minutes before you eat it alright guys there you have it thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications daily notifications that sounds weird well I on a daily basis how about that	Success
Is There A Relation Between The Epstein Barr Virus And Fatigue? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8WwNeP5J3o	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we relationship between epstein-barr virus and fatigue 90% of the population of Earth has epstein-barr virus called the kissing virus it can create a lot of problems I had it when I was in high school it was very severe because it it breathe it was terrible this fatigue and fever swollen glands achy severe sore throat okay sometimes it takes three to four weeks to recover but what happens is it goes into a dormant phase and what interesting is it has a unique strategy of in activating our own immune system from killing it from trying to kill it basically that can be reactivated later in life it called the late infection the epstein-barr virus is involved in a lot of health problems linked to Hashimoto which is an autoimmune Ms which is another autoimmune and even cancer non-hodgkins lymphoma and chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia and just weird chronic symptoms that people can happens is several things number one you go through a huge stress let you have a nutritional deficiency and then this virus gets reactivated not as a full-blown infection that maybe is maybe as the fatigue portion okay or maybe you start getting a key you don stress that activated stress seems to lower the immune system and allow the virus to come out of remission this virus is not really alive it can only live off our energy from ourselves but if you keep healthy it can so what can you do besides moving to a desert island by yourself and eliminating all the stress there great remedy that I you do research I below it is a compound that is from the earth it really interesting antiviral properties it metals and it seems to neutralize certain other chemicals like pesticides and herbicides and even glyphosate now what happens with glyphosate which is that GMO herbicide is it throws off our microbiome our gut flora not to mention the soils flora and guess where our immune system is located a lot of it in the gut so my theory is that with the combination of the glyphosate and this virus together I think this can activate this thing right here and potentially increase your risk for getting this because if you look at some of the research on glyphosate it can increase the risk of getting this by itself so I don theory I have I don so if you have any one of these symptoms and let there start taking this and it could potentially help you and in addition to that really start focusing on your stress level and your flora and lastly make sure you do organic foods non-gmo alright thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications daily notifications that sounds weird well I basis how about that	Success

Is It a Vitamin D3 OR Calcium Deficiency? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-IpzwZJDYM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we vitamin D in calcium it interesting this symptoms of a vitamin D deficiency are very similar to a calcium deficiency so let through vitamin D first if you deficient in vitamin D you can have chronic low back pain you can be actually at bone pain or pain anywhere in the body but a lot of times it the lower back in fact that first symptoms if your calcium deficient you can also have achy muscles and achy joints as well next one is muscle weakness that from a vitamin D deficiency as well muscle spasm okay in a calcium deficiency you could have muscle cramps in the cat enough vitamin D can cause the calcium deficiency because one of the functions of vitamin D is to increase the absorption of calcium by 20 times okay in the small intestine okay nonspecific pain so it could be like fibromyalgia or some weird pain but it identify that maybe migrates and changes daytime drowsiness so let the day you doing work and you just want to take a nap but you know you it could be your vitamin D levels also mood changes too that happens in the winter because you pressure that about amedy deficiency because without vitamin D your arteries get stiff okay and then low immunity so you can have a respiratory infection now when you sick maybe your mother or your grandmother told you to consume cod liver oil or you might have heard that before cod liver oil is loaded with vitamin D and vitamin A really good for the immune system so as soon as you start getting sick you should take that but vitamin D it system and it actually even acts like a hormone as well okay sweaty head so let that just is sweating excessively in the head or a small child give them some vitamin D structural problems and kids or even babies I ever heard of a condition called rickets the most common cause of rickets is a vitamin D deficiency but you can also develop it from not having enough calcium so in rickets you have soft bones so you increase the risk of getting scoliosis your knees become bowed or knock-kneed you have a lot of structural problems in the teeth all sorts of issues with that okay now in calcium we have aches tingling in the lips the mouth the feet in the hands and this can also mimic a b1 deficiency as well because you can have peripheral neuropathy so you get muscle cramps bruising okay you see that in the lower part of the body in the extremities like in your in your legs fatigue which is similar to this right here throat spasm so you have this chronic cough or irritation in your your vocal cords okay then you have tetany which is a little twitch underneath the eye or the arm or even any large muscle can actually twitch because of low calcium also one point about calcium is that you need a certain pH for calcium to be mobilized so if your stomach is too alkaline not only are you going to have acid reflux you appearance of calcium deficiencies because you can well you can minerals that well so if you don the right pH in your stomach you going to absorb minerals so sometimes it vitamin D or you or do you need calcium most people do not need extra calcium and I don calcium I recommend you get your calcium from food unless you have osteopenia or osteoporosis because a lot of times people are just taking way too much of this in a pill form and it problem I would imagine most people have too much calcium it enough but what they really need is vitamin D to release this right here through the body now yes you can get your calcium from dairy like cheese and things like that but you can also get it from leafy greens like kale spinach well the problem with spinach even though it has calcium it has oxalates which actually bind the calcium so you to either steam it or cook the spinach then consume it to get the calcium but I would recommend you get your calcium from other greens I put a link down below for more information about a good sources of calcium now if you have a problem with your kidney you won able to absorb calcium that well I already talked about not having enough in the diet and also not having enough stomach acid and you can also have a parathyroid problem this usually occurs if you have your thyroid removed because the parathyroid glands there them that are attached to your thyroid so many times when they take out the thyroid they remove the parathyroid and now you have a calcium issue there other reasons but they electromagnetic frequency okay it coming from the cellphones and the Wi-Fi when you calcium inside and you have all sorts of issues so again there different causes to problems with calcium and when you have too much intracellular calcium you also can at the same time have a calcium deficiency because the calcium is unavailable to you it it should not be and that doctors will give something called calcium channel blockers to lower blood pressure because there intracellular calcium okay glucose so if you high carbohydrate diet you can have low calcium from that a lot of people have insulin resistance which actually then could increase the insulin and also create a problem with the calcium and lastly you can it be dis deficient in magnesium and again magnesium and calcium work together without enough magnesium it balance out the calcium and this comes from leafy greens how do you become deficient in vitamin D well no Sun it consume fats let low-fat diet well guess what you get your vitamin D from fats fatty fish liver or egg yolks but you can also get it from mushrooms as well now one of the best sources of vitamin D from a food base is cod liver oil now if you actually are missing a gallbladder or have a gallbladder problem or a fatty liver or a problem with the liver you won absorb vitamin D as well because you need the bile produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder to be able to absorb and breakdown and utilize this right here so no gall bladder problem with liver low vitamin D level so you have to take more to create the same effect or take it with purified bile salts and also by the way I have a vitamin D supplement and the reason why I created one is because I wanted something that had vitamin k2 in the right ratios vitamin k2 works with vitamin d3 to transport calcium in the right place but I recently added another ingredient which is called purified bile salts to increase dramatically the absorption of both d3 and k2 so I put a link down below for more data on there so if you don in vitamin D low fat diet low vitamin D stress high cortisol can block bottom indeed gastric bypass vitamin D problem a colon issue let irritable bowel syndrome or some type of scar tissue in your colon it hard to observe vitamin D if you taken too many sun blockers well you not going to get vitamin D so the relationship between vitamin D and calcium is interesting the symptoms cross over you have to look at the big picture most the time people just need more of this and not this alright thanks for watching so to prevent me from running at a Content I have a new survey I want to find out what you are interested in so please fill it out the links down below	Success
Subclinical Pellagra (Vitamin B3 Deficiency) Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVXUdhH7z0M	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we subclinical pellagra okay soap Allegra is a vitamin b3 deficiency and when you have pellagra it classical b3 deficiency and then it called the three DS dementia diarrhea and you get dermatitis okay usually around the neck in the hands can be a pretty serious condition but there is also a subclinical pellagra where you not you don deficiency but you are deficient okay and I would create as far as symptoms there a neurological condition called neurasthenia which is exhaustion of the central nervous system so the energy reserves of your nervous system in the mitochondria is exhausted so you mentally exhausted you headache irritable intracranial pressure digestive issues fainting if you get up too fast also you have different neurological perception changes as well let the mirror at yourself and you just see that the your face is changing okay or let a piece of paper and the words are moving or you is moving or you at the picture and you see it going back and forth it can also affect your taste you lose the sense of taste and smell and sometimes you actually smell something that so b3 or niacin is really a coenzyme involved in a lot of different chemical reactions inside the body especially in the mitochondria the energy factor of the cell and the way you could become depleted is by drinking a lot of alcohol like in college right chronic diarrhea excessive leucine that inflamed gut gastric by-pass consuming too much corn corn has a protein that can block the absorption of vitamin b3 also refined carbohydrates and refined sugars will also create a vitamin b3 deficiency niacin which is b3 has the ability to protect against diabetes especially type 1 so it helps counter the destruction or the oxidation of the cell that makes insulin nice and also can lower your cholesterol so you can see that vitamin b3 is very very important in a lot of different functions I recommend getting your b3 from nutritional yeast but if you have any of these symptoms right here start taking niacin in higher amounts and you can safely take nice and at 10 to 15 X the normal amounts all right guys I you the next video so to prevent me from running out of content I have a new survey I want to find out what you are interested in so please fill it out the links down below	Success
Why Do I Have Low Cortisol Symptoms With High Cortisol? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxC3OYS_an4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hi so in this video we about why someone could actually have low cortisol symptoms yet on a blood test or a saliva test they have high levels of cortisol how can that be it a bit confusing so many people have symptoms of low and high together and they typically symptoms with low cortisol include inflammation why because cortisol is one of the most powerful anti-inflammatory hormones so if you don inflammatory conditions arthritis autoimmune etc and this is why they get a lot of viruses they have a poor immune system so they frequently they might have skin color changes like vitiligo or their skin just looks a little bit darker salt cravings okay Sall symptoms with below and with high cortisol belly fat high blood pressure allergies pitching to insomnia thin legs no but all gut acid reflux okay the pre-diabetic or are they developed diabetes think about when someone actually is injected with prednisone one of the side effects is sometimes they get diabetes from that why because high levels of cortisol mobilize a tremendous amount of sugar okay in the body okay so there there resistance very similar to insulin resistance where you have the gland the adrenal gland that makes cortisol sending this hormone to the blood it connects to the receptor but the receptor is downgraded it it hormone and then what happens is we don telling the the gland to turn off so we have a dream which only has an on switch no off switch massive flood of cortisol your body will protect itself by not letting this cortisol in the cell so we have certain parts of the body that are completely deprived of cortisol and other parts of the body which we have way too much cortisol okay and this is why you can have a combination of both but what too much cortisol that receptor ineffective at absorbing this cortisol so we were left with chronic inflammation we viral infection that won it fatigue syndrome they have asthma they have chronic skin inflammatory conditions they have a lot of skin issues a lot of gut issues a lot of inflammation other than that they perfectly fine all right so I hope that sort out the confusion but now the question is what do you do I already created a nice long video on what to do in a stress webinar I put a link down below and that will walk you through step by step what you should do if you have an overactive adrenal gland all right thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications daily notifications that sounds weird well I on a daily basis how about that	Success

Will Eating Fat Make My Liver Fat? Â Dr.Berg On Causes of Fatty Liver & High Fat Foods	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyV6gKaN4pY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	alright guys so today we the question will eating fat make my liver of fat okay I did have a question from someone that wanted to know about this they were concerned about this I eating this ketogenic diet it in fat isn liver okay well let the number one cause of a fatty liver would be alcohol okay that number two would be fructose high fructose corn syrup all right and number three would be high carb diets but let go to the research and see what that says okay well I was only able to find one study okay on this topic there actually not a lot of data out there on this there could find other than this one so let just go ahead and cover it and this is titled the influence of dietary fat on liver fat accumulation okay I link down below so you can check it out it to kind of go through it since we identified that protein and cholesterol consumption were associated with elevated risk whereas consumption of carbohydrates was associated with a decreased risk of hospitalization or death related to cirrhosis or liver cancer so they didn fatty liver they kind of stuck in the cirrhosis and liver cancer so I don really know if they fatty liver or cirrhosis or cancer but they did say that they identified protein in cholesterol consumption okay so we association between cholesterol intake and cirrhosis or liver cancer I don know why they are not saying a fatty liver is potentially our studies most important finding now in rabbits and in mice a high cholesterol diet has been shown to induce a fatty liver inflammation and fibrosis all right they did bring that up a high cholesterol diet will cause a fatty liver inflammation and fibrosis in rabbits and mice okay alright so I need to bring up what these mice and rabbits ate okay that cholesterol high-fat diet really was a high cholesterol and fat / - sucrose it was high in malta dextrose and it was high in dextrose itself which is a synthetic sugar okay so anytime you mix sugar with fat you fatty liver so it wasn fat diet with low carb so the problem is no there what a high fat diet is in these studies that is a big problem and then as far as the rabbit I couldn get the exact formula but what I did find is they put the rabbit on peanut oil corn oil coconut oil sucrose and corn starch okay so we know that which again it and if they did they would probably get a lot of liver problems okay we are not aware of any other human studies linking cholesterol intake to human liver disease Wow this is the only one I guess our finding that dietary cholesterol but not serum cholesterol was associated with cirrhosis or liver cancer could have profound implications if confirmed by other studies okay now I just want to bring up one point they cholesterol not serum cholesterol so in other words they found that people with high cholesterol in the blood did not create these problems it was not associated with these problems it was only the increase in intake but we all we already know what they the mice Chow the rabbit food was actually a high carb diet okay for example it could suggest that drugs blocking intestinal cholesterol absorption could have a more beneficial effect to the liver than drugs blocking hepatic cholesterol synthesis like I don drug thing now and they hinting that hey you know we can use drugs to fix this problem let are not aware of any studies investigating the effects of carbohydrate intake on the progression of liver disease in humans well there sure is a heck of a lot of studies out there and I will put the links down below showing that a high carb diet will affect the liver and actually even cause a fatty liver but it goes on to say this contrary to our findings in the recent study has found that patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease consumed two to three times more fructose than the controls which may be linked to the development of the fatty liver etc etc etc but it goes on to say our data did not allow us to determine the specific fructose intake so basically they said they then they actually they said there are studies but they didn fructose okay whatever alright we did not find any association between dietary intake of saturated fatty acids or the mono saturated fatty acids oleic acid and cirrhosis or liver cancer so that because I thought they said they did find it but I guess what they differentiating is they found high cholesterol diets might be apparently different than high saturated fatty diets this is really confusing because on one part of it talks about a high cholesterol diet and this says a diet high in saturated fat so there must be maybe two different diets that are using I have a no idea so this is a very confusing study and I really don lot of credibility in the study but to really imply that consuming high amounts of fat are gonna cause a fatty liver are misleading simply because the ketogenic diet is a low carb diet and this is the most important thing you need to know if you consume higher fats yet keep your carbs low you are going to be protected against getting if I deliver okay but if you actually add the carbs in here that is going to cause the problem because as you increase insulin from the carbohydrates okay what you is you fat cell to the point where it saturated and it more space there but then it spill off into the Orient the organs as well and that visceral fat and then with that you start developing a fatty liver so when you overwhelm the body with too much carbohydrate that carbohydrate that it not burned up needs to get stored and if there go in the liver and that behind a fatty liver and the reason I saying that is because when you put a person on a healthy keto plan you improve a fatty liver okay why because you lower the carbs you force the body to use its own store of fat so just think about what ketosis you the fat is turning into ketones okay so it mean if you had a failure liver wouldn you want to burn up the fat and use this stored fat as energy whether you consume more fat or less fat is really dependent on this carbohydrate amount all right guys thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications daily notifications that sounds weird well I on a daily basis how about that	Success

How To Get Rid Of Stomach Ulcer? Â Dr.Berg On Peptic Ulcer Treatment	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIAyFQNCGKk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys today we how to fix a stomach ulcer okay I had a stomach ulcer when I was in college it was very very painful and I was downing the tums like there I was eating these things buying the mega packs so I have a personal experience reality on what this feels like it okay when you think about it to actually have an ulcer eating away your stomach like a hole in your stomach it bleeding you know that problem you have to be pretty sick to get one of these things and I was very sick I a minute but first I wanted to differentiate between an ulcer and acid reflux okay or heartburn okay the normal pH of the stomach should be between 1.5 and 3 that you have a little valve on the top of the stomach right there if this pH starts to go higher which means more alkaline there are certain sensors in this valve that won acid will start splashing out this way and that acid reflux or indigestion it worse with food because the food will dilute this and then you start getting regurgitation that way but with an ulcer normally the food will coat this damaged area and make you feel better at least temporarily ok so I just wanted to make that differentiation so when you have an ulcer you have damage to the mucus layer which is a protective coating around the stomach and your body produces about 0.5 to 1.5 liters of gastric acids every single day and gastric acid is composed of hydrochloric acid potassium chloride and sodium chloride so you actually need potassium and sodium to help you digest okay now let causes of an ulcer one is H pylori okay I I did a separate video on this so I put a link down below if you want to get more data but this is a microbe okay that can actually create destruction and and hole in your stomach number two NSAIDs okay these are anti-inflammatories number three stress why because the nervous system that controls the stomach is called the autonomic nervous system and the primary system that dominates the digestive process is the parasympathetic so stress activates the sympathetic nervous system the flight-or-fight thereby inhibiting the parasympathetic I mean try to digest when you chased by a tiger or you it doesn when you okay then number four and this is interesting idiopathic now you may not know what this means but this means unknown cause well there tell you what I think the cause of this would be number one you know excessive alcohol will do it another condition called hypercalcemia too much calcium in the blood will cause an ulcer if you look it up you side effects but this is the big one right here refined foods okay especially when you vitamin E vitamin E protects the stomach from getting ulcers vitamin E is a very powerful antioxidant it also protects your arteries because if you think about it and also is oxidative damage to part of your tissues which means that you lacking certain antioxidants okay to help protect you and you you become susceptible when you consume refined foods without the antioxidant part okay and I accidents as a supplement talking about eating the foods with the antioxidants already in it like vegetables for example now people with ulcers will always have a deficiency of one or more of these nutrients b1 b2 b6 b12 vitamin C or folic acid all right now let to what you should take as a remedy to heal your stomach ulcer okay now of course I fasting absolutely that put a link down below if you don what that means but these are the four remedies that are very effective one cabbage juice there are certain compounds in cabbage that are great for healing ulcers and this has been thoroughly studied I down below now you may not do well if it sauerkraut because that might irritate this but if you juice the cabbage or even consume cabbage on a regular basis if you have an ulcer you will give you some relief okay chlorophyll is very very healing for a stomach ulcer where diga chlorophyll leafy greens wheatgrass juice powder licorice also has the ability to help heal ulcers and zinc carnosine okay this is a specific zinc attached to an amino acid that helps deliver the zinc into the stomach this is a really really powerful remedy right here so you can try one or more of these right here oh and I wanted to mention how I got my ulcer the combination of massive stress and only refined foods okay that only foods that I consumed I didn any chlorophyll in my diet I didn any anything green the only thing green that I ate was pistachio ice cream and lime green jello and that did not help I did not have any basic information on health at that time all right guys thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video so I want to thank you for being here and watching my videos if you haven already subscribed go ahead and do so so you can stay informed of future videos	Success

Consequences of a Fatty Liver that can Surprise You Â Result of Fatty Liver Disease Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4A3BaTrOOQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we consequences of a fatty liver that you may not associate with a fatty liver let you won your inflammatory markers go up not just in your liver but through the entire body the problem with that is will increase a condition called insulin resistance okay so then that that going to increase more insulin so insulin is going to create this problem but then this problem will create more insulin through creating this condition called insulin resistance if the inflammation is there too long chronic inflammation the liver you start developing scar tissue of the liver it start having some really big problems most liver problems are asymptomatic you don period of time until you start losing the actual function of the liver cells but you portion of your liver for certain things to show up like a site ease where you have this fluid in the gut that might not show up until like 90 percent of your liver is destroyed but the problem is that this can be brewing in the oven without you even knowing it a real good way to know if you have a liver problem is just look down and see if you have a gut if you do that means you have a lot of spillover or fat or visceral fat that because the liver is already filling up with fat that fat then causes inflammation and eventual scar tissue so the point is that you want to understand what couple things in your diet so you can actually actually reverse it because you can if you get it in time number three when you lose the function of the liver you lose the capacity of making bile because the liver cells parasites make bile and bile is necessary to dissolve and absorb the fat soluble vitamins and a lot of times people don dots between a lack of bile coming from the liver and their vision for example because they have a vitamin A deficiency or their lower mood because they have a vitamin D deficiency or they might have flaky skin or they might have really sore muscles after exercise that just won because they vitamin E can also can problems and angina or they might have little broken blood vessels from but lacking vitamin K and that all can come from this right here so when they consume those vitamins it doesn work because they don bile to help resolve it and pull it into the body so they also are not absorbing omega-3 fatty acids so this will show up in inflammation so they fish oil but they still have a key joints they still have pain in the body also they might not connect the dots with a thyroid being well because it takes a bio and a healthy liver to convert t4 to t3 the active form of thyroid hormones so they might notice their metabolism is slow things are sluggish they lost that vitality what happens when you lose the capacity of the liver you increase more toxins because you can with the help of bile you also start holding on to more estrogen one of the functions of the liver is to help get rid of excessive estrogen and cortisol so if you can start developing really soft skin and lose your body hair just from this alone this is why right here because the liver is losing function or increasing cortisol and you and number four a fatty liver will decrease testosterone so some people take the biochemical hormones but the real problem is coming from the liver number five they start developing metabolic syndrome might be pre-diabetic or diabetic high blood pressure high cholesterol and their focus on the heart not the liver the liver is the cause the heart is the affect belly fat that number one indicator for a fatty liver and heart disease as I mentioned over here so there cause a feather liver and one is called de novo lipid Genesis this basically is the conversion of carbs into fat in your body so when you do a high carb diet okay you start generating on a fad that starts depositing in your liver I put a link down below for more information about this but people with a fatty liver need to be on a low carbohydrate diet also the fructose high fructose corn syrup the corn syrup will create a fatty liver faster than any type of sugar alcohol will do it as well now there are two nutrients that are essential for a fatty liver one is choline because choline helps dissolve fat especially on your liver and by the way egg yolks have choline and vitamin E but don synthetic version get a natural version a complex that has half to cough rolls and half tocotrienols okay very very important this has been known to significantly reduce inflammation in the liver as well as in the arteries and also decrease the formation of scar tissue which eventually turns into cirrhosis but don taking these two unless you first get your diet corrected the diet I to recommend is the healthy version of ketosis and in a minute fasting together as one I put a link down below if you new to my channel so and then I would recommend taking these two and this will help you start reversing this right here alright thanks for watching so if you ahead and share it with someone that could really benefit from it	Success
What Causes An Abdominal Hernia? Â Dr.Berg on Hernia Causes	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyoJW3Rh31Y	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today I want to talk about some interesting information about hernias and what you can do if you have one so a hernia is a weakness within the collagen connective tissue or facha that is there to hold hold your body in a certain form okay now what would create this weakness one thing is something called glycated proteins okay what is that that condition where you molecule and a protein molecule together when this condition happens it makes the collagen very weak and susceptible to tearing increasing the risk of hernias aneurysm which is a weakness within the vascular wall and it creates a bulging effect which can break and also increase risk of getting a stroke from an aneurysm it makes the arteries really really stiff and the more stiff collagen is the more susceptible it is to crack and break okay so whether you collagen on a tendon a ligament or just the fascia around your abdomen this still applies so glycated protein can come from aging smoking but especially hyperglycemia okay now this is a situation where you have high sugar we pre-diabetes and as a side note the sugar fructose can create ten times more glycated protein than glucose now what interesting is that you would think that high fructose corn syrup has the most fructose but really high fructose corn syrup only has 55% fructose a hundred percent fruit juice has 65% fructose interesting and a gaba nectar is 95% fructose so you really want to stay away from fructose if you settle to getting hernias now you can develop glycated protein inside your body from having high sugar or you can actually consume glycated protein from certain foods so I want to explain the difference okay if your blood sugar is high especially over a period of time you start getting glycated proteins in the I creating all sorts of problems with the eye itself and circulation to the eye the lens of the eye which is protein the nervous system the brain the kidney the beta cell that actually produces insulin in the pancreas the vascular system around the heart but you could also consume foods that have these glycated proteins because when you heat sugar with a protein or even sugar with a fat over 248 degrees Fahrenheit you create these proteins and that would be in deep fried french fries donuts barbecued meats cake dark soda so as you can see the elephant in the room is right here hi sugar always comes back to this high sugar state and also make a note of this when you combine protein with sugar or a fat with sugar and you heat it up it actually a lot worse than consuming straight sugar alright guys thanks for watching and I so I want to thank you for being here and watching my videos if you haven already subscribed go ahead and do so so you can stay informed of future videos	Success

Â Stomach Acid & Allergies Explained by Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBttSj0kLqw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we connection between allergies and something going wrong in your stomach but it has to do with losing the acidity of the acid in your stomach normally the pH in the stomach should be between 1 and 3 that fact it your blood and the purpose of this acid is number one to help you digest protein and by the way to have a true allergy there must be a protein involved and when you have undigested protein that goes down into the digestive system and if you have at the same time leaky gut it goes right in and your immune system starts tagging it in appropriately and creating a hypersensitivity creating analogy number two it the acid helps sterilize microbes okay I viruses bacteria yeast fungus Candida so if you microbes in the food that you they should be dealt with at the stomach level and not allowed to go deeper through the system where they can create all sorts of problems all right number three it helps you absorb minerals and we need minerals for so many different chemical reactions in the body but if you can selenium zinc copper iron your immune system will suffer and that alone can increase the susceptibility to getting allergies and even asthma so if you really look up the data on low stomach acids one of the terms you up against is called hypo chloride riah okay and you symptoms that can occur from having low stomach acids one is gas indigestion burping bloating and right here allergies okay cause effect a deficiency of b12 increase Candida and then we have some a condition called SIBO small intestinal bacterial overgrowth where the microbes are growing in the small intestine instead of a large intestine and if your pH is too weak if your acid levels are too high too alkaline then it the microbes that could be invading and start growing into the small intestine and also acid reflux okay these are all the symptoms of low stomach acid here are some causes number one hypothyroidism number two a low salt diet why sodium chloride chloride is needed to make hydrochloric acid antibiotics and an acid also gastric by-pass can creates a situation because you the volume of the stomach and then have something called h pylori which is a microbial infection which can inhibit gastric acids and low amounts of vitamin b3 so all of these have the potential to weaken the acid or create a deficiency of acid in your stomach now one test you can do to determine your ph of your stomach is the heidelburgh test now when I was practicing in my clinic there was a test that we would do involving taking a little capsule with a string on it okay and you this capsule with some water and you would hold the string outside the mouth and it would actually go all the way down to the stomach and we side for about 15 minutes and then we pull up the string and then we would actually identify the ph of the little capsule okay so we can determine that and quite a few people who have these symptoms right here did not we even close to having a ph of one two three they were like a four or even a five which is interesting now I couldn find this test anymore I don where to get it so a much easier way to do this would be simply actually it even a lot cheaper to just to take the remedies to assume you have this and see if your allergies improve okay what are the two remedies betaine hydrochloride and apple cider vinegar these two remedies will help you acidify the stomach to reestablish the normal pH that you should have between one and three now in this video I get into dosages or how long you have to take it because I don situation so go ahead and just read the directions on the label and just go with that right now but the point is that if your allergies are being triggered by this situation and you take these you relief all right thanks for watching so I want to thank you for being here and watching my videos if you haven already subscribed go ahead and do so so you can stay informed of future videos	Success

5 Reasons for Cold Feet Â Hypothyroid, Low Blood Pressure, Diabetes & More Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbhKmW1Xt-U	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we may have cold feet okay so the first one is a hypothyroid condition because the thyroid controls metabolism so with metabolism everything is slowed down even the temperature slow down and you hands and your whole whole body will be cold not even necessarily the feet but it could definitely be the feet so if this is the case you have to find the cause of it because if you have an autoimmune condition for the thyroid that it gonna put a link down below of the different types of thyroid issues and what you would do for each one but this is one of the causes all right number two low blood pressure why because there body and there nutrients so if this is the case you may just need some salt okay especially if you notice you just started the keto program and you are cold well check your blood pressure if it you just add some salt that increases more volume because you have to also drink more water with that so you have more volume the fluid because when you do a keto diet you release a lot of fluid because all that carbohydrate retains fluid and sometimes you could end up with low blood pressure which is not a bad thing but you just need to add some salt and some fluids so you can then increase the volume of fluid going through your body and you a none improvement in the cold feet there it doing keto then we know you just need more salt very simple number 3 diabetes poor circulation high levels of sugar start destroying your proteins and create all sorts of sticky proteins that block blood flow into the feet and the hands and that can start creating this symptom of course if you fasting this should improve okay all right number four keto transition when you a minute fasting you may have some cold feet for a short period of time why because you shift and actually the thyroid is still trying to adapt to that so it may take a little bit of time for the thyroid to adapt to in a minute fasting and to the point where this cold goes away all right number five you there two types one would be b12 deficiency and an iron deficiency but I never recommend just taking iron as a supplement you want to get it from food grass-fed liver would be a good thing to take to handle both the iron and b12 and but the point is you want to find out why you because is it just that you eating these foods or could you have a problem with your digestive system let say for example you don stomach acid well that right there could be the reason why you can or you have a problem with b12 or let say you losing blood well in that case you just need to have some you know grass-fed liver and that should handle it right there if you don actually do rare meat that would actually handle it as well anyways I wanted to create a video of the five reasons why you may have cold feet thanks for watching so I want to thank you for being here and watching my videos if you haven go ahead and do so so you can stay informed of future videos	Success
How To Control Your Appetite After Meals? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIT1JDnIHU8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today I control your appetite especially after you eat enough here in the situation where you eat a meal and you satisfied you have to keep eating maybe something sweet do you have that well this video is for you there reasons why that can be one is you have low bile production what is bile bile is a kind of a detergent that helps you break down fat and extract fat soluble vitamins omega-3 fatty acids essential fatty acids from the food that you eat and it pulls it into the cell so it helps you absorb fat with the help of the pancreas so if your liver is damaged because the bile is made by the liver you may lose the capacity to make bile so if there amounts of bile you that you okay because fat helps you feel satisfied so that you don going to be low in bile so you maybe need to take bile after you eat okay so you just take a little tablet there some more information I have down below on that but you take one and that will actually help you number two low vitamin b1 if you have a b1 deficiency you safety centers in the brain so there certain parts of your brain that need b1 because b1 acts as a coenzyme to help that work and then that deficiency is going to create a lot of hunger and you but in a rare occasion you can have the opposite effect like you at all if you have a b1 deficiency but that most common cause of having an appetite that and that is called insulin resistance so if you look at the cells right here and then you have insulin insulin is the key that opens the door to the cell to allow the fuel and nutrients to go into the cell so if you have instant resistance you can you can the cell has certain yours in signals that will send signals back and let the brain know that okay stop beating right so if there signals you food you energy like sugar than anything so this is something that is created by high levels of insulin over a period of time and you guessed it it a period of time and frequent eating over time you start developing this condition and you this right here the way to reverse that is to cut down the carbs cut down the frequency of eating start consuming nutrients that are more dense you can have a large salad sings like that to get your potassium magnesium which will help reverse insulin resistance so try this simple experiment one day try eating a lot of refined carbs okay because there turn off that signal that eating signal and then the next day consume high nutrient foods let and you have salmon your body is going to turn off those hunger signals a lot faster so it calories to satisfy you it eating the right food it bile it food it and for those of you that are new I put a link down below of exactly what you should be eating to overcome this condition right here thanks for watching so if you ahead and share it with someone that could really benefit from it	Success
How To Get Rid Herpes Virus with Autophagy Fasting? - Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_E3gHsmZo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we to get rid of herpes with something called the toffee G which I in a second so herpes there different types it location of the body part you can have it in your mouth you can have it in your private parts it can even go into the brain it creates a lot of problems the herpes virus it travels through the sensory nerves and it can even hang out in these little nerve cell bodies called ganglia and these viruses can go out of remission and back in the remission back and forth with various things that can activate them stress sun chemicals and they can really make your life miserable however on a positive note there is something you can do about it and it fasting or in a minute fasting now fasting will do some very fascinating things in the body one is it will trigger a condition called a toffee g state where your cells are ridding abnormal proteins breaking them down with certain enzymes and recycling them okay so it it will also recycle damaged organelles organelles are like the mitochondria endoplasmic reticulum these different little parts of the cellular machinery that could be damaged and what amazing is that etapa G will also target microbes invading microbes the term is Zenith AG okay which xeno comes from the word foreign or strange and Fei Jie meaning eating so basically Zi know they G means a tapa G against a pathogen or a virus and what if you had herpes is that herpes travels to the nervous system and etapa G is more efficient and more effective on neurons more than other cells so it can be a very good tool to deal with this infection and I also think that when our bodies are sick we naturally lose our appetite which we do fasting as a mechanism to deal with the infection so there I would recommend number one is to start doing in a minute fast and number two I would also recommend certain natural antiviral compounds like mono Lauren this comes from coconut oil santé viral oregano which is antiviral olive leaf extract is antiviral garlic is antiviral now a couple points in in a minute fasting I would really recommend you do it gradual starting at 3 meals no snacks do that for a while and then graduate to two meals no snacks and then graduate to one meal eventually ok especially if you have a really bad situation with the herpes because I think this could give you a lot of relief now I for those of you that are new to namenda fasting may have a video down below that explains how to do it effectively etapa g starts being effective at 18 hours in your fast ok and it kind of maxes out at about 23 hours so if you were that recommending doing 2 meals and then down to one male to really get the full benefit of this anyway I put some links down below for some more research give it a shot see if it can help you thanks for watching so if you ahead and share it with someone that could really benefit from it	Success
Yeast Infection vs Candida Infection: Is there a Difference? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OOG5EMVads	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so recently I had a question from someone that wanted to know what is the difference between a yeast infection and a candida infection and a fungus infection there on these terms so let through this yeast is a type of fungus okay Candida is the most common type of yeast infection so basically Candida is a type of yeast and you have like 20 different types of Candida but it that becomes a problem or pathogenic normally we need this yeast candida and fungus in our digestive system and around our body it flora or microbiome we don friendly bacteria we have friendly east from the candida and friendly fungus okay so the location of this candida overgrowth can occur in the vaginal area the mouth under the breast nail bed armpits private parts it likes areas that are moist so the question is what creates this overgrowth situation well you guessed it antibiotics will do it sugar will do it because candida and yeast live on sugar it ferments certain types of sugar steroids stress will cause the overgrowth estrogen will cause the overgrowth and this is why women can get a yeast infection during certain times of their cycle and that of birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy and so I just did a video on this if you have estrogen dominance iodine seek help is the best remedy alright so now what do you do if you have a yeast or Candida infection well number one you want to increase the stomach acid it would recommend something called betaine hydrochloride okay I down below take that on a regular basis outside of vinegar is also very important you can get them in a tablet form garlic essential start consuming garlic in your food I about rubbing it on your body because it can burn just to just consume it in your food or take it as a supplement clove is a good remedy for that as well find a really good probiotic all right enhance the probiotic the flora of your gut okay and avoid the actual food that feeds these microbes avoid all sugar of all kinds all right I thank you for being here and watching my videos if you haven go ahead and do so so you can stay informed of future videos	Success

3 Weird Signs & Symptoms Of Fatty Liver Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz0-E6biHSw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we weird symptoms of a fatty liver okay let me first talk about the function of the liver and what it does that different functions these are the main ones it helps you make bile what that helps break down fast to the point where you can start pulling out of fat the necessary fat soluble vitamins the necessary essential fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids and then it doesn down a hundred percent just breaks it down to a certain degree and then the pancreas releases lipase which is the other enzyme that breaks it down even further so we now have the basic unit so we can start using these necessary elements from our food so they functional so if there and you can gonna have not just under nested fat but you of vitamins leading to a whole cascade of issues number two it helps you make proteins a lot of different types of protein lipoproteins which carry cholesterol as an HDL and LDL also protein in your blood the liver also makes cholesterol makes quite a bit like a thousand milligrams every single day the liver can also make glucose as in gluconeogenesis making new glucose and it can make it from fat or protein and it actually makes and helps you store glycogen what storage form of glucose it can turn ammonia to urea which is a less toxic substance ammonia is a byproduct of protein metabolism the liver helps you detoxify certain things chemicals poisons drugs and there enzymes called phase 1 phase 2 detoxification where you turning these fat soluble toxic poisons into water-soluble harmless particles so the body can get rid of them it also helps you buffer excessive hormones so if there much estrogen for example it can help regulate that too much cortisol it can actually help degrade cortisol so you don so it really does a lot very very important so what are the three weird symptoms of a fatty liver when you have a fatty liver you lose the capacity of the liver to function okay so one of the weird symptoms would be heart pain you wouldn associated with the liver but when you actually have fat in the liver and even cirrhosis the liver starts to enlarge to a certain degree and there of space in there so it can compress over to the heart especially if you laying on your left side because the liver is on the right side and the hearts on the left so if you lay down it can compress on that heart so it if you have this problem sleep on your right side it you get heart symptoms but the heart is fine have them check the liver alright number two gynecomastia what is that man boobs why do you get that because you can estrogen and it in a male body another symptom of too much estrogen would be spider veins as well all right number three night blindness now night blindness is a vitamin A deficiency how would you become deficient about M&A well you actually not making enough bile because the liver makes the bile the gallbladder stores the bile if you don you can is not just involved in night blindness it you just poor and it problem all right here symptoms of a fatty liver high cholesterol decrease bile and what happens if you don can really the bile production that is necessary to regulate cholesterol belly fat and by the way I have five patients who I sent to the radiologist to get ultrasounds and five out of five had a fatty liver so if you have a gut you might want to get a scan and the scan I would recommend is called fiber scan Barbara scan is something that your doctor can do to assess not just a fatty liver but if there five gross okay it pick that up in certain levels I think it is not like any radiation so it safe all right next one diabetes so if the liver loses its capacity to help you with blood sugars this can be one of the results fatigue is a very common symptom of a fatty liver right shoulder pain and not just right on the right shoulder pain but in the right neck and the jaw and the back of the trap up here and the right rhomboid in the back part by your scapula to the right of your midline of your spine it seemed okay so on the bottom of the feet and the palms of the hand you can get redness in the palm of the hand as well confusion irritability why because you have blood sugar issues bad breath okay so that symptom alright there things I want to bring up about a fatty liver number one gastric bypass can increase your risk of getting a fatty liver especially if you don enough bile which I think that reason because they digestive system to a certain degree extreme low protein diets can cause a fatty liver now you would think would be just the opposite but if you on protein the body could actually create fat in the liver which is interesting certain drugs steroids tamoxifen there drugs that can create a fatty liver viruses can create a fatty liver but the most common cause of a fatty liver is high levels of insulin because the person is consuming too many carbohydrates okay if you channel I put a link down below of exactly what eating plan you should be on to reduce your carbs so you can get the fat out of the liver and there vitamin that a fatty liver and that is choline okay choline actually can help you take the fat off the liver I below on a video where I talk about choline thanks for watching hey guys real quick I have a new healthy keto eating

7 Tips To Lower Blood Pressure Naturally Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YFXiowjS1c	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we things you can do to lower your blood pressure an extremely high blood pressure would be we have the systolic and the diastolic and by the way systolic is the contraction of the heart diastolic is the relaxation and it has a lot to do with something called the autonomic nervous system where you have the flight-or-fight it rest and digest parasympathetic which is the recovery in it system that helps calm things down so we have a balance of those two parts of the nervous system that are on automatic so we be 180 systolic or greater than that or greater than 110 diastolic high stage one would be 160 to 179 systolic and diastolic would be 100 to 109 high stage to be 140 to 159 systolic 90 to 99 diastolic normal high 139 to 121 systolic and 81 to 89 diastolic in normal 120 to 80 the important thing to know is that if you get high blood pressure just one time it check it through the day and see if it consistent so the worst situation is that if your blood pressure is high all the time it never comes down and that just means that your arteries are very stiff and they fluctuating here and there that better situation to handle there are seven things that I would recommend starting with you guessed it alpha keto Y carbohydrates in general retain a lot of fluid and what common medications that they use for blood pressure diuretics they rid of excess fluid you go in keto you there comes the blood pressure just by going on a low-carb diet in a minute fasting vital to decrease inflammation in your arteries okay also the combination is very very important to take the stiffness out of the artery itself number three decreasing cortisol wets cortisol cortisol is a stress hormone from the adrenal and if the adrenals are involved and the cortisol is too high what gonna go high first before the diastolic conditions of high cortisol like Cushing pressure but you systolic go high first and you just want to lower stress okay go for long walks eliminate as much stress as possible I have videos on this in fact I link down below for one of them that involves a stress webinar that I did that will really help you reduce your body stress number for taking vitamin d3 vitamin D actually will help lower your blood pressure your vitamin D deficient blood pressure tends to go up they don why it does that one theory is that the regulation of calcium supports the sympathetic nervous system in a certain way but it actually will lower your blood pressure now increasing vitamin k2 what is vitamin k2 it k1 and this vitamin helps to remove excess amounts of calcium from your arteries and puts it in the bone so these two together combined are really important in lowering blood pressure can number six this is probably one of the more important ones increasing your potassium there written by several medical doctors that involve taking larger amounts of potassium to drop blood pressure with incredible success if you potassium your blood pressure will go up one of the main functions of potassium is its ability to be a physiological tranquilizer and just calm the nervous system right down so it if you pressure goes up and guess what creates potassium deficiency refined sugars in carbohydrates all right last one is increasing magnesium if you in magnesium your muscular system the muscles within the vascular system are going to be tight and the blood pressures going to go up and it just so happens that the foods that are high in magnesium are also high in potassium like in leafy vegetables okay so these are the seven things that you can do to lower your blood pressure thanks for watching so if you ahead and share it with someone that could really benefit from it	Success
Hidden Side of Clinical Research Trials Â Paid Research Studies & US Department Of Health Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmMBvDorRVY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys today we research studies and their dirty little secrets okay now when people want to find the truth of something they want to find some science they want to see some scientific study researched published that will validate the claim that is made about it right now what you need to realize is there are several really big problems in the area of research one question that I had was why is it that the industry sponsored studies always seem to be positive like the studies done by drug companies they always come out to be really good why is that and the answer is this they had the option to publish what they wanted they could cherry-pick what data that they wanted to publish and omit certain studies that didn certain studies that gave side effects to make it look really good and this would also explain why so many drugs in the past were all of a sudden founded to create all these problems in society and then there was all sorts of class-action suits that eventually caused that drug to be taken off the market like let just take DES for example diethylstilbestrol be used for 30 years until they found it it actually caused serious serious problems birth defects infertility and the list goes on and on but in 2005 the US Department of Health established a new rule which increased transparency so drug companies now are forced to publish all of their data not partial studies all of their data now one of the problems is getting them to comply with it because based on a survey that I saw it was like 97% of them said they would comply but when you look at their policy records they say they will consider it okay but whether they do or whether they don that you can go to to supposedly see all the data it now in 2018 dr. dubrow compiled all the data on statins before 2005 and after 2005 and he wanted to look at what was the actual benefit of mortality did it provide any benefit to help people to live longer and he found absolutely no not once Ingle benefit of increasing your life in any way shape or form so all this powerful data this evidence that so many doctors were relying on to show the positive benefits of taking a statin will improve cardiovascular function so basically it did not show the benefits that they were claiming and there lot of other similar findings with psychiatric drugs for depression as well another little dirty secret that I want to talk about is something called the run-in period which basically allows the study to extract delete the first six weeks of data based on non-compliance now I show you what that actually means what why would someone non comply to study right well you guessed it side effects lots of side effects so they have the option of taking that initial data for six weeks out of the study and then like starting a study after you eliminate these side effects you think that might taint the results of the research and then there is just the structure of the study itself over 1 million articles that were published since 1946 regarding diet and health used questionnaires these are memory based methods ok they variables you question here about what they ate in the last year and you sorts of random things not to mention they diet which affects their memory in the first place so the next time you watching the news or reading something online and they mention quoting a study see if it it only find good studies that we but to interpret them correctly because it takes time you have to have a medical dictionary sitting beside you and also read the actual study not an interpretation of the study secondhand and one last point I want to bring up is this if you example a diet or some nutritional recommendation it out on yourself to see if it works for you and that way you don for the next governmental study that they tell you exactly what to eat and what not to eat thanks for watching hey guys real quick I have a new healthy keto eating plan for you just go to dr.

How To Relieve From Post Hysterectomy Depression? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRTdoBmU8_g	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys today we post hysterectomy depression so let say for example you for some reason had to get hysterectomy for if there was fibroids or endometriosis or something like that let body and what to do to counter either depression or anxiety or even hot flashes so in the body how the hypothalamus and your the pituitary the master gland another gland that the middle man to the other glands and so you have this entire pathway here that then goes down through the body goes down to the adrenal glands goes down to the ovaries and we have this feedback loop going on so the endocrine system is a series of glands and hormones that are basically a sophisticated communication system they send communication they receive it and they transmit it so when you have hysterectomy it the body it now sometimes we out the ovaries so let take out the ovaries and the uterus so what happens now these pathways are in confusion so thank goodness you have a back-up organ which are the adrenals the dream ills do make the same hormones that the ovaries make so here thing the adrenals were not designed to produce the same amount of hormones to the ovaries they only produce a small fraction so we usually have an overcompensating adrenal gland situation where we have a spike in cortisol and we have a severe loss of hormones down here specifically progesterone and estrogen and that depression and anxiety together so what can you do there can do first thing I would recommend is make sure you take enough vitamin d3 better yet get Sun every day about at least 45 minutes would be great because vitamin d3 is very good for depression and to bring up your mood and it acts like a hormone in the body more than just a simple vitamin so it works beyond just calcium metabolism and bone it actually works on your mood as well the next thing I would recommend is progesterone cream very very important and it will actually bring the person out of depression many times just that alone now the big focus should be though on the adrenals because the dream ills are overwhelmed at this point so anything you can do to minimize stress and support the adrenals would be good I have a video down below of it webinar that you can check out and learn about to extract stress from the body but there recommend I would recommend getting the oil that is completely a hundred percent free of THC okay and just to make sure what I would do if I were you is I would contact the company and have them send you via email proof that it was tested and it is THC free but this oil has special properties to help balance out the entire endocrine system to help support the adrenals to help support healthy course all levels it for insulin resistance and it can help next thing I B vitamins through nutritional yeast but specifically vitamin b1 this will greatly help alright guys so that I would recommend for this condition hey guys real quick I have a new healthy keto eating plan for you just go to dr.

Shrinking Testicles and Man Boobs Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBUr89EVoWc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	all right so in this video we to talk about shrinking testicles and man boobs okay now there called hypogonadism where you have atrophy of your gonads your testicles and that actually comes from liver damage whether it inflamed liver which reduces the function or more commonly a liver that filled with scar tissue that now when you have a damaged liver you inhibit the receptors for growth hormone growth hormone is made by the pituitary it and then it triggers another hormone called igf number one that is basically made by the liver and you that growth hormone to connect to the liver because the receptors are not receiving and also you production of igf-1 in general and that is going to reduce testosterone because igf normally stimulates testosterone production and when testosterone goes down you have a spike in estrogen okay now there actually injected igf in men to reverse testicular atrophy okay at least short term so we can see this effect of igf on testosterone but that comes with a package there other side effects also alcohol increases the toxicity of the gonads as well i think because if there you can detoxify alcohol like you should and that builds up toxicity so when you have a reduction of testosterone you have loss of libido you effects like man boobs and a reduction in sperm okay and you also have the androgens in your body not just in the liver but to the entire body being converted over to estrogen through a certain enzyme all right so what is the solution do you take certain herbs to stimulate the production of testosterone or maybe testosterone replacement therapy well what about just fixing the liver okay that gets to the root because every time you uh take a hormone for example your body will then not have to produce so that creates more hypogonadism so how do we repair the liver okay well the liver is unique and then it has amazing reparative properties okay it can bounce back if you know what to do now in this situation where you have your actual testosterone being converted to estrogen you can take an enzyme blocker and and that would be like stinging nettle root that would be one so stinging nettle root is a really good inhibitor of aromatase and this will stop this production of estrogen in the body now the next thing to consider is time a lot of times people in their mind think it process so the liver is a very large organ so it does take time so you patience and realize that the time it takes to repair the liver it could be a few years okay so i don idea that oh yeah it two weeks and it everything quite a bit of time all right second point we want to stop the things that are causing the problem in the first place and yes that does include alcohol alcohol is going to worsen the problem in the liver you right now if you want a good substitute i recommend kombucha tea make sure the sugar is really really low you also want to avoid junk food and you want to increase the quality of food organic meats organic vegetables because all those pesticides and chemicals make things worse now you may have been watching my other videos and you know about keto but if you don i put a link down below you need to get on a healthy version of the ketogenic diet that way we can reduce the carbs in the sugar reduce the stress and start repairing the liver not to mention help to take the fat off the liver as well all right the next point is choline choline is a very essential nutrient to help take the fat off of a liver it has properties of improving liver function it does a lot for the liver so you want to get a good choline supplement and start taking that as well as vitamin e and vitamin d get vitamin d3 and as far as the vitamin e goes make sure you get a nice food concentrate something that has a combination of tocotrinols and tocopherols not a synthetic version of vitamin e vitamin e is very protective of the liver and vitamin d3 is also beneficial to the liver as well now phytonutrients that come from leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables are chemoprotective so they do have certain compounds that are not just anti-cancer but they detoxification enzymes it does a lot for the liver so a lot of leafy greens would be very beneficial and then number five good amount of exercise exercise can actually really increase the blood flow and also it helps stimulate growth hormone as well and by the way this next thing intermittent fasting is probably one of the most powerful things you can do for the liver because it can actually increase uh growth hormone and if you have scar tissue in the liver or cirrhosis it can help repair that through an action called atapa g i put a link down below for more information about that so if we do the intermittent fasting correctly on top of all these we can repair the liver function and start to regain the testosterone by improving the actual function of the gland itself so we target the cause of this problem to improve the many downstream consequences that this will create all right thanks for watching hey guys real quick i have a

How To Put Multiple Sclerosis (MS) In Remission? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN8KmYAlass	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so in this video I want to talk about some very interesting data on and that multiple sclerosis and it Cobras protocol okay so I learn a little bit more about this medical doctor but it fascinating not just for MS but for all autoimmune problems what he found is if you use high doses of vitamin d3 you can see some serious improvements in autoimmune conditions and as far as high doses we so I weigh 180 pounds so I would be taking eighty one thousand I use FD three now the big concern for people is that oh my gosh I calcium in my blood it hypercalcemia and these are the symptoms increased thirst urination stomach pain constipation nausea confusion depression heart rhythm problems but as I go through this I solve that problem now what about d3 well the first thing you need to know is that there of MS and locations that have more sun based on the latitude aboard you live big clue right there also if a pregnant female either takes vitamin d3 or exposed to more Sun before she delivers that child has a less chance of developing things like asthma and different autoimmune conditions down the route so vitamin D is a immune modulator it actually controls and regulates the immune system every single immune cell has a receptor for vitamin D here problem in our population there actually four different mutations or alterations in the vitamin D receptor what does it mean it means that a certain percent of the population cannot absorb vitamin D too well in which case they would need to consume a lot more to create the same effect and there of research going on in this area but vitamin D is influences over 3,000 genes so it does a lot so you can read more about the protocol but one thing about vitamin D is when you increase vitamin D you decrease the parathyroid hormone okay because the parathyroid hormone kind of regulates calcium metabolism and it has a feedback loop when you you have an increase in parathyroid hormone and there also has some interesting connections between having a hyper parathyroid gland and developing or triggering autoimmune diseases which is interesting but what you do is you take a blood test and you would measure your parathyroid hormone before you start the protocol and then you would measure it after you start the protocol if the parathyroid hormone decrease after you vitamin d3 that means it and you need to take more vitamin d3 again you can read some more about the details in this link down below but you would also take DHA which is a type of omega-3 fatty acid you would also take zinc and this is very very important but vitamin k2 vitamin k2 prevents the accumulation of calcium and you to take the mk7 version a hundred micrograms for every 10,000 IU vitamin d3 that would be the ratio that you would want to take and that will keep your calcium in check because you process as well and you taking calcium that way we can keep the calcium from being a problem and we get the benefit from vitamin d3 also take magnesium which also helps absorption of vitamin d3 choline b2 b12 folic chromium and selenium the other thing that he recommend is to drink more water like two and a half liters because if there is any concentration of calcium we don that turning into a kidney stone so he recommended drinking more water so I gonna talk more about this vitamin D in future videos but it and if you have MS you definitely need to know about this protocol thanks for watching so if you content go ahead and share it with someone that could really benefit from it	Success
7 Signs You Are Not Drinking Enough Water Â Dr.Berg On Dehydration Symptoms & Water Retention	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecw1-uPbfOk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	all right what are the seven signs that you I drinking too much water but there is such a thing as dehydration as well so yes you need to drink when you thirsty but there are other indications that tell you that you need to drink a little bit more okay if you are a stone former or you stones you need to drink a little more water because it it with the Ox let all together that form the stone if you have more fluid in there that would decrease the risk of getting this Jones number to low blood pressure especially on keto because with keto you lower your carbs you get rid of all the excess fluid and sometimes people don enough salt and the volume the fluid goes down so they might end up with low blood pressure and get number seven lightheadedness okay so you always want to if you get lightheadedness just check your blood pressure and then just drink more water and more salt very simple I see this too with people that consume too much potassium without the sodium that can deplete the water as a diuretic and then if you don sodium is a thing that helps you retain the fluid so you do need about a thousand milligrams of sodium per day as a requirement if your urine is really dark you see this on keto as well you don you want it like a straw color but you don really good a good way to know if you drinking enough water number four the skin pinch test I did a video on this I you just basically pinch your skin and see how fast it comes back okay the elasticity someone who print pinch it and it just stays there for a period of time so you wanted to come back within seconds okay all right dry sticky mouth it could mean you dehydrated number six you after you consume vegetables what interesting what I can assume I salad I get really thirsty why is that it is simply that these vegetables have fibers that retain fluid okay and if you don potentially it could be constipating because you might not have the same ability for that fiber to form into the gel that already mentioned this which is connected to low blood pressure alright guys so in summary you do want to pay attention to your thirst but these are some other indicators that may mean that you need a little bit more water thanks for watching hey guys real quick I have a new healthy keto eating plan for you just go to dr.

What Causes a Leaky Bladder? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1mwm5QQvgg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we bladder okay but not just leaky bladder frequency of urination urgency to urinate retention of urine and a leaky whether it laughter sneeze etc it related to a neurogenic bladder because the bladder is controlled by the nervous system it system especially the sphincter or the valve that controls the release of urine so the autonomic nervous system controls pretty much all the valves in the body even including the valves in the eye that allow light to go in and out it like an aperture or a little kind of a circular muscle that can open and close the same thing in your bladder and the tone of the entire bladder itself is controlled by the autonomic nervous system so so if your bladder tends to spasm versus it loses its tone and becomes flaccid that could be related to the autonomic nervous system so if you are a diabetic your risk of having a leaky bladder goes up by 200% interesting why is that well I think the reason is because when you you lose one of the most important nutrients that supports the autonomic nervous system which is thiamine which is b1 so I of another study that shows the link between thymine improving bladder symptoms okay and also one of the ways that someone becomes thiamine deficient is just by having too much sugar in the blood because when you b1 [Music] the nerves in the body and neuritis neuropathies and definitely the autonomic nervous system which by the way originates in certain parts of the brain but there also as other B vitamins involved could be b12 b6 so one of the things I would recommend if you have a leaky bladder is to take some b1 and also take the whole complex as in nutritional yeast and see if it can help you and you just might be very surprised of how much relief you can get for these symptoms right here thanks for watching so if you ahead and share it with someone that could really benefit from it	Success
12 Ways You Can Get Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) Deficiency Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbFmzRm-Liw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I have a lot of videos in button p1 and I if you don you gonna have problems with your memory but you body heart issues edema fatigue what acidosis where your breathing is affected restless leg syndrome and you can have all sorts of dangerous consequences just from that alone because of its importance I want to talk about all the different ways you can become deficient that go beyond just a diet let one consuming refined carbohydrates as in breads pasta cereal crackers biscuits things like that because the more refined that carbohydrate is the more be one you need to metabolize that carbohydrate and this is why they enriched those grain products with synthetic b1 alcohol is a real big one okay the more alcohol you drink the more deficient b1 you high levels of cortisol will deplete a vitamin b1 and of course sugar having high blood sugar from consuming sugar and that always deficient in b1 and they have complications of peripheral neuropathy because anything related to inflammation of the nerve destruction of the myelin sheath around the nerve you want to look for in b1 deficiency in addition to that you can also have problems with the nerves and other parts of the body that are affected like the inner ear so you might have hearing loss ringing in the ear you might have problems with the nerve to the eye the retina for example as in diabetic retinopathy which you could go blind from that vitamin b1 protects the nerves against the damage of the high-sugar then we have gastric bypass so if you alter either the stomach or the small intestine you limit the absorption of vitamin b1 vomiting will create a deficiency of b1 having an infection will deplete your b1 antibiotics like in flagyl or cipro will deplete your b1 diuretics will do it and as a side now diuretics will deplete all the water soluble vitamins not just beat complex but vitamin C as well in addition to the minerals like potassium metformin will deplete vitamin b1 increasing your chances of getting lactic acidosis what they have a blackbox warning that one of the side effects on taking metformin is lactic acidosis because it could be deadly even though it comes from the v1 deficiency you can actually get rid of lactic acidosis within 24 hours just by taking diming genetic defects that affect the transportation of b1 if you have that condition it that can cause a deficiency as well white rice and that specifically white rice you can lead to something called berry berry which is a severe b1 deficiency and it can create so many conditions especially with certain parts of the brain there condition involving a b1 deficiency in the brain which targets the mammillary bodies where the mammillary bodies actually start shrinking and there connection between that brain structure and producing new memories so if you find that you could remember the old stuff but new things are difficult that could be that situation like say for example you can three days ago or where you put your keys and one last point I always recommend keep taking b1 in its natural form and unfortified nutritional yeast is a good source and if you take it you goes down and you might just start having more energy because b1 is intimately involved in helping you make energy alright thanks for watching so if you ahead and share it with someone that could really benefit from it	Success

Before You Get Your Ovaries Removed: WATCH THIS!

Getting Up To Urinate Several Times At Night? Â Dr.Berg On Frequent Urination At Night	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_WDK-Sh9aw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so you getting up several times of the night having a urinate this video is for you now this is mainly for men but if you but just ignore the part when I talk about the prostate the first thing that you need to understand is the mechanism behind this condition okay and it easy to fix you should not have to get up several times a night it unnecessary and if you do what I to show you you sleep the whole night and not have to get up at all okay the mechanism what happens is the bladder has smooth muscle around it okay it has a muscle that contracts and relaxes this particular problem is a situation we are not able to eliminate all of the urine the tone or the muscle tone of the bladder is not Foley contracting to eliminate all the urine it contracts partially but there urine that within one to two hours later it activate a sensor that tell you to get up and eliminate that small amount of urine and it just keeps going on and on and on so it the muscle it nerve that connects to the muscle it problem with the sympathetic nervous system now real quick and this is important the sympathetic nervous system is normally considered a flight or fight stress situation right and the parasympathetic nervous system is all about rest and digest so when you resting you control okay and it just so happens that the smooth muscle that causes contraction of the bladder is underneath the parasympathetic now let me just clarify what I because you would think that the contraction that muscle would be under the sympathetic yeah but it under the parasympathetic because when you urinate you can stress State okay you be very hard to eliminate you have to be fully relaxed and calm to eliminate that urine from the bladder and when that bladder fills up okay and it has a normal tone that the sympathetic nervous system so regarding the bladder when you have too much sympathetic okay we just don don can that urine so this problem really is a sympathetic dominant problem and it caused by too much insulin insulin triggers a sympathetic nervous system okay and activates it and that behind this urination problem insulin enlarges the prostate and many times people think it that not because when men have their prostate removed many times they still have the bladder problem it can be part of the problem because the prostate is just underneath the bladder and if it enlarges it can obstruct this little tube that the urine actually is coming out to this tube right through here and one of the medications they use to try to help this problem or manage it it called an alpha blocker okay alpha blockers target the sympathetic nervous system now whether you have any of these symptoms difficulty urinating straining incomplete elimination of the urine in the bladder or dribbling what you need to do is lower insulin what causes high insulin insulin resistance I just have to explain this I explain to some very simple terms insulin is a hormone that lowers blood sugars insulin goes into receptors in the cell the body does not like to have too much insulin it likes to have normal insulin if there a period of time it will protect itself by creating blockage within the receptor it insulin resistance is a protective mechanism against excessive amounts of insulin here cell there detects low insulin it sends a signal to the pancreas tell the pancreas to make more insulin if you have instant resistance you have between five to seven times more insulin than a normal person all that excess insulin is going to create this problem okay loss of tone in your bladder and enlargement in the prostate so now the question is what do we do about it what you do is you lower insulin by cutting down the carbohydrates that you sugars if you day if you sugar you need to get that out of the diet now I do have a link down below that I highly recommend that you click so you can learn how to do this it called healthy keto but what important is fasting in a minute fasting why because fasting decreases the sympathetic nervous system it fixes sympathetic dominance it powerful tool in fact I don the lowering of carbohydrates will be enough to fix this problem but the combination is going to be very powerful but you of course you don in a minute fasting without lowering your carbs either you want to do both of them so how do you do fasting very simply you don hungry in the morning if you hungry you don in the morning they either breakfast they think it of the day that you get up you try to go as long as possible without eating if you hungry don when they start out have their first meal let okay if your first meal and in the link down below I eat so just check that out okay you can you can download that whole program the check your first meal and then you go all the way to maybe six or maybe seven o you have two meals a day the key is don you can you eat you increase insulin so it it so this is step one do this for maybe a few days or a week okay and then you graduate to stage two which is basically gonna push your first meal full word as long as you can two maybe three thirty okay 3:30 or 4:00 that would be the ideal situation your first meal 3:30 4:00 o you do this initially you like oh my gosh I day am I gonna starve the whole thing everyone goes through that it going to be a problem you can have a big meal it that first meal and then the second meal you you hungry but maybe in the first day or so that you second meal maybe a few hours later so you have these two meals and then you don you do this really big meal later in the day like this you are not going to be hungry from this point on okay now it be great if you could just stop beating from that point on and just do one meal a day because not only will you fix this bladder problem but you rid of the any type of extra fat in your stomach that would be perfect but some people I know this is hard to believe do have a problem snacking at night they have to eat something at night so for those people I suggest you have this first meal at 3:30 or 4:00 okay make it big and then as your second meal do it make it as a snack pistachios not popcorn pistachios okay that could be your second meal have some of those even at 7 or 8 o basically one and a half meals okay and that would be your pattern of eating that way you wouldn would have to give up something it would make it a lot easier ideally and be great if you didn if you had to do that and then let you do that at nine o fast all the way to the next day until 3:30 4:00 that problem do it for two weeks okay and watch the results comment below let me know your progress and thanks for watching so if you content go ahead and share it with someone that could really benefit from it	Success

Â Dr.Berg on Computer Vision Syndrome	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWXNclfUntE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	did you realize that your computer could be destroying your vision an average person will spend over seven hours in front of their computer and digital devices and I probably spend maybe 12 hours a day in front of my computer so this can really affect your vision and it could affect your vision from several mechanisms okay one is the LED light this artificial light is not full-spectrum it is very specific to a blue light which is a short high-energy wave which is very irritating to the eyes and LED lights can actually raise cortisol they add stress to the body just like the other lights that you have in your house that are florescent that can increase cortisol I would highly recommend that you replace some of your lighting system around your office with a full-spectrum bulb that can actually decrease some of the effects from the blue light also I would recommend getting some eyewear that can filter out the blue light at least 50% of it and you just a lot less strain when you actually on your computer I would just get the one that is just a filter for blue light all right the next point is the ciliary muscle of the eye so here the eye right here and here there ciliary muscle there on both sides that help to shape the lens to help you focus so you can focus in near or far now when you close up the ciliary muscles are in a state of contraction can you imagine contracting your muscle for seven hours that would create a lot of fatigue wouldn what being abnormally shaped because of the imbalance in the contraction and relaxation so here go outside at least a half hour a day and start looking at objects in the distance okay I do this all the time I go for a long walk but when you walk sometimes I have earphones you cell phone they they to do is you want to just look at objects in the distance okay for at least a half hour or a more that simple it the eye the last point I want to bring up is carotenoids okay carotenoids are phytonutrients there certain pigments in certain colored vegetables cruciferous it it use the carotenoids to protect against certain light sources like the Sun well when you have enough carotenoids in your body it can also help protect the eye against the UV radiation from the Sun as well one thing I noticed is a lot of people wear sunglasses when it all the time and that realize that you need some Sun that goes into the I not like staring at the Sun but enough Sun to help recharge the pineal gland you sleep better you might want to try that if you have a habit of wearing sunglasses all the time alright guys that watching so if you want to get notified with all my content click the notification bell next to subscribed	Success
Could Tremors Be Just a Vitamin Deficiency? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30khOXUP2Qk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	alright guys today we about tremors and vitamin deficiencies so there resting and essential resting could come from Parkinson the brain and essential which means unknown they don other parts of the neurology but they don the brain as well essential is eight times more common it mainly happens upon initiation when you something let and it could be of the head shaking the torso shaking your legs shaking whereas resting tremor is not as much on activation but just an arresting state you have this rhythmic movement of your hands or one hand and an essential tremor you have this progressive nerve damage now for Parkinson several videos on this realize that insulin resistance plays a huge part in this problem okay and this is why you want to get on a healthy keto plan you want to do in a minute fasting for sure why because this will produce a top ajit which is the repair action of your cells through recycling damaged proteins especially in the brain you can grow new brain cells especially part of the brain where there problems with dopamine and I did a separate video just on dopamine when you lower insulin you can improve dopamine because you brain that make dopamine now also if you add vitamin D in there you can also improve insulin resistance and also Parkinson friend who had Parkinson this guy he wasn see is just shuffling along he looks really old and he his tremors and dementia we recommend Kido in a minute fasting and several other things which I to in a second and he now he seen for his hand that these actions can greatly improve the symptoms from Parkinson I meant for education is not meant to replace medical care so check with your doctor before making these changes okay then we have essential tremors I would highly recommend doing research on the B vitamins if you look at b12 deficiencies you tremors okay so b12 has a lot to do with the nervous system and keeping the nervous system functioning you do tend to store b12 for a long periods of time but if you vegan or you have digestive issues and you have maybe IBS or Crohn or gastric bypass that could be more of the reason why you have a b12 deficiency in which case you need to take thousands of micrograms of b12 not hundreds so I would do like 2,000 micrograms of b12 every single day some people if they very deficient and they have a very serious illness need to be injected by b12 make sure that the version of b12 that you take is the methyl cobalamin which is the active form and it goes in a lot better than the other versions alright number 2 b1 very very important if you look at classical b1 deficiency is called beriberi it affects the brain and nervous system especially the myelin sheath the version of be one that I would recommend would be something called benfotiamine which is a fat soluble version even though it really nice and it doesn any side effects but it will penetrate the nervous system a lot better than the regular versions of b1 which are water-soluble also b3 deficiencies can also affect the neurology and create tremors if you I would probably take 500 milligrams of that and then b6 b6 is a very important cofactor in so many metabolic processes in the body I would recommend b6 as well and a blend of a nutritional yeast okay number three low vitamin E can affect the nerve and the muscle as well but specifically the nervous system so if you take a vitamin E make sure it synthetic make sure it combination between tocopheryl and tocotrienols okay that need because if your vitamin E deficiency that could be one reason why you have a tremor now caprylic acid from coconut oil is now being researched for tremors so that to consider as well alright guys thanks for watching I video so if you want to get notified with all my content click the notification bell next to subscribed	Success
How To Lower Blood Pressure Naturally by Cutting Out Sugar Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzYkM5DOTps	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys I wanted to show you a very interesting link in relationship to sugar and high blood pressure ok now I videos but this one blood pressure because here data I below for more information about this but when you consume sugar you actually trigger insulin insulin triggers the sympathetic nervous system so what is this in pathetic nervous system it part of the system that you have two parts you have the parasympathetic which is rest and digest and then we have a sympathetic over here which is flight-or-fight when you sympathetic dominant mode these are some of the symptoms you get high blood pressure lump in the throat cold extremities can that pulse rate dry mouth dry eyes nervous I already mentioned insomnia and anxiety so you have all these sympathetic dominant symptoms that actually come from insulin now what when you do the opposite of this when you go on keto we cut down the sugar we cut down the insulin guess what happens we enhance the parasympathetic we help the digestion we help the rest we help to sleep we take people out of adrenal stress mode and so when people tell you that keto puts your body in emergency state it you in a relaxed state and this is why people feel so good they feel calmer they actually their mood is elevated their inflammation goes down but the blood pressure definitely comes down and this is the reason why alright go ahead and try it out and see how it could work for you so if you ahead and share it with someone that could really benefit from it	Success
Let's NOT Fight the War Against Obesity Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU6ePvtFkSQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I wanted to create the video on this concept of fighting obesity okay and winning the war over obesity what actually does this mean anyway we have a war against obesity if you take a look at what they say it they exercise or they need to eat less calories how are we gonna fight genetics or people need more exercise so we gonna actually have a battle and force people to do that I mean this it doesn make sense or maybe we could just do more research and develop a pill or a drug to help you lose weight or block your ability to consume calories that might work right and they say it and you know we need more research we need more funding realize this guys this is a carefully crafted PR strategy to distract you from the real cause there is way way too much money involved 1.7 trillion that is just in the food and beverage industry alone they co-sponsored government research they have millions of dollars to lobbyists so it cause of the problem which is people are consuming excess sugar and they eating too frequently they many snacks or eating every three hours and that show you an average person consumes 31 teaspoons of sugar every single day in the US I countries but in u.s. we consume a lot of sugar the normal amount that our body should have would be one teaspoon of sugar okay but your body can actually make that from other things you don have to consume any sugar to have that one teaspoon of sugar so normal sugar is 82 this means okay one teaspoon of sugar in your blood but here you go to the doctor and your blood Sugar lot of sugar why is that because of insulin the hormone insulin is lowering your blood sugar so an average person has massive amounts of insulin in their bloodstream is it ever tested never you would have to do this test right here called Houma IR and that measures insulin and insulin resistance I highly recommend you you test that because if you struggling with weight especially chances are it goes on for a period of 10 years you have normal blood sugars but you have all the other complications you have a belly fat you might have a fatty liver you might get high blood pressure you might have high cholesterol you might have vision problems you might have tiredness after you eat you might have bladder issues you know trying to retain urine throughout the night because you 10 years you become a pre-diabetic why because you lose this function of insulin it doesn you resistance it becomes ineffective so your pre-diabetic okay and then you become a diabetic and so this is where your get treated right here but this is the first thing the curves right here this is why we converts carbs to fat okay it just turns the carbohydrates actually into fat so it much better way to win the war against obesity is to understand obesity and this right here is the simplicity of exactly what the obesity and now it genetics you more exercise you may need less carbohydrate calories you don pill and lastly it simple once you understand what causes it so don research coming down the pike with the cause of obesity and just focus on eliminating this right here and this will come to the normal range and you can start reverting some of these problems right here alright guys thank you so much for watching so if you want to get notified with all my content click the notification bell next to subscribed	Success
Why a Fatty Keto (Ketogenic) Diet Can Help Reverse a Fatty Liver Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgUdJBLo8-M	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so in this video I want to talk about why getting on a fatty ketogenic diet can actually help reduce fat on your liver now this sounds counterintuitive because you would think I fat it fat but what makes the ketogenic diet successful and I a conversion from the fat on your body to ketones which occur in the liver is the reduction of carbs for this to work you must reduce your carbs in fact you without without reducing your carbohydrates a lot of times when you see research on a high-fat diet which is no definition those studies are actually doing high fat high carb diets so you must reduce the carbs to get the person to burn ketones and the liver is the organ to do that and when ketones are produced guess what happens you automatically stop storing fat you stop dumping fat in the liver okay when you body is going to store glucose in the liver especially fructose and one really important point about this is that the liver is the first area to show a reduction of fat so when you start a ketogenic diet and you don reduction in your midsection what you have to realize is that your body is using up the liver fat first before it going to be using the visceral fat in your belly so don realize it if you have a lot of fat on your liver and if you have a large stomach you definitely have a lot of fat in your liver and what you need to know is that you can actually burn up a hundred grams of fat per day doing ketosis the point is that you just need to give it some time for it to really work and realize if you in your midsection it could be you have a lot of fat on your liver that the body is focusing on first bottom line is you can have significant fat reduction in your liver as well as a decrease in liver enzyme by doing the ketogenic diet real simply I would recommend three things one is getting the healthy version of the ketogenic diet this also means consuming more vegetables because you want that fiber to feed the microbes so the microbes can actually recycle more bile and the bile helps with the elimination of the excess fat through the gallbladder so that important point also in a minute fasting will greatly speed things up when you do intermittent fasting you are stimulating the production of ketones to a very high level so the combination of low carb and in a minute fasting ism is vital people can develop a fatty liver just from being deficient in this one nutrient choline and it the foods that are high in choline are fatty foods high in cholesterol fact the food that has the most choline is shrimp consuming shrimp and eggs for example can give you enough choline to prevent against a fatty liver it you have liver and peanuts meats scallops fish and leafy greens leafy greens and vegetables believe it or not have the lowest amount of choline and you can even take choline in a powder or supplement it dissolves fat on your liver to speed up the process alright thanks for watching so if you want to get notified with all my content click the notification bell next to subscribed	Success
Aluminum Toxicity and Silica	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bXVLTx4snw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so we aluminum toxicity and what you could do about it we aluminous very toxic to our bodies it in our water supply if you have a drip coffee maker you in baking powder cookware medications especially any acids deodorants and the big one vaccinations it that a child by the age of 18 months has been exposed to 4925 micrograms of aluminum it can lead to autism Alzheimer and bone problems like osteomalacia which is a weakening of the bones not quite to the level of rickets but a deficiency of vitamin D so there definitely a blockage of vitamin D when you have too much aluminum all right so that this silica water because silica has the ability to detoxify aluminum from your tissues and also it can prevent the build-up there research I put some links down below get a good filter start to eliminate exposure of aluminum and if you suspect you links down below check it out do more research in this area right here all right thanks for watching so if you want to get notified with all my content click the notification bell next to subscribed	Success
Fix Vitiligo With Copper	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qzn1MF7X5I	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I relationship between vitiligo and copper okay what is vitiligo it condition where your body is attacking certain cells that make melanin so without melanin you don pigment and you have these white spots so it so the way this works is you have a Milano site that makes melanin which is that gives you the pigment in the skin and it works through this conversion of an amino acid to a certain enzyme tyrosinase anything with an ace is an enzyme so you need this enzyme to be able to make melanin and to make this enzyme work you need copper so the entire structure of this enzyme which is a protein requires copper and many enzymes in the body require minerals as their cofactor helper nutrients now when you have too much of this enzyme you can get a hyperpigmentation of the skin and get dark spots or aging spots that what that is and there ki laters that actually pull copper out but vitiligo is an autoimmune condition okay so the body is making antibodies to attack itself so we have a lot of inflammation we have a lot of oxidation so we have a defective antioxidant system and the body is actually making too much hydrogen peroxide this is a very powerful oxidant and you can even try this at home put some hydrogen peroxide in your hair and see what happens now don it in your body that happening to your skin and the main antioxidant that rids this hydrogen peroxide uses copper and zinc so when you have too much hydrogen peroxide it can decrease this enzyme and if you have enough of this enzyme you can counter the hydrogen peroxide but in this situation we have these cells that are defective and we melanin in sufficient quantities so there can get a copper cream and put that directly on the skin to supply what your body needs to make this enzyme okay number two you can take some zinc because this is involved in this very powerful antioxidant start building up your defenses against this oxidation and number three vitamin d3 okay why vitamin d3 why is that good for vitiligo well it conditions but if you think about what is the medical treatment for vitiligo besides UV light or a photo therapy is corticosteroids like prednisone so they use prednisone and dealing with autoimmune conditions guess what vitamin d3 is it build up your body steroids and it immune regulator to help the immune system as well as decrease the inflammation involved in this condition so number one do the copper cream zinc and vitamin d3 alright thanks for watching so if you want to get notified with all my content click the notification bell next to subscribed	Success
The Benefits of Sweating	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrUui7S58uU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let sweating from exercise there benefits of sweating going to a sauna but I want to emphasize more of the benefits of sweating from actual exercise what person could actually lose two to four liters of sweat and at one hour time it sweat is composed of sodium potassium calcium magnesium these are the main electrolytes and chloride and some of the trace minerals copper iron chromium and urea which is a byproduct of protein and even lactic acid so when you sweat it air conditioner it thermal regulation it you down it your electrolytes and the advantage to that is that the average person is carrying around way too much sodium and in fact in America based on our diet we consume about a thousand milligrams more sodium than we really need and with that comes all sorts of issues which I into in the next slide and also sweating can increase your endorphins which can make you feel better it will decrease stress it will also enhance your sleep and the combination of an average person having way too much salt in their body and sweating out this sodium which by the way you can eliminate on average 900 milligrams of sodium every single hour and sometimes up to 2,000 milligrams of sodium in a given hour and when you sweating you of these other minerals at all it mainly gonna be sodium okay now let just talk about sodium for a second you need just the right amount of sodium you don don way when I not talking necessarily about salt salt is sodium chloride in this situation I talking about sodium of course I would recommend getting your sodium from sea salt that recommend one teaspoon per day of sea salt that will give you about 2,300 milligrams of sodium as well as chloride and you get 40% of a teaspoon is going to be sodium and 60% is going to be the chloride and you need that chloride to build your hydrochloric acid to help you digest but if you just keep it simple and just stick with one teaspoon of sea salt a day you average person if you carb diet you want to take less and I don but if you are doing high carbs the more salt you do the more fluid you retain unfortunately when people get their salt they usually get it in the form of like a salty chip a pretzel popcorn pizza they from things like olives or actual just sea salt but here are the symptoms of too little sodium fainting dizzy you get up too quickly and you feel dizzy low blood pressure weak muscles low tolerance to heat so let out of the heat working out and you just feel really really bad you can tolerate the heat that is basically low sodium and craving salt these are the indications of a sodium deficiency how do you know if you you you lose your calcium so you might get cramping and the calcium could accumulate in your kidneys and give you a kidney stone that could be one side effect or high blood pressure possibly it all depends on how much potassium you push to get everyone off of sodium but realize we need sodium we need this much per day the correct thing to do would be to supply this and supply the opposing mineral which is potassium okay and that comes from the leafy greens but getting back to the sweating there benefits of sweating from actual exercise that exercise to the point of sweating and maybe a little bit beyond and in the days that you intensively go on the long walks all right thanks for watching so if you want to get notified with all my content click the notification bell next to subscribed	Success
The Best PREDNISONE Alternative	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSwhSam_hLU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I prednisone alternative there few people taking prednisone and the problem is when you take too much of it it creates too many side effects so the point sometimes where you can at all anymore because it doesn anymore over 23 million prescriptions are given out every single year in the US alone so what is prednisone prednisone is a synthetic version of our own adrenal hormone called cortisol is a very powerful anti-inflammatory and it mainly given to people who have asthma allergies all sorts of skin issues from psoriasis dermatitis poison ivy pretty much every inflammatory condition of the skin pretty would give a person prednisone and inflammation and I talking about arthritis rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis tendinitis bursitis any of the itis is because prednisone works on inflammation autoimmune conditions prednisone is one of the main medications they give for lupus Hashimoto anti-inflammatory because the one of the main destructive elements of an autoimmune condition is inflammation so if you can remove that you can help the person hives okay which is inflammation the problem is when you take prednisone more than seven days you actually suppress your own body cortisol okay so it catch-22 because here you to create this anti-inflammatory effect but the body then doesn it so it goes into sleep mode so the actual side effects of prednisone are basically shutting down your own adrenal system and here are some symptoms cataracts bone loss diabetes which actually is interesting because the adrenal hormones are called glucocorticoids gluco referring to glucose because these hormones will turn your protein into glucose and if you have too much glucose you raise insulin and you can even have diabetes as a side effect and I actually have known of several patients who develop diabetes after getting a series of prednisone shots and of course weight gain and it in the midsection and adrenal atrophy where the adrenal glands basically shrivel up and they stop working so if you look at the adrenal glands down here they and the pituitary hormones controlled by the hypothalamus so you have this entire pathway here starting from the hypothalamus pituitary and adrenal is called HPA axis so the brain is telling the pituitary to send signals down to release the adrenal hormones and then we have feed a feedback loop going around here turning this mechanism off so when you take prednisone you basically shut this whole thing off from this level and so the adrenal glands just stop working and so it prednisone for any period of time now I personally had poison ivy every single year through my 20s and even partially into my 30s every single year I was in the back yard or something and I got poisoned I having to take prednisone okay for many years so it really created some serious damage on my own adrenals so I couldn sleep had chronic fatigue syndrome I was constantly getting sick I had massive blood sugar problems but the cool thing is that there safe alternative and it is called vitamin d3 I mean if you think about it vitamin D gets great results with asthma allergies all sorts of skin problems sima psoriasis and it anti-inflammatory and it beneficial for autoimmune conditions especially MS and hives but if you think about vitamin D can actually give you that almost the same results as prednisone it version of prednisone why because vitamin D is not really a vitamin it steroid hormone okay it powerful anti-inflammatory it gives you therapeutic benefit at higher dosages unfortunately the RDA is just way too low and the RDAs for vitamin D are roughly I think around 600 IU I create some really cool effects I gonna put some links down below so you can get more information and research this but you would want to take 20 to 30,000 IU micrograms of k 2 and this will counter the calcium issue that can occur from higher amounts of d3 because d3 doesn really tell the calcium where to go it just increases the absorption of calcium into the blood by 20 X K to will take that calcium and drive it into the bone so if you you take anymore because it create too many side effects you may want to check this out right here in vitamin d3 thanks for watching so if you want to get notified with all my content click the notification bell next to subscribed	Success
Why the Dark Circles Under Your Child's Eyes	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu8mC792R10	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so in this video I want to talk about why a child may have the dark circles underneath the eyes that has to do with a iron deficiency now that doesn necessarily mean that they can have an iron deficiency and they not anemic but they could also be an anemic an iron deficiency can also create other symptoms like fatigue lethargy dizziness they look pale irritable craving ice or even dirt and delayed growth because iron is involved in so many different chemical pathways and enzymes you can have a lot of different symptoms now the question is why would they be deficient okay so either they that has iron or the consuming foods that block iron it also could be a digestive problem that won simulate iron like let IBS or Crohn a child has been on anti acids chances are they don and that alone is a big clue that they need to acidify the stomach also if they that can also block the absorption of iron but a real common reason why children are deficient iron has to do with the grains that they consume even if it the grain including the grains have something called phytates okay phytates are a chemical compound in grains and other foods that bind the iron making it really hard to absorb that trace mineral and there are two types of iron you have heme iron which is absorbable iron from animal products and you have non heme iron from plants and legumes and other things and so if the child is not consuming enough animal products I chicken or turkey over pork and that could be the reason why they deficient in iron because these animal products have the type of iron that is very easy to absorb in the body so what you need to do is get them not to consume grains okay get them to consume some red meat liver if they don liver they can do liver pills make sure it food clams octopus mussels oyster all have a good amount of iron you can even get Easter but what you don don supplement from a drugstore because that always want to do food base iron or a food based complex okay or actually just the food and yes it in spinach and vegetables but it difficult to absorb so if they have this symptom you want to do these right here you do want them to consume vegetables and salads because that will give them the vitamin C and other nutrients too because when someone has an iron deficiency they usually have other deficiencies and the other thing about vitamin C is that vitamin C will help the absorption of iron alright thanks for watching I just wanted to say thank you so much for watching my videos I really appreciate it and if you wouldn review I put a link down below	Success

Can a Frail Senior Parent Do Intermittent Fasting? Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXIY3N56K10	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I I creating videos based on the questions so I had a question someone wanted to know can a frail senior parent do in a minute fasting okay so let that there course if they concern is you don weight but what about all the amazing benefits neurogenesis you actually regrow your brain cells increasing stem cell extend your life it you do a version of in a minute fasting that doesn so if you actually calculate how many calories your parent has okay and you just push them to two meals less frequent without reducing the calories maybe even making sure that the fat is high enough to prevent any actual weight loss because then what will happen is the body is going to start burning up the dietary fat more than their own fat and that would prevent this okay but then we can get the benefits of this so I would work towards having them eat the first meal at 11 o morning and the next meal at 6:00 and absolutely no snacks in between or at night that period to see some really good benefits and then go from there the key is keeping your calories high or the same as you were in the three meals and snacks not dipping down which usually means you got to keep the fat higher I would also recommend fermented vegetables okay very very important for someone that is elderly just to start reestablishing the flora and getting the pH correct vitamin k2 is vital as well because as someone ages they tend to calcify so they got calcification in the arteries the joints and so we want to remove that calcification vitamin k2 is what you need to do so if you give them vitamin k2 with the d3 together okay I recommend a ratio of a hundred micrograms of k2 mk7 version a to every 10,000 IU vitamin D and that and you can minimize the calcification but here improves the output of the mitochondria it proves the cardiovascular output it more endurance they and the last thing I would recommend is make sure that stomach is acidic as you age you lose the acid in your stomach making it harder and harder to digest the protein that they need a fat which is which actually the acid and the stomach triggers the gallbladder by the way so if you don your stomach potentially you going to release enough file so that stomach acid is really really important especially if we calories higher so what you have to do is you have to give them the tain hydrochloride and or outside of vinegar pills right before the meal that would be very beneficial alright guys so that thanks for watching hey guys real quick I have a new healthy keto eating plan for you just go to dr.

ÂHard of HearingÂ and Iodine Deficiency	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q0ymrPE9-4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so whether your child is hard-of-hearing or maybe a parent or even your spouse let that and a real simple remedy okay now there are two structures in your brain that control hearing one is the auditory cortex and the second is the inferior colliculus and realize this even though that one third of your brain runs on glucose you don glucose your body can make it it called gluconeogenesis it can make it from protein it can make it from fat it can mobilise your storage sugar and the mineral iodine is crucial in the regulation of energy in your body and think about it what gland controls your energy production let and what gland needs iodine to regulate that energy the thyroid the thyroid makes t4 okay and then it converts to t3 which is the active form of the thyroid hormone t4 is inactive in four and the three represents the number of iodine molecules that are that that hormone so your hearing mechanism is dependent on the thyroid and iodine if a pregnant mother is deficient iodine within the first two trimesters of pregnancy the risk factor for hypothyroidism goes way up also other risk factors go up the loss of hearing decrease IQ poor growth and development many many different things and on top of that a lot of people are deficient in iodine especially children in fact 241 million children worldwide are deficient in iodine so unless you like seafood or fish it become iodine deficient simply because the soils don that they need so very very simple and inexpensive way to get your iodine seek help so sea kelp that is harvested in a really clean ocean would be a really good source not just of iodine but all of the trace minerals it good at amino acids as well and especially if a woman is pregnant okay she should be consuming seek help now some people say they to iodine because when they consume shellfish or fish or something they break out in a rash it to iodine directly it food that you to iodine in that case then I would recommend going to the health store and finding a supplement that has iodine without anything extra and they should be totally fine now I put some studies down below that show some interesting fascinating data between your hearing and iodine and sometimes it takes several months before you can see improvement but if you know someone that has hearing problems put them on seek help and see if it can help them so if you want to get notified with all my content click the notification bell next to subscribed	Success
How To Know if You Have Bile Deficiency? - Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvagzivxGO0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so how does one really know if they deficient in bile what is bile bile is a detergent okay it helps you break down the fats that helps you break them down and it helps you extract the fat side of vitamins and other essential fats like omega-3 fatty acids without bile you can into the body but bile does a lot more than that it helps keep your microbial balance in check it helps keep the fat from building up in the liver it helps remove toxic waste through the body it helps eliminate the excess of cholesterol that your body doesn lubricate the colon to allow food to go through the body a lot easier so number one if you usually be low in one of the fat soluble vitamins so vitamin A there symptoms but one would be you can in the dark too well you can vitamin D deficiency bone pain lowered mood because one of the symptoms of vitamin D is depression between lower immune system it could be many different things psoriasis is will be one and if you side of a vitamin you might have dry skin you may have hot flashes chest pain but the big one is weak muscles because without vitamin E you just don the level of oxygen for the muscles to work effectively and then vitamin k1 you have a lot of issues you could have kidney stones you can have calcified arteries you could have high blood pressure from that you can even have calcium deposits in your joints alright number two jaundice okay you start looking a little yellow and the whites of the eye and even the skin 3 is constipation why because bio lubricates the colon now if you have too much bile you get diarrhea by the way and as a side note if you have diarrhea you don take bowel cells because that worse alright number four you could develop a fatty liver if your bile deficient also bloating because bile helps you digest fad so if you stuff is gonna sit there longer and you burp and belch that sluggish gallbladder all right number six your stool floats why because you not digesting fat and the fat ends up in your stool and it will flow or your stool is light-colored you may develop gall stones as a symptom of a bile deficiency because bile is there to help prevent gall stones now why would you be deficient in the first place well maybe you you are the stimulus to release bile or let bile is made from your liver it in the gall butter but it the liver so if there liver either fatty liver it or you have cirrhosis that could be why you say you don removed well you deficient in which case you need to take some bile salts after the meal all right no gut bacteria or a lesser amounts of gut bacteria your bacteria is there to help you recycle bile over 90 percent of the bile in your body is recycled and when you eat your body is very efficient in recycling this bile over and over and over to extract more and more of these nutrients from the food that you eating so we really need this gut bacteria for that or let a damaged GI system where you have scar tissue in the colon and guess what that absorption of bile salts so you don have that for recycling anymore because only a little bit of it through so whether you have Crohn irritable bowel syndrome or some past damage with your GI tract that could limit your bile in which case you might need to substitute and take some vile to achieve the right amounts all right guys see in the next video so if you ahead and share it with someone that could really benefit from it	Success

The 3 Causes Of Eye Twitching (Tetany) Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zfdf3voy2I	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I want to talk about the three main causes of twitching or tetany where you have this little it could be in the arm where it face it starts twitching and you wondering what the heck is that well there alkalosis okay this is a condition where your body is too alkaline and I talking about the blood that difficult to test the pH of your blood because as soon as you pull it out it oxidizes and it changes the pH so it very very difficult so I put a video down below of all the symptoms and alkalosis so you can kind of see if maybe you have that condition okay now there is decrease potassium okay in the diet number two is not enough hydrochloric acid in your stomach so if you don have this certifiers you tend to go more on the alkaline side and that would be having your pH go a little higher than it should also cortisol which is triggered by stress that can also alkalize the body being on a diuretic you can lose potassium and you have alkalosis as well now when the pH in your blood is a little too alkaline what happens since about 40% of your calcium is transported through a protein called albumin the calcium binds very very tightly to that protein and it becomes unavailable to you so we usually have low calcium okay and calcium is one of the electrolytes so if you don going to have a problem with transmission of nerve and muscle impulses and you phenomenon of twitching okay so the connection between alkalosis and twitching is really the calcium okay now what it makes more sense to take more calcium now because calcium especially in the form of calcium carbonate like limestone is very alkalizing so that would make it worse because you already alkaline what you have to do is drop the pH and we will talk about that in the next slide also if you acids okay that and that could be causing the alkalosis as well directly all right next thing is hypocalcemia that talked about that right here but there an actual entire condition hypocalcemia that could be coming from low parathyroid hormone or low vitamin D which is probably the more common cause some of the symptoms of hypocalcemia are tingling in the tips of the fingers okay around the mouth it can be another place as well on your toes and bottom of the feet arrhythmias of the heart palpitations psychosis depression anxiety low blood pressure and the last one is hypomagnesemia okay this is low magnesium in the blood that create tremors spasms fatigue arrhythmias pappa tations very similar to this right because this is low calcium this is low magnesium this is low potassium this could be created from taking anti acids or let example you had insulin resistance which most people do like a pre-diabetic state because you need the insulin transporters to transport magnesium antibiotics diuretics low vitamin D fluoride actually will lower your magnesium okay let action steps here we go number one acidify apple cider vinegar start consuming that one the two tablespoons in a glass of water with the straw a few times a day you can take betaine hydrochloride if your hydrochloric acid is as low and you take it right before you eat it digestion you can also get these in pill form okay so we want to acidify that going to allow the calcium to unbind from the protein and the calcium will start to help in the normal contraction or relaxation process number two add magnesium and potassium just so happens both of those minerals are in these things called vegetables okay all right number three add some vitamin D that will increase the calcium if you stress of course get a water filter you know instead of drinking tap water so you can pull out the fluorine and also get a shower filter so you can filter out the fluorides as well all right guys there you have it go ahead and get started so if you want to get notified with all my content click the notification bell next to subscribed	Success
Why do You Have Salt Cravings at Night? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJiwXpLOaFI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	if you had cravings for salty foods at night especially this video is for you and I popcorn peanuts pretzels chips I believe the reason why you crave that is because you actually are deficient in sodium okay now why would you crave those foods those junk foods and not just regular salt well it pregnant and she craves ice cream for example she calcium and there have some pretty strange cravings too like for example dirt they might need iron so apparently when you in something your body will cause the craving to something that maybe resembles that that mineral or nutrient and this topic of salt is very fascinating now realize that salt is sodium chloride sodium is one of the minerals so I between sodium and salt as we go through this presentation but the World Health Organization is advising that people start lowering their salt intake to about 2000 milligrams or less per day and it would take about 1 teaspoon of salt to achieve 2300 milligrams of sodium so realize that the soul has the chloride and there for that but we right now and also salt now it is true that Americans consume more than this amount by a factor of a thousand so they milligrams of salt per day but that salt that they coming from the salt shaker it is coming from the other foods with the hidden salt in it the refined carbohydrates the bread the cold cut deli meats so of course someone along the line had this idea that wow people are consuming too much salt so it must be the salt that the culprit is there a possibility that could be the other ingredients that come with the salt I mean before refrigeration we salted our foods successfully we consumed a lot more salt in meats and other foods and our risk of heart attacks back then even blood pressure was a lot less than it is right now but of course if you look at this logically if you add more salt you have more fluid have more blood pressure have more heart attacks right that makes sense logically but there that I highly recommend you read if you low salt diet because what these studies show in their very credible studies that your risk for heart problems stroke insulin resistance go up when you go on a low salt diet and there study that I description that when you increase the sodium in the diet the risk factors for heart attack and stroke plummet why is that well if you read the study you gonna also find those people that were increasing the sodium also we increasing their potassium okay and it the potassium that protects the heart I mean it everyone that has high blood pressure or heart problems on a low salt diet but there the potassium levels or even more importantly is removing the refined carbs that are attached to the salt their focus is to lower the salt as insult free refined carbohydrate type foods which leads to more consumption of the refined carbohydrates that are now salt free now this next part is very very interesting if you check back in right now because this part is very very important your body has a hormone called aldosterone that has one vital purpose to retain and hold sodium your body wouldn hormone unless there was a very important purpose of having sodium without sodium your nerves cannot conduct nerve impulses without sodium your muscles can would not be in balance okay you wouldn and other nutrients as well without sodium there sodium potassium pump in nearly all of your cells of your body that help transport things through the cell membrane very very important so this is why the body has this hormone aldosterone and take it well guess what triggers aldosterone a low sodium or low salt diet okay so your body will make three times as much aldosterone when you think about blood pressure medication there blocking aldosterone okay or a diuretic which will cause an excess release of sodium and water through the urine and as a side note older people lose this function in other words they don the amount of aldosterone to hold the sodium so usually they deficient in sodium I mean the side effects from not having enough sodium are way worse than having too much sodium so if you combine someone on a salt-free diet okay on diuretics then we have the excessive amount of water and I drinking massive amounts of water not eight or ten glasses I like a gallon in a day and they working out and they diet that can be very very dangerous to the heart you need sodium for the heart to work for your muscles to work when you salt as well because when you typical diet which is high carbohydrate you holding more salt okay when you keto you get rid of the excess fluid and you also get rid of some of these minerals so you need to put them back in exercise produces sweat and you lose sodium through exercise and of course being out in the heat will do it as well a pro football player could potentially lose up to six thousand milligrams of sodium in ninety minutes if you have liver damage as in cirrhosis you could actually be deficient in sodium with adrenal fatigue you have low sodium this is why like for example in conditions like Addison disease where they don adrenal hormones you always see a severe deficiency of sodium and these people have to consume a ton of salt and you also going to see a sodium deficiency in hypothyroidism I would recommend consuming at a minimum between 1 and 1.5 teaspoons of sea salt per day if you increase your salt you should get rid of the cravings for salty junk foods at night and it would be very very beneficial for you to take one average day of eating and analyze how much salt you sodium you and just compare it to this to see if you and also to see if you actually crave salty foods at night and then you can make adjustments on that as well because there is a lot of salt in the food that you we just want to know how much you need to add to that to meet your requirements you energy is gonna go up you have more endurance because the cardiovascular system will function better the other important thing to realize is that the sodium works with potassium okay in the body so we always have this ratio if you to increase more potassium we need 4700 milligrams very few people consume in this amount if you absolutely positively do not need to worry how much salt that you consuming because it you enough to act as a buffer and one way to achieve that is to increase your vegetable amounts okay 7 to 10 cups of vegetables per day it you have two salads I do all my sell in one sitting I have one large bowl and it people can there are vegetable substitutes you can do to enhance your vegetables I some links down below but you do need to start increasing this in the diet because this will also give you the magnesium and a lot of people put sea salt on their salad which I highly recommend or they might put salty olives or Parmesan cheese which is salty or other cheeses that would be a very very good idea and lastly if you salt diet because your doctor told you you need to be on one send your doctor the studies that I put down below to have them just take a look at it because this is quite fascinating where you have these diets that talk about the risk factors for high blood pressure and heart problems go down when you increase more salt it increasing this the potassium as well alright guys there you have it these are

5 Uncommon Signs & Symptoms of Potassium Deficiency Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZRfTLoGNnw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today I want to talk about five uncommon signs of a potassium deficiency a lot of people understand the potassium Xin volved with the heart the rhythm of the heart maybe blood sugars nerve and muscle physiology but what they might not realize it other things as well energy metabolism protein synthesis and actually making muscle glucose metabolism the conversion of glucose to glycogen which is the storage form of glucose so one of the biggest symptoms of a potassium deficiency is fatigue okay you just you just lose your energy alright number two low endurance or low stamina you just run it a gas fast especially when you climbing stairs so you basically just run out of energy a lot quicker than you should number three increase urination at night so many times we prediabetes but it could be a potassium deficiency but that potassium deficiency could be coming because you because insulin resistance is involved and when you have in some resistance you can magnesium that well and just as a side note it extra potassium and magnesium if you have diabetes or you have insulin resistance that will actually help the urination at night next one is constipation because of the necessity of potassium involved in the smooth muscle that forms the colon and number five paralysis after a high carb meal when you consume a lot of carbohydrates your need for potassium goes way up because potassium is involved in not just energy metabolism but glucose metabolism as well and you have this shift of this electrolyte out of the muscle cell getting a temporary paralysis and this relates even myself because when I was getting married 29 years ago Karen and I went to shop for wedding cakes so I don cakes this is before I knew anything about nutrition and then we ended up at an Italian restaurant and we had all carbs pizza I was doing wine that was really sweet and then right at the end I noticed that they were actually taking these carts of all these desert samples they would come around to the table and they mentioned would you like to sample any of these before we toss these and of course my mind I don food right so we started sampling all this sugar all these desserts for probably another half hour it was really bad so that was a high carb meal as we pounding like crazy I get into the house and I feel like faint I feel tired my muscles are weak like my legs are I feel like like cement I didn heart was racing I was totally awake so that might have not have been a paralysis but it was definitely a side effect from doing too many carbs okay guys so and also realized that you need 4700 milligrams of potassium and some people need a little bit more especially after doing the hardcore workouts and you would get this mainly from these things called vegetables even though those are carbohydrates or lower with potassium they and so that build up your potassium Reserve thanks for watching so if you want to get notified with all my content click the notification bell next to subscribed	Success
What is the REAL Cause of Cold Feet Â 6 Possible Causes Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIgxshnJtHM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I wanted to talk about the six reasons or causes of cold feet this is an updated video I did one before on the five causes there information I there one would be you and you have cold feet that was a joke but let adrenal hormones okay there condition called Addison you basically running out of adrenal hormones and you have extremely low sodium you have to constantly consume salt because a big part of the adrenal function is to regulate minerals including salt and that would be right here number four you can actually have cold feet if you have low sodium okay and this can occur if you ketogenic diet simply because when you go keto low-carb you lose a lot of fluid excess fluid and with the fluid you lose salt and other electrolytes also you giving up a lot of junk foods processed foods that have a lot of sodium hidden even bread for example and so when you the salt the sea salt in your diet and people that go on keto sometimes they notice especially in the beginning that their feet are cold unless they consume more sea salt number one is low adrenal hormones or adrenal fatigue and also this could cause low blood pressure which could be another reason why you number two hypothyroidism this is the kind of the classic reason why people are cold you need more iodine and selenium selenium is needed for the conversion of hormones like the inactive to the active form of thyroid hormone and iodine is needed just to make the thyroid hormone in the first place so these two minerals are very important if you deficient in these minerals potentially you can actually develop hypothyroidism now a version of hypothyroidism called Hashimoto responds pretty well to selenium selenium also is very beneficial to the immune system I video just on selenium okay number three diet bad egg especially when you get neuropathies like you get nerve damage in the lower extremity or even in the hands you start losing circulation and in your feet and your fingers don can actually get become numb and they can have tingling and it peripheral neuropathy and before I talked about that you need more salt because a low sodium diet can cause you to be cold especially in the feet and number five is low zinc okay and number six is low iron as an anemia that can also cause you to be cold now the question is which one relates to you you want to look at some of the other symptoms that you have to see which one aligns I put a bunch of videos down below for example the symptoms of low zinc or the symptoms of low iron symptoms of low sodium so you can kind of differentiate and figure this out alright guys thanks for watching so if you want to get notified with all my content click the notification bell next to subscribed	Success
The Real Causes of Acid Reflux, Heartburn & GERD Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhUTAw6wcK8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we causes of acid reflux heartburn and GERD if you have these conditions this will be very interesting okay now if you look up the actual cause of GERD it and by the way GERD is gastroesophageal reflux disorder it will tell you that it the sphincter and the stomach and it say that it of the sphincter which is that valve on top of the stomach that keeps everything intact and then if we look at the cause of heartburn it says that the cause is a symptom of GERD caused by acid reflux why if you look at the cause of acid reflux it it obesity hiatal hernia so there actually a lot of data or information about the actual causes of these it all about the risk factors it related triggers it is the medications that you need to be on etc and so what people end up doing is they end up managing these symptoms with several different types of anti-acids you have the protein pump inhibitors you have the tums which is the calcium carbonate and something called h2 receptor blocker okay all three of these basically reduce the acid in the stomach okay let a look at the side effects c-diff which is a bacterial infection osteoporosis decreased b12 decrease magnesium allergy reactions heart attacks and this thing called a chloride RIA okay tums gas nausea kidney stones allergies constipation and this thing called a core hydrea then we have decreased sex drive insomnia muscle pain vomiting constipation and a chloride RIA Wow look at that what is this let it the acid in your stomach anymore okay you have another condition called hypo chloride Riya okay which is decreased or diminished acid in the stomach and this is basically no acid in your stomach let effects okay the Sun affects GERD acid reflux heartburn interesting decrease b12 constipation decrease magnesium and decrease zinc because the medications are actually causing this condition which is creating the same problem alright so what picture we have GERD acid reflux heartburn then then you take any acids which then deplete the acid which then cause the same symptoms over and over and we have this interesting cycle right here so then the question is what causes these conditions okay is it too much acid well that different that that is more of a acid stomach which can then lead to gastritis maybe it the fluid is this too acidic right but but what is the normal pH of the stomach between 1 and 3 okay I mean this the pH scale goes from 1 to 14 you can more acidic fluid than 1 so the problem is not that it acid the problem is with all three of these you splashing up into the esophagus because of this valve problem and the valve is controlled by the autonomic nervous system so really we have an autonomic nervous system problem that treated with an anti acid which then cause these three symptoms very interesting so let at the cause of a chloride riah okay one of the causes is H pylori this microbe actually depletes the stomach acids making the stomach acid less acid okay another cause would be deficient Zink which by the way is one of the best remedies for ulcers and gastritis decrease potassium decrease sodium decrease whole rides okay unique chloride to make hydrochloric acid decrease iodine decreased vitamin b3 so you need nutrients to build hydrochloric acid also a heel hypothyroid condition you can have this condition and any acids can cause this condition here if this condition causes these three conditions then what would happen if we added the acid back into the stomach and guess what I and time again when you add more acid into a stomach with these conditions these conditions go away things like apple cider vinegar and betaine hydrochloride are very very effective apparently there between the stomach acid and the valve and if the stomach acid is the correct pH that valve will stay nice and tight but if you have these conditions make sure you also understand that you need to fortify your your your body with these nutrients right here zinc potassium salt okay sea salt iodine which by the way is in the sea salt and b3 all right guys go ahead and try this and comment below on your results if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
What do Your Nails Say About Your Health & Nutrition? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RopzcyBbXDk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we to determine nutrient deficiencies based on looking at your nails now I webinar on this topic before which is more of a complete video talking about the hair the skin inside the mouth so you can check that out I put a link down below but in this video we focus just on your nail now your nail gives a lot of clues on what internally relating to your nutrients and your foods so let through step by step let vertical ridges okay that could be a slow thyroid hypothyroidism but it can also be a deficiency in vitamin b12 okay or iron but if you deficient in iron you probably one or two ridges which are gonna be a little bit bigger if your nails are brittle and they break easily usually a deficiency in folate okay this comes from leafy greens people that have brittle nails usually do not consume enough vegetables also deficiency in biotin which is related to your flora or your good bacteria because your microbes actually can make biotin now if you have a history of taking antibiotics or you have some digestive issue you may be deficient in biotin just from that and also fungus on the nail which is kind of a yellowish discoloration on your nail that because there your gut okay and that biotin is not not working that well also taking silica will strengthen your nails as well if you have this little white spot which this is green but it would be white that white spot is right in the center and the nail grows every six months we know you probably had a birthday party six months ago and you ate the entire cake because we sugar deplete zinc also stress will deplete zinc as well and so well IBS digestive issues a lot of issues with your digestion will create a zinc deficiency including low stomach acid okay if you get the horizontal white lines through here okay that here we have horizontal lines which are thicker but they usually a deficiency of vitamin b3 niacin if the nail is slightly brown or grey that could be low b12 and a b12 deficiency can occur if you you comes from animal products or it could be that you had gastric bypass which affects the digestion and the absorption - b12 or it could be low stomach acids if the nail is clubbed let example it can be a problem with the liver or kidney if you have this pattern where most of it is excessively white you just the top part is pink a pink strip and that could be b12 if the nail is completely white or blue that can be a b1 deficiency so as you can see the common theme is low B vitamins and low minerals because both of those nutrients are involved as coenzymes in proteins and your nail is mostly protein so it not just a matter of consuming protein it the foods to turn on certain enzymes to make the protein grow correctly if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
How To Slow Down The Aging Process: 3 Life Hacks For Anti Aging Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8bFLDWUs3k	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so in this video I want to show you some simple things you can do to slow down the aging process now some of the information I video is out of this book right here I gonna break it down really simply but it oxidants in biology fascinating read you need a medical dictionary to get through it because there but there book okay and they balance between antioxidants and oxidants okay in the environment so you have this constant battle because if you oxidation you can kind of compare this to a car rusting out I mean it weird that oxygen would create damage but too much of it can be very very damaging to your cells okay the mitochondria which is at the heart of your metabolism it and it actually has an engine and uses oxygen to break down fuel so it actually releases oxidants okay now some of that is good for the body in that these oxidants that your body makes kills off microbes but when the mitochondria and other parts of the cell become damaged and you from that that can actually destroy the cell and create all sorts of problems and set you up for even getting cancer so there and there thing goes with antioxidants which counter the oxidation you can get antioxidants from food and your body can make antioxidants and that is called endogenous antioxidants this means antioxidants that are made within your body as compared to exogenous antioxidants which are antioxidants outside the body okay so from vegetables for example but a really really important and misunderstood area is building up your antioxidant Network and getting your body to make more antioxidants so I just a few things you can do to build up this network without taking external antioxidants the hormone called melatonin is a very powerful antioxidant okay this occurs when you when it gets dark and the less light coming into the eye there an entire cascade of things that happen in your brain and one is you get a spike of melatonin melatonin actually gets rid of hydrogen peroxide maybe you have used hydrogen peroxide in the past let you had a cut and you want to sterilize it to kill the bacteria you you put the hydrogen peroxide and it bubbles up and it kills off the microbes well your cells actually make hydrogen peroxide to kill off microbes as well but sometimes our bodies make too much hydrogen peroxide and that body because it oxidation well if you have enough melatonin this can counter that and that don buying melatonin what I am gonna recommend is just getting more sleep or take naps okay so the second thing that they talk about in here is the difference between occasional exercise and regular exercise regular exercise as in routine in on a regular basis will build up your endogenous antioxidant Network okay now initially when you do exercise let say it generate tremendous amounts of oxidation it let it over time your body gets used to it it starts to adapt and it starts to build up huge amounts of antioxidants to counter the stress or oxidation damage from exercise so regular exercise on a consistent basis will help to build up your antioxidants and protect you against oxidation and you are going to start looking younger when you do this and it could be as simple as walking every day but routine regular exercise is very very important so we have high quality regular sleep or naps and regular exercise it seems really really simple next one is fasting and I talking about regular fasting as in intermittent fasting because you can just do fasting on a long-term basis because at some point you have to eat right but intamin fasting would be a regular routine of combination of fasting and eating and that produces huge spike in your endogenous antioxidant Network an ideal pattern for you to work up to would be 20 hours of fasting in a 4-hour eating window so let you a tab 3 and then the next meal would be at 4 5 6 and 7 ok so it would be 4 hours later that would be like the eating window but then you hours that would be very very beneficial if you below of how to do that the benefit of fasting is something called a Tov G a tov adji means self eating so your body is actually recycling its own tissue one of the bad effects from oxidation that causes aging or premature aging is what oxidation does to your proteins okay it creates what proteins and these proteins kind of gunk up and they get stuck in the body they don clog up things between your neurons creating memory problems and eventually Alzheimer they they miss folder proteins come from oxidation and also they actually create oxidation they create a toxic effect in the body and your body has a hard time getting rid of these because they non-functional well it just so happens that fasting through a tough OG can take these miss folder proteins put them into a garbage disposal and start to break down these proteins okay there body uses in certain enzymes to break down this protein and on the other side it spits out brand-new amino acids that your body can then use to rebuild so fasting really slows down the aging process as well as stimulate certain genes that help so here we have sleeping or napping regular exercise and intimate of fasting these three are very very very powerful and that attention on this okay the next thing to do is to avoid excessive amount of oxidants now a body makes enough oxidants for us to then get more externally iron for example like let multi supplement from the drugstore read the label make sure it doesn in it because that wrong type of iron the thing about iron is it difficult to get rid of iron if there too much so you want to avoid cooking and iron skillets for example and definitely don supplement unless you have for example some anemia which you you tested it in which case you can take a food base iron which comes from like bovine liver make sure it and of course one of the biggest things that creates oxidation is high levels of sugar in the diet even your blood Sugar oxidate the the eyes kidney the nerves the brain so this is a real big one right here glycation what is that that is the combination between sugar and a protein so if you are cooked with sugar and protein that really really bad or you foods with fat and sugar together heated that would be very very bad that creates some serious oxidation so that would be like ice cream for example because you sugar you glycation and glycation also happens in our bodies if you have high levels of blood sugar and your body is 98.6 it can actually create glycation of your your red blood cells and one of the tests for that which is related to diabetes is called a1c that protein in your blood so you want to reduce the glycation simply by knocking out this sugar okay and then vegetable oils especially the corn and the soy oil very high in omega-6 creates a lot of oxidation frequent meals will increase oxidation thus the intermittent fasting so let say for example you join the gym right and they have this CrossFit class and they year fifty-five years old very bad you exercise without much recovery it gonna create a lot of oxidation and then we have cortisol having too much your cortisol over a period of time without enough recovery is really bad this has to do a stress also if you prednisone or a cortisol or any medication that can create some massive damage and the damage is creating is oxidation so stress in general creates a lot of oxidation on your body but if you sleep you can easily counter the stress of life but you need to look at the big picture and really look at the balance of these two okay we want to build up your endogenous antioxidant Network and of course we have trans fats you want to avoid those and then there other things avoiding chemicals pesticides GMO foods all of that creates oxidation and the last thing I to just touch on is exogenous antioxidants raw vegetables cruciferous usually you want to steam some of your cruciferous but then have your salads raw and that nutrients in cruciferous which give additional health benefits that go beyond just vitamins and minerals alright guys so that was your tip of the day the next step is for you to go ahead and implement this if you subscribe now and I will actually keep

7 Reasons Why You Experience Metallic Taste in Mouth Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWO-ll6p_yg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so let a metallic taste in your mouth what could it be number one let on chemotherapy that will do it because of all the chemicals in your body number two medications especially antibiotics there chemicals and medication and that usually the elephant in the room if you you have this metallic taste chances are it pregnancy and I minute alright number four synthetic vitamins okay when you buy a vitamin from a druggist or not a health food store but a drugstore chances are they be synthetic like 90% of all vitamins out there are made synthetically so you have the synthetic version of a vitamin and then you have the minerals which are not coming from actual food they called elemental and when you take those you could actually have a metallic taste in your mouth I don synthetic vitamins unless you some short-term cleanse or detox for various purposes number five you have too many heavy metals from certain maybe fish at your consuming shark swordfish Marlin and tuna are all high in heavy metals like mercury cadmium things like that now I know some of you are going wait a second I consumed tuna make sure you do the light tuna skipjack okay not the albacore in the can okay be better off doing the salmon in the can but tuna has three times the mercury as some of the other fish now there is mercury and other fish even like salmon but these other fish are high in selenium and selenium is part of an enzyme to help detoxify mercury and other heavy metals so selenium is a very vital mineral in keeping these heavy metals at bay certain cookware that you example you I would recommend reevaluate what you cook in and make sure it doesn something that is harmful tap water is loaded with a lot of chemicals not just chlorine and fluoride but heavy metals as well as other chemicals and even medications okay so get a good filter to actually get rid of that stuff pesticides because you organic food you food that has pesticides insecticides and those are going to be loaded with chemicals that actually can get in your body and you can actually taste them however the biggest reason for a metallic taste in your mouth is a zinc deficiency now if you deficient in zinc you your taste okay and smell but if you have a marginal or subclinical deficiency of zinc you can really alter your taste to the point where you tasting a metallic taste and also chemotherapy depletes your zinc certain medications chelate or block the zinc and pregnancy as well so a lot of times if a woman is pregnant and she eating the right foods she deficient in certain things because the demand from the fetus is pulling all these nutrients out so it become deficient if she the right foods or she many carbohydrates or refined sugars she needs to consume seafood very very important now if you want more information on how to get more zinc in your body as far as the foods I put a link down below thanks for watching if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
7 Reasons Why You Get Up During the Night Â Dr.Berg On Sleep Apnea	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1COqq37F82Q	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we seven reasons why you are up through the night and you can entire night if you have a problem sleeping this is a very important video I parts of this but I video that explains all the reasons so this is based on working with 40,000 people over 29 years okay so this is the stuff that will help you number one high blood sugar if you pre-diabetic and you have high blood sugars what happens is that water follows this sugar so you up peeing more especially at night so just by fixing the blood sugar issue you longer so if you put a link down below of how to do that number two which relates to one high insulin which is a little different insulin stimulates something called the sympathetic nervous system the system that part of the nervous system that controls the stress signals okay when you have too much of this system you will not be able to hold your bladder so you going to want to get up and go to the bathroom over and over and over again so you want to decrease insulin the same solution that fixes this will fix this I put a link down below number three high cortisol this is the adrenal hormone this is a stress hormone and what happens is when you go to bed at night normally you go through four waves of sleep these are called circadian waves from a superficial wave which is the REM sleep to the deep delta-wave sleep right here with higher levels of cortisol not only are you not able to get into the deeper sleep cycles but usually you waking up about 2:00 a.m. in the morning which is exactly when you should have the deepest sleep and I used to have this problem as well because I had high cortisol but you wake up at 2:00 and you are completely awake in fact you awake in the middle of the night than you are during the day yet sometimes they night when you should be sleeping that when you you wake up in the morning you most tired right here this situation usually occurs when you have years of stress I put a link down below of exactly what to do about it it show you how to fix this problem right here but another thing you can do as a temporary solution is to take higher amounts of vitamin d3 it can really help restore your cortisol levels and before too much coffee and tea because of the caffeine it certain amount for your liver to get rid of that caffeine personally I consume one small cup of coffee in the morning that says I don else simply because I used to drink a ton of coffee it be aware of because if you everything else right and you doing a little too much of this or too much of this that could be the reason why you night number five too much artificial light so let for example you have a computer job or you and you have this LED screen and you in your eyes this is definitely not good for the activation of certain hormones that help you sleep at night so you want to get a full spectrum light around your desk in your computer and you also want to go for a walk to offset the sitting and from the computer all day long and also get some vitamin D or in sunlight on your face and also one last point when you in the Sun and I see people wear the dark glasses and they don in their eyes and not to look into the Sun at 12 o allow the natural sunlight to penetrate the eyes so you can have somewhat of a recharging effect all right number six sleep apnea very common very simple solution all you have to do well this is a temporary solution because vitamin b1 helps a certain area in the brainstem that breathing centers and if you deficient you problem with this at night so it a matter of taking some b1 and also getting rid of the reason why you one is you carbohydrates okay so it comes back to these two right here you need to lower the carbohydrates in your diet and you also need to take nutritional yeast which has the natural b1 versus a synthetic vitamin also be one helps the excessive thinking all the time that people are have anxiety and they worried all the time and that nervous tension that sleeping as well and there condition called lactic acidosis as a byproduct of having too much carbohydrate and diet and that can build up and that can actually throw up your ph well it just so happens that vitamin b1 gets rid of this this lactic acid okay all right I want to talk about the last one number seven which is pH that can affect your sleep there one is that your body is too alkaline and the other is your body now if you you muscles are gonna be tense and tight and there faster than having a charley horse in the middle of the night okay vitamin D will also help this vitamin d3 but in reality you may want to take some outside of vinegar because these minerals the alkaline minerals especially like the magnesium potassium calcium and even sodium need a certain pH for those minerals to be activated if your pH is too alkaline these minerals just don you muscles techne a lot of spasms things like that so it adding the absolute vinegar vitamin d3 would help your calcium absorption because if you won be exhausted but your head won off okay vitamin D will help you with that vitamin D will also help you with the high cortisol but also it can act as an off switch if you night you just can can help getting you in that deeper delta-wave sleep now one time I remember drinking too much kombucha tea it comes in a bottle like this and it carbonated very acidic I drank the whole thing when normally you should drink like half of it or less than that and I remember just having these symptoms right here my pulse rate went up I was really restless the nervous system was on edge higher pulse rate and air hunger so I was sighing frequently like I just couldn to do for this one is alkalize the body and you can do it several ways you can do with calcium magnesium or potassium now you have all seven reasons why you fits your situation and comment

How To Get Rid Of Cravings During Menstrual Cycle With ONE Nutrient? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVGr_ywd_iI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so recently I had a question from someone that wanted to know how to get rid of the cravings during the menstrual cycle now they a minute fasting so they have no cravings whatsoever until that time of the month and they have terrible cravings what could that be now for those of you that are watching that are not on the key to a plan or intermittent fasting click the link below watch that because chances are that should handle the cravings for good but if you still have cravings despite being on keto and in a minute fasting it usually has to do with low serotonin okay serotonin is a neurotransmitter it in the brain the location of where it made in the brain is in the brainstem the specific location is called the ref I Nikolai and this is involved in the sleep centers as well now it just so happens that in this little location where serotonin is made you also have a lot of estrogen receptors what a coincidence and the estrogen receptors in this location are controlling the amount of tryptophan coming in which is the precursor or the raw material to make serotonin now the most likely reason why you have low serotonin is that you have a low estrogen and there not enough estrogen to activate this tryptophan now some of the symptoms with low estrogen are mood swings as in PMS but PMS can also happen when you have high estrogen also headaches also depression decreased libido there more as well now given the assumption that you chances are you probably don low blood sugar situation or high insulin but if you are doing carbs then you need to fix this blood sugar situation so if you have this situation low serotonin okay there you can do you can take l-tryptophan you can get it from the health of store or online and make sure that you take L tryptophan which is the precursor to serotonin make sure you take it on an empty stomach because this molecule is very large and if you take other protein you won any change because this is not being absorbed so this should always be taken on an empty stomach alright number two you can raise Astra Jim now it typically causes low estrogen in the first place is something else is pushing it down okay it from stress as an adrenal fatigue or it can be high levels of testosterone or androgens okay and that comes from insulin so we want to lower insulin but if you doing it rid of fasting this should not be a problem so the last thing you can do to increase estrogen is to take flaxseed oil make sure it but this can elevate estrogen to a certain degree alright so I hope that answer the question and I will see you in the next video if you content please subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
What Causes Allergies? What are the Missing Nutrients in Allergies Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsq__sae5Yc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we missing nutrient analogies that being said there are other causes of allergies I haven that is behind quite a few different allergic reactions so the first thing I you a new word at 2 P this is a genetic tendency to develop allergies like rhinitis which is a sinus congestion sima rashes and just generally high histamines one cause of this is low folic acid okay so folic acid is involved in so many different biochemical reactions the one I to focus on is involving reducing histamines okay he would get folic acid from dark leafy greens you can also get it in beef liver but mainly it dark leafy green vegetables folic acid is involved with this enzyme MTHFR methylene tetra hydro folate reductase you didn the name of this enzyme this enzyme allows folic acid to work and many people have a mutation with this enzyme and you can actually get at the genetic test to see if you have this and I want to put some information below on this because I did another video on this but it people think but if you have a deviation or a mutation with this enzyme you going to be able to absorb and convert this into your body at well so you going to have a deficiency and one of the big symptoms is allergies and rashes through the body so here in addition to eating more dark leafy greens there be methylfolate four to seven milligrams per day b12 you want to get the methyl version not the cyano Cibola nine version this is more the natural activated version four thousand micrograms not milligrams and b6 400 milligrams and you want to take these together with a meal once a day for three months and there interesting research on this and this protocol so I put the link down below check it out and thanks for watching if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
How To Fix Your Chapped Lips? Â Dr.Berg On Remedy For Chapped Lips	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVG2K1zew4c	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today I want to talk about chapped lips okay one of the worst things you can do is actually taking a lip balm or chapstick because a lot of times the ingredients contain alcohol or some solvent or mineral oil that pulls oil out of your skin around your lips and then you need more of it and then you put it on it dries it out same thing with the hand creams as well and sometimes they put wax in there so you trying to create moisture but let about what a vitamin b2 deficiency when you in riboflavin okay your lips will dry out eventually you can get cracked corners of your mouth through here because b2 is an antimicrobial vitamin you can then become infected with Candida and it can turn red okay and then that can create fissures little cuts on the side of your mouth but button b2 is a coat enzyme b2 has one function of breaking down fats making sure that your skin is lubricated okay so what of this this coenzyme this activator for the protein that does that action and then you end up with dry lips so what are the foods that have b2 eggs leafy greens nuts dairy meats well happy to fish has b2 but really if they deficient it usually is coming from another factor they control pills which will definitely cause a b2 deficiency they might be a vegan in restricting certain foods that could create that but this is a big thing right here refined foods will deplete a lot of them B - in fact it mainly going to be the refined grains and the refined sugars now if you to my channel you need to click down below in the description of this diet called healthy keto okay and in a minute fasting if you already know about that but if you new to the channel you need to learn how to do that and that way you don to be deficient in these B vitamins anymore a lot of people that get on keto okay and they get off the grains they notice their skin is no longer dry they notice that the lips are no longer cracked anymore so if you were curious about what causes this it thanks for watching if you this content please subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
What Causes Sweaty / Dry Hands & How To Get Rid Of It? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4_8vRmQVmA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I wanted to create a quick video on the difference between sweaty palms and dry palms okay so if you have the sweaty palms that is a condition called Palmer hyperhidrosis and that is a sympathetic dominant situation there the autonomic nervous system you have the sympathetic and the parasympathetic the sympathetic is the flight-or-fight and part of that system is involved controlling different glands the sweat glands and that sweaty palms so what can you do about it well realizing that it adrenal anything that you do to help your adrenal is going to be a good thing there okay which involves one of the symptoms is getting up too fast and you feeling really dizzy that is also a sympathetic dominant situation a person who startles easily or they can tolerate stress would have sympathetic dominance one key vitamin that supports that part of the nervous system is about mb1 I put a link down below another treatment that seems to get pretty good results is called iontophoresis I recommending a certain machine you gonna have to do the research on that but you should look this up it seems to be very very successful now dry palms okay this has to do with a vitamin A deficiency vitamin D deficiencies will also cause dry eyes but also dry hands and you usually see these people putting tons of lotion on the hand and it lasts maybe like a minute and then it dries out again what you should look at is by them name okay and and and your diet and are you consuming foods that have high vitamin A and are you avoiding foods that are depleting by them an A a vitamin A is in fish oils especially column oil it it it which you know a lot of people do consume fat in their diet but usually it that process okay so let consuming a lot of refined foods or sugar that is messing with your liver or your gallbladder and then the gallbladder doesn consuming too much alcohol that can affect the gallbladder and liver that alone will prevent by the man apron being absorbed okay it could also be a problem with your digestion internally some inflammatory condition in your colon that will not let you absorb either than a and causing this dryness now the last point I want to bring up is that if you use lotion on a regular basis the fact that you lotion which usually has either alcohol in it or some other solvent in there you while before your skin can heal because it it pulls out the oil it dry up despite how much vitamin A you consuming so you putting lotion on your hand for a while you may want to put some vitamin E oil in your hand as a temporary thing to start healing the skin simply because all the oils are pulled out and vitamin E is a really good oil to put back into the skin and I think a lot of people have this idea that if I have dry skin I usually low fats either in the diet or you thanks for watching if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
What Causes Crusty Eyes/ Eye Boogers? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5wFZPF7xhI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	someone wanted to know about crusty eyes okay we behind that there for crusty eyes sleep dust ice and eye gunk sleeps and I neuters or I buggers so the cause of this condition is a low vitamin A situation by the man a deficiency when you your eyes do dry out but you at the same time get a thickened mucus around the eyes you can create itchiness so the fact that when you long you differentiate that from the feeling like you have sand in your eye but you don have sand or any crust that would be a vitamin b2 deficiency or a low blood sugar situation i po glycemia word is vitamin a come from vitamin a is a fat Seibel vitamin it comes from animal products mostly for talking about retinol which is the active form of vitamin A the pre vitamin a beta carotene and carotenoids which have the ability to turn into retinol those are from plants but the conversion is very very low but I do suggest consuming both animal and plant versions of vitamin A egg yolks have vitamin A beef liver cod liver oil it also vitamin D I highly recommend this right here now what will create a vitamin A deficiency would be having low iron that could do it or let don to digest fats it maybe is burnt out from consuming too many refined foods or consuming too many sugars or processed foods things like that gall bladder if there bladder problem if you don bladder if there you the full amount of vitamin A so you can have a deficiency just from that I done a lot of it is in the gall bladder I information alcohol will affect the liver and decrease the ability of jord varo may also if you have any type of IBS or irritable bowel syndrome or inflammation or : or damage in the colon let for example you had gastric bypass where they removed part of the colon or bypassed it or damaged in the digestive system from antibiotics that can limit your absorption of vitamin A so these are all potential reasons that you could be vitamin A deficient despite consuming vitamin A in your diet or it could be that you consuming vitamin A maybe you and you don products so you pre vitamin A compounds and that could create a deficiency right there so if you have this condition you would want to number one make sure you get it from foods this is a good source and then you want to isolate the factors that could be preventing the absorption could be any one of these alright thanks for watching if you please subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
Why People Shrink With Age and How to Prevent Shrinking? Â Dr .Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cf33DCzuqk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so let they age especially women women actually shrink more than men why is that and what can we do to prevent that you don want to wait until you or 4 inches shorter and try to reverse that it now so a person potentially could lose a quarter to a half an inch every decade after 40 so by the time they they okay why is that and what can we do to prevent that we disk space between the vertebra and we vertebra itself so one of the big myths out there is that people think that they can grow bone by drinking more milk well cows and horses have these huge legs they supporting a very large animal and they don actually are eating grass so there is no credible study that I could find that shows that drinking milk will build your bones or make them stronger now what about calcium well there problem with calcium especially when if postmenopausal women take calcium to prevent bone loss especially if it calcium carbonate they increase their risk of getting heart attacks I did a separate video on that you can check it out but when we talk about minerals we piece of the puzzle you need other minerals you need vitamins you especially need magnesium and this trace mineral called boron borne is really really essential to help prevent osteopenia and osteoporosis okay so get your calcium you can get that from leafy greens and maybe a little high-quality organic grass-fed dairy okay number two vitamin d3 and k2 these are fat soluble vitamins these are really important in mobilizing and transporting not just calcium but magnesium as well so vitamin D helps the absorption of calcium from the small intestine by 20 times a k2 drives that calcium from the blood into the bone so vitamin k2 as compared to k1 triggers proteins that keep your bones really really strong where do you get k2 from well from fatty foods which a lot of people are on low fat diets and they don it from the Sun but of course as you age you don the skin and you have to actually be in the Sun for a certain amount of time expose enough of your body to the sunlight to get what you really need from vitamin d3 so my recommendation is to take both of these as a supplement especially for getting older and you just want to make sure you enough to avoid osteopenia things like that this is a big one number three low estrogen okay and I women after menopause so when you in estrogen it build bone you actually break bone down more than you this is usually coming because the adrenal glands which are supposed to be backing up the ovaries during menopause are not making enough estrogen so you have the ovaries and the adrenal glands that make estrogen going into menopause if your adrenals are too exhausted as an adrenal fatigue you get this situation where you get too much cortisol and not enough estrogen production thus hot flashes and other problems but cortisol if too high can create a catabolic effect and start breaking down bone so that actually lose their height right there and then number five low protein they not consuming enough high quality protein you people have a deficiency of protein and I 50% of most protein foods end up as waste so when you consume protein you have the quality of protein where it comes from and then you factory of how many essential amino acids that are in there you to have eight essential amino acids if you don acids so if you don essential amino acids those building blocks you cannot build body tissue same thing with branch amino acids and then if you don that if you have gut issues there issues with this right here I another video very soon let not exercising okay exercise does help prevent bone loss because you a stress and your body is compensating by making it stronger the whole structural frame number seven growth hormone and also something called IGF number one I want to discuss that and this next slide is very very important growth hormone as you age you lose your ability to make growth hormone the pituitary makes growth on them and it works through the liver and then it triggers this other hormone called igf-1 which has very similar functions to growth hormone so both of these decrease as you age so if you and you don don what can you do to maximize growth hormone you can keep your insulin low and your Sugar hmm that sounds like Kido to me okay next one you want to get more sleep okay and less stress that will increase growth hormone as well in fact a good amount of the growth hormone is elevated while you delta-wave sleep so if you sleeping you produce enough growth hormone and that when all the repair happens all the recovery and actual bone growth itself exercise high-intensity interval training has the potential to increase growth hormone by 700 percent but this is mainly if you sprinting so if you hardcore sprinting it could be less than that and realize everyone and this was just one study so it could be less it could be a little bit more but high-intensity interval training is the way to go but do it graduate first so you don important and increasing growth hormone lots of Sun or take it as a supplement but this right here is probably the most potent stimulator of growth hormone and that increase growth hormone by 1,300 to 2000% when you do in a minute fasting so again intamin fasting will help you get younger and in talking about your bones as well so the more the story is don wait until you shorter do something now as a preventative measure if you this content please subscribe now and I will

SULFUR: The Most Important Element in Detoxification Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq9ZNd3ToSs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we sulfur is the most important element in detoxification now in the liver you have various enzymes that turn poisons and toxins into harmless particles and a lot of these enzymes are software-based so phase one you fat-soluble chemical or poison to a water-soluble chemical enzymes can do that Phase two takes that water-soluble compound and makes it less poisonous even more and then phase three it exits the cell and is removed from the body and you need sulfur to make these enzymes work software is also involved in three very important amino acids that our cofactors to help make glutathione which is one of the most important antioxidants in the body also sulfur is involved in two vitamins biotin and thymine which is b1 now there detoxification as well like vitamin A B 2 B 3 B 9 which is folate vitamin C and vitamin E but sulfur is the most important one now where do you can suffer cruciferous like radish kale brussel sprouts asparagus garlic onion eggs fish cheese oh and by the way go ahead and comment below on which one of these you like the most I content please subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
Why Women Live Longer than Men? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO5YeDZ-jRE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today I want to answer the question why do women live longer than men men on average live 76 years women 81 years why is that well it has to do with one hormone estrogen now let me explain in the body you have this constant battle or this balance between oxidation and antioxidants so whether it stress too much sugar that produces all this oxidation you also have from the food antioxidants and your body actually makes antioxidants to counter this oxidation if we have too much oxidation at the genetic level and not enough antioxidants we get a buildup of free radicals now what does that mean free radical is an unpaired electron so we have this little atom with electrons and normally we would have to that balance each other so if we only had one that would be unpaired electrons creating a very unstable atom and then that really creates the damage I about damage within the DNA and various proteins in the body but estrogen can come in as a very powerful antioxidant and actually give you what you need to balance out the oxidation and on top of that we have something called phytoestrogens from plants okay cruciferous vegetables for example that can also help the antioxidant networks as well you have genes which are like the hardware very similar to let have a DVD that ok it it has a playlist for example then you have something called a DVD player to be able to use the discs you cannot extract data from that DVD unless you have the player so the genes are the DVD which encodes all the information and you can information unless you have the player well that is epigenetics epigenetics means above genetics and there things in the environment that express these genes or turn them on or turn them off like nutrients stress levels exercise fasting and hormones and estrogen has the capacity to cause certain longevity genes to be expressed or to be turned on so yes women have to go through the pain of pregnancy having the menstrual cycle menopause but they get to live longer by five years thanks for watching if you content please subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
The Best Vitamin for Tuberculosis (TB) Â Dr.Berg On Vitamin D3 Benefits	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWnUiSuVgj8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so recently on my YouTube channel someone asked a question what would be good for TV ok the infection tuberculosis so let hands down the number one vitamin that someone needs if they have TB is vitamin d3 there people that have TB that are very very low in vitamin d3 and there really interesting studies going on right now and that are already out there that show that taking vitamin d3 can actually speed up the recovery lessen the symptoms and even put the person in remission okay so that is that because d3 is an immune modulator which means that it controls the immune system if you vitamin d3 you getting an infection from either a virus or bacteria and this is why a lot of people get sick during the winter because they have low amounts of vitamin D not to mention 2 billion people on this planet are deficient in d3 a couple reasons why they people just don they used to number two it difficult to even get your RDAs from food so if you not on the food chances are you to be deficient as you age you lose the ability to absorb vitamin d3 the darker your skin the more vitamin d3 you need as well and even if you your skin exposed to the Sun depending on where you live as far as how far you are from the equator can really limit your ability to absorb the Sun so your body can then turn into vitamin D also there your liver is fatty if you have a bad liver or you don you not going to be able to absorb that vitamin D too well and microbes himself have the sneaky little strategy that they can block the vitamin D receptor as well like for example epstein-barr virus will inhibit your ability to absorb vitamin d so it can then survive even the microbe TB can inhibit your absorption about it and the AIDS virus is worse because it can completely stop your ability to absorb vitamin D and there thing that and that is a genetic defect a lot of people have it it and if you have a certain genetic variant for a gene but you can vitamin D you unless you take larger amounts there test that you can get it 23andme that they can evaluate your genetics and tell you if you have certain genetic weaknesses for certain things but getting back to tuberculosis you would want to take 20,000 I use per day with your meals you might also want to take vitamin k2 with it 200 micrograms mk7 version and this will start helping to build up your immune system and put this macro back in remission thanks for watching if you liking this content please subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
Why is There a Major Zinc Deficiency Problem in India and Pakistan? - Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h93KKivvIPM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today I want to talk about an actual big problem that and Pakistan it micronutrient is zinc this is a major problem with not having enough zinc especially in pregnant lactating women and small children and the reason for this is that zinc is involved in so many biochemical reactions in the body it enzymes now and when I say a cofactor for a thousand enzymes I have to define what that means okay cofactors are helper molecules and an enzyme is a type of protein now when you think about proteins you may think about enzymes when you when you actually eat food you also may think of hair nail skin but proteins go way beyond that proteins are involved in many many things DNA repair detoxification building your immune system so nearly all the structural parts of our body like tendons ligaments connective tissue our protein but also the functional parts as well the little proteins that do the work of the body that take food turn into body tissue and then take tissue and recycle it gets rid of waste it many factors so if someone is deficient in zinc here are just a few things that may occur number one is diarrhea that big symptoms a problem with this symptom is that diarrhea also will cause a major deficiency of zinc because you to lose your electrolytes under weight because zinc is involved in metabolism stunted growth because zinc is involved in a growing body cognitive defects so memory lack of attention focus and even IQ susceptibility to malaria pneumonia and viruses this is why a lot of people take zinc when they get sick because it actually helps your immune system and actually help support the proteins involved in your immune system skin problems that could be dermatitis psoriasis dandruff all sorts of skin problems stomach ulcers low testosterone alopecia which is a loss of hair different patches that way zinc is involved in a lot of autoimmune conditions and if you have a lot of inflammation in the body as well and of course a low thyroid all right so now the question is why is there such a massive deficiency and by the way two billion people worldwide are deficient in zinc number one reason is phytic acid when it this is a chemical compound naturally found in bran in the rice and the grains it nuts in corn nuts being raw almonds and especially raw walnuts okay because when you heat it you can actually destroy this phytic acid another name for finding acid is phytates so if you especially brown rice by the way or whole grains you levels of phytic acid and that is going to bind the zinc and it create a zinc deficiency especially if your diet is mostly these foods okay and of course this relates to the next one being a vegan now the best source of zinc and I bioavailability is is animal products like beef and it oysters fish lamb and if you are a vegan or you just can doing mostly grains or cereals you gonna get a zinc deficiency and diarrhea I say for example you have an infection that a microbe that can set you up for a zinc deficiency and let you white flour products okay as in refined grains well guess what refined grains and refined sugars will actually cause a zinc deficiency itself so not only do we have the whole grains we have the refined grains causing this zinc deficiency creating a lot of problems all right in summary if you know someone who they enough foods that are high in zinc I put a link down below so you can get more data on that also children make sure they include not just sink but all the trace minerals very important like iodine selenium and even iron and lastly and most importantly get them on a healthy keto plan to avoid these foods that are not cute a friendly and that way you don in the first place thanks for watching if you this content please subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
Burning Throat Syndrome or Silent Acid Reflux Causes Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzC95NphH5w	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today let called burning throat syndrome or another name for that would be silent acid reflux which is basically the same thing that is a situation where you having acid coming up through this valve up into the esophagus from the stomach creating a lot of irritation in the throat area but not necessarily in the stomach area so this acid is extremely acidic between one in three that battery acid now the stomach you have this protecting liner but in the esophagus you don there is some irritation up here so you that can lead to a sore throat the vocal cords it to speak then you have frequent sorry throat clearings coughing pain in the sternum which is that breast bone right through in here so the medical name for this is laryngeal pharyngeal reflex the larynx is like the voice box right above it you have with something called the pharynx which is in the back part of the throat area and it can affect both of those areas because acid is splashing up through here there GERD which is involving this valve not closing that can also create these symptoms so here is controlled by three things okay number one the pH of the stomach so if this acid is not a stood enough it relatively a little more alkaline than it should be the valve won this is why I always recommend apple cider vinegar pertain how to chloride to help the situation number two it could be a problem with the autonomic nervous system because the nervous system controls this valve so what happens when you the vascular supply to the nervous system so you have a problem with the nerves and your feet causing peripheral neuropathy you have a problem with the nerve and your eye the retina okay which you can go blind you can also have a problem with the nerve in the ear which can affect ringing the ears or even deafness you can have a problem with any part of the nervous system including the autonomic nervous system and have a problem with this valve as well but there it gastrin gastrin is the hormone that makes gastric acid and if you have enough then you have enough acid and just as a side note gastric acid is not just hydrochloric acid it also has sodium chloride and potassium chloride so you actually need salt and potassium to make gastric acid but there vitamin D deficient you could actually have a lowered amount of gastrin lower amounts of this hormone create lower amounts of this acid and this is going to affect the valve it close tightly and the acid can go right through here so what do you do about it well one thing is you take the chain hunter chloride hop cider vinegar that doesn work make sure you salt potassium from your diet but also take some vitamin D you could be deficient and that could be the reason why you have this acid that through here alright thanks for watching if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success

What is Tonsils & Do You Need Them? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_igjDskDZI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so what do the tonsils do and do we really need them people have been told that you don okay they and you can do fine just without them well the people that are telling you that usually are in the business of removing them you don organs that you don all of your organs they have a purpose they wouldn a reason for that the tonsils are primarily involved with protecting the microbes from getting down into the lung and creating a respiratory infection in fact removing the tonsils increases the person infection so there t-cells and they start creating antibodies and they start to start this through immune response to protect you you also have lymphatic tissue in your armpits as well to protect microbes from going down into different extremities and when we we four different tonsils or you can look at them is like this tissue lymph tissue that throat area a little higher up a little lower and they kind of protect microbes from going deeper into the body now the two remedies that support the lymph system to make sure that they can do their job a lot better zinc and vitamin D okay now the other thing that I have observed with people that have chronic tonsil infections or swollen tonsils they almost always on a diet that in sugar or high in dairy products okay like milk and lastly you want to add in fasting you may even find that your time your appetite goes away and your body naturally trying to get you to fast the fasting is really important in strengthening the immune system thanks for watching if you content please subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
What Is Epigenetics: In Simple Terms - DNA Sequencing Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g12kIu9jrIk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today I want to define a word epigenetics in very simple terms now you it just explain where it is so you have the genes and genes are small sections of the DNA the DNA is the blueprint instructions for building a body and this DNA gets copied as something called RNA it is a double strand RNA would be a single strand so there that unzips this makes a copy to at once and then the RNA goes outside the center of the nucleus of the cell and goes to a protein factory where it makes body tissue different proteins so that basically what DNA is and then a section of the DNA would be a gene so this right here would be compared to a CD on a CD you have the song you have the artist and you have the playlist in a certain order another example would be sheet music okay for a song on the piano you have you have all these different notes in a certain sequence and the sheet music is basically the instructions on how to create this song but you need someone to do something with that music you need some someone to play the CD that above genetics the DNA or gene is not set in stone so just because you have certain genetics doesn it your environment okay so the environment is what triggers turning on or turning off these genes and what I about is activating the gene to turn on to be turned into a certain protein and do a certain function if something is not turned on its silenced okay that turn it turns it off versus turning it on which means that gene is expressed so expressed means turn on silence means turned off now some triggers with epigenetics be your environment like what you eat the nutrients in the food when you eat and when you fasting temperature cold heat the stress level sleep exercise the type of exercise you do your mood can affect your genes okay your state of mind could affect your genes which is pretty cool your age will affect your genes so it really only 1% of the genetics that differentiates us from someone else and this is important to understand because you have to realize that you are in charge of your DNA okay you the effect of these genes as you might think you can do something about these genes and it has to do with your environment and what you eat what you don fasting your stress level your recovery all right that terms thanks for watching if you liking this content please subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
Lesson From Spanish Flu Pandemic Of 1918 - Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyrcYVH6qtU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I learned from the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918 a very interesting story not sure if you know about this but back in 1918 fifty to a hundred million people died worldwide of this Spanish flu now that many people would died worldwide just out of the blue and there interesting things about this okay number one they didn virus itself okay the virus was involved but it wasn fairly recently they did autopsies on some bodies that they dug up from this time period and they found something very interesting they found that the majority of deaths occurred because of these two things right here ARDS which is acute respiratory distress syndrome which is a situation where the lung is filling up with fluid so the alveoli in the lung which exchanged the oxygen and the co2 basically just filled up with fluid and the fluid got outside the lung and the person basically drownded within their own fluid there was also a lot of mucus in there so the mucus kind of got stuck in the lung on top of that there was a super infection involving bacteria okay so the combination of bacteria with this fluid created the deaths now there are some other things that were very very strange as well because a good portion of these deaths involved people in their 20s normally the flu affects young children and elderly people not in this situation so I minute but first I want to tell you what occurred about four years previous to this event okay well 1918 you got 1914 you had World War one okay that was worldwide what are some of the changes that occurred well we had a huge shift in diet because we had to transport food great distances and you have to preserve the food so they did a lot of canning okay and by the way when you canned food you really do increase the zinc in food now zinc important in the immune system just slightly so we have the transportation of food change and the food change not only occurred with the military but it occurred with people at home as well because they did food rationing no longer did you have the variety of food the fresh vegetables you had several foods a good amount of it was preserved okay so what does this mean it basically means we created a lot of nutritional deficiencies if you create these nutritional deficiencies over a period of four years you to increase the susceptibility to get any infection now the next question that I wanted to know is what month did the Spanish flu a curb take a while guess if you guess January you are correct now what is unique about the month January January is at the peak of vitamin D deficiencies and when you have a low vitamin D your immune system just does not work that well in fact vitamin D innervates every single white blood cell and without enough vitamin D the risk factor of getting lung problems like ARDS or pneumonia go way up also asthma as well so vitamin D helps your lungs it acts as cortisol it anti-inflammatory helps your immune system and when you you I chart and I this is basically a chart of the seasons of the year and what type of illnesses people get if you look at the winter months you have a huge increase in risk of getting upper respiratory tract infections increase relapses of MS which is an autoimmune disease and other autoimmune diseases okay because vitamin D is involved with that also increase risk of getting F seen bar virus coming out of remission Rhino virus which is all the sign of stuff type 1 diabetes risk factors go up as well as an increased risk of getting bacterial infections but not only that children that are born in the winter months have higher risks of a mess down the road and ulcerative colitis and there mothers getting gestational diabetes fascinating so vitamin D is really really important in your immune system so as you can see there storm we have a virus involved we have nutritional deficiencies that are setting the person up for these infections we have low vitamin D but why did so many people die in their 20s okay well this is why during that period of time bear as in Bayer Aspirin ran out of their patents okay so you had a lot of other companies coming in to sell and make aspirin now at that time they didn effects of high levels of aspirin they were giving people 1300 milligrams every single hour for 12 hours okay and one of the side effects of doing that is pulmonary edema which is going to fill up the lungs with fluid and another side effect is to increase the bacteria loans now the combination of the aspirin and the vitamin D deficiency and other nutritional deficiencies altogether was responsible for those deaths so what have I learned from this I importance of nutrients and preventing health problems you see when someone has a health problem very rarely do they look at the nutritional deficiency condition that set them up for getting sick but it is one of the most important factors in bulletproofing your immune system but the problem is here you have people that eat junk food and they exposed to pollution and toxins in the environment but you really can deficiency of something it no problem of omission it doesn your attention because it don deficiency it could be subclinical the only way you someone tells you number one the importance in this link of nutritional deficiencies and bulletproofing your immune system and also in addition to that the key foods that you to be focusing on to make sure that you and for that I

What Is Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Or Lou Gehrig's Disease? Â Dr.Berg On ALS Symptoms	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shxB16oL3qo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today I condition called Amy trophic lateral sclerosis ALS or Lou Gehrig and the reason I this is that I had a guy who came and wheelchair to my summits this weekend and some of you that are watching were there and it was really good to meet you and those that weren you next year but this gentleman who came to the summit was in remission for an entire year and he was just doing two of the things that I ketogenic diet and in a minute fasting so I told him I was gonna do a more complete video to give him some additional information now when you look up this condition on the internet there are site after site they pretty much talk about the prognosis it progressive neurodegenerative condition talk about you five years talk about the symptoms muscle wasting difficulty speech respiratory failure atrophy of the muscles but they don what to do about this condition so if you look at all the details of this condition and the fact that 30,000 people your get it well that nice to know but we want to know how do we improve this condition and this is what I data I my studies so if you happen to have a gerbil or hamster and they have this condition definitely put them on this but I think this data also applies to humans is this information going to cure you I have no idea is it going to prevent the problem I don even know if it things however I do know there of information related to these nutrients in the support of the nervous system so the first thing I want to recommend is 20,000 I use of vitamin D I exactly what vitamin D is it the most important thing that you can take because if you are deficient the progressive decline of your health is about four times as fast and you will not live as long so vitamin D is crucial vitamin D is not really a vitamin it steroid it acts very similar to cortisol and by the way cortisol or prednisone which is a synthetic version is one of the main treatments for these autoimmune conditions the next thing I would recommend is ketones get on the healthy version of the ketogenic diet I put a link down below why because ketones support the nervous system and they protect their nervous system very important I would also recommend taking MCT oil to raise your ketones for sure just start off by taking about a half a teaspoon don take too much because it can create some digestive issues next scene and very very important is intermittent fasting and this is good for any type of autoimmune condition because it lowers inflammation and there is an inflammatory state in the nerve cells also when you you get a major improvement in your immune system especially the stem cells especially if you do periodic prolonged fasting next thing is zinc very important in the immune system mostly Barre deficient also zinc will help protect against respiratory failure but when you take zinc it can throw off your copper so I recommend you get a product that has both zinc and copper together read the back the label whatever the directions say to take go ahead and follow that b12 is also important because it supports the myelin around the nerve next thing is vitamin E make sure you get a natural version a food complex vitamin E is a very powerful antioxidant when you have this autoimmune condition you of free radicals and that creates a lot of collateral destruction from the inflammation so this can help mitigate that alright last thing is DHA this is a type of omega-3 fatty acid DHA makes up the structural part of the brain in the nervous system so here you are having a progressive neurodegenerative condition well why not take the raw material necessary to out feed that last thing I would recommend is to get a really good water purifier so you tap water because who knows what the water and the chemicals that you you want to do organic you want to do very very healthy nutrient-dense foods and you want to minimize any exposure to chemicals alright thanks for watching if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success

Diabetic And Pregnant? Risks Of Diabetic Pregnancy & Insulin Resistance Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szcdGeKyM_U	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I want to talk about pregnancy and diabetes okay if you you you need to know in fact if you pregnant you pregnant and you have insulin resistance which is a lot more common in fact probably I would say 65% of women who are pregnant that are not diabetic usually have insulin resistance this video is for you first let me just define insulin resistance this is a condition where your body is not able to absorb insulin which means that when insulin is triggered by carbohydrates it doesn what happens is your body has to make more insulin than it needs and that excess insulin creates a lot of problems if you check the blood sugars your blood sugars may be normal okay because of the excess amount of insulin that generated keeping your blood Sugar normal but your the big problem underneath the surface you have high amounts of insulin this is the test that can be done to check that it Homa - I are I would definitely get this test before you get pregnant because you want to know if you have insulin resistance because it creates a lot of problems so if you pre-diabetic or II have insulin resistance and you become pregnant the insulin resistance part gets worse why because it fetus is going to demand more fuel and so your body is as a protective mechanism it resistance on you so it shunning to the baby the problem is that if you have insulin resistance already going into this things get worse and you may become a diabetic and this is probably the reason why women get gestational diabetes during pregnancy they already are going into this with insulin resistance now if you diabetic and you the diabetes tends to get worse because of this fact right here now the problem is the complications from you having blood sugar issues whether it resistance pre-diabetes or diabetes there complications for the baby one is that they more likely become a stillbirth and just being a diabetic you may find that you in the first place the baby might have a stunted growth birth defects preeclampsia that three things high blood pressure protein in the urine and swelling in your hands and feet eclampsia is basically when you get seizures and a lot of other problems like you you can even die from that so these are three things that you need to be aware of right here but that could be coming from the blood sugar issue now the big problem of having insulin resistance in addition to being a diabetic or being a pre-diabetic is that your ability to absorb these nutrients is impaired okay you can talking about vitamin C vitamin A vitamin E magnesium potassium manganese zinc chromium selenium folate b1 biotin and these nutrients are essential to prevent these complications so you have a double-edged sword the insulin resistance is creating the inability for these vitamins to go in your body and these deficiencies now are creating more insulin resistance this is why if you thinking about getting pregnant or you insulin resistance you better be taking these vitamins or eating food high in these nutrients vital vital vital to prevent these complications in other words the blood sugar issues the insulin resistance the diabetes severely depletes you of nutrients and you have complications so if you you take these nutrients these complications really diminish alright and the last question is how do you know if you have insulin resistance well you can get the test whole myir or you can actually go by symptoms as well do you have belly fat do you have frequent urination at night do you find that when you eat you after a meal you need a little sweet after you eat or you eat lunch or you have low blood sugar symptoms let cannot go very long without a meal before becoming lightheaded or highly irritable I mean think about how many women have these symptoms when they pregnant the best place to start is well before you become pregnant but if you already pregnant I would recommend getting on the healthy version of the ketogenic diet it starts in a minute fasting goes definitely do that before you pregnant okay or you sure that we don foods that have these nutrients in them all right thanks for watching if you liking this content please subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
Can Calorie Restriction Slow Aging? Â Side Effects of Low Calorie Diet Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-H_eX97M8Q	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so you may have heard this before maybe another video this concept of restricting calories and living longer it animals insects bacteria and yeast and mice that if you actually cut their calories they live longer but that conflicts with all the people that have done low calorie diets in the past it been proven that the more you diet and you lower your calories you end up gaining the weight back becoming bigger and really struggling to stay on any diet and not only that it destroys your metabolism over time so how could the restriction of calories end up making you healthier and live longer that what I want to talk about so a couple things most of the studies out there we have been some studies done on humans using the fasting mimicking diet where you a day there called 5 and 2 okay where you can pretty much eat what you want 5 days out of the week but 2 of the days you 500 calories per day so you restricting your calories so there are a couple problems with this and there some problems with this as well when you do the fasting mimicking diet you doing this for any period of time you for a short period of time and then you like a diet which I don because what happens when you fasting you can pretty much eat whatever you want and that is something that not very workable the other big problem when you lower calories is what are those calories made up of if you doing low calories but higher carbs you up and down up and down up and down so you actually be very uncomfortable you gonna be very weak you irritable ok I before the only thing in my mind is that big pizza I as I get off the diet and then you have people that do low calorie and they doing with low fat that is going to stimulate a lot of hunger again very uncomfortable not sustainable and this is a real big problem people go on diets blood sugar issues hungry all the time you the program you wrong foods and you over and over again and every time you do this you destroy your metabolism a little bit more a little bit more so let you restrict calories the benefit is epigenetics okay epigenetics means above genetics so you have certain amount of genes and then you have the things that trigger these genes it and the genes that affect longevity and weight loss have to do with really lowering your glucose and your insulin these are the two powerful triggers for the benefits of the calorie restriction not the fact that you calories but that you glucose in insulin this is where the benefits come from right here the other big problem I see when people do low calories is they lower the nutrients and they create nutritional deficiencies especially if they do it long term they end up with all sorts of problems but if you recommend I do not recommend trying to restrict your calories I recommend you glucose and that that will indirectly lower your insulin because so a low carb diet very very important but not at low fat diet so you want to increase your fat moderate protein lower your carbs what will happen is your body now shift it metabolism over to fat burning your hunger is gonna go away it very easy to do you the blood sugar issues why because your carbs are low it your carbs low and keeping you in fat-burning it comfortable and even pleasurable when you your hunger goes away and this makes it sustainable so instead of going low calorie or doing a 500 calorie meal I recommend you do intra minute fasting okay so you any food as long as you can okay until you why because that insulin okay and when you insulin all sorts of things happen on the epigenetic level and the genetic level as well you definitely live longer you can have a lot of health benefits and when you go from three meals a day down to two meals a day down to one meal a day you your calories because there you would consume in three meals in one meal but it lowering calories that makes the difference it focus on calorie restriction focus on healthy keto which is low carb higher fat focus on nutrient-dense foods so you have no malnutrition as well as infrequent eating so this way it sustainable you can do it long-term it and you feel good thanks for watching if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success

The Benefits of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-8mZBkgKfQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let therapy hands down this is one of most incredible therapies it very credible it researched with hardcore science by the military it are even getting reimbursed from their insurance so how does it work when you breathe air you 21% actual oxygen so hyperbaric oxygen therapy raises that oxygen to nearly a hundred percent and you pressurized closed environment so the oxygen can not just go into your lung it goes right in your tissues and it goes into your blood and your blood carries you to the organs and it basically feeds the different tissues that have hypoxia and that it could be from some trauma or infection or from anything so simply it concentrated oxygen into injured tissues it also has the capacity to stimulate stem cells by 800% stem cells are basically undifferentiated cells there are cells that don turn into certain cells so this therapy targets things like dementia stroke heart problems definitely things like angina or coronary heart disease asthma other lung conditions like COPD and the Simo inflammatory conditions like autoimmune conditions especially things like ms brain trauma carbon dioxide poisoning anemia inflammation after injuries unhealing wounds it has a profound effect on your DNA in genes but to start affecting the genes you between 25 and 35 treatments over a period of time it has the capacity to explode mitochondria in tumor cells the mitochondria have a different type of metabolism there they no longer have the respiratory type of tableaus and they have the metabolism that sugar and when that happens these tumor or cancer cells don live forever and they keep growing they keep dividing so we don in our bodies this is a great therapy for tumors and even cancer one common factor of tumors is something called angiogenesis and that basically is new blood vessels that feed the tumor because the tumor needs a lot of oxygen and nutrients in fact it tends to hog all the fuel the glucose but without those blood vessels it can this therapy has the ability to shrink or inhibit angiogenesis what triggers angiogenesis is basically hypoxia a lack of oxygen so if you give the body oxygen it won stress disorder now as far as the time that you hours maybe three times a week for several weeks it really depends on what you there doing it for maintenance or anti-aging so you can get this several ways one is just doing a search in your area hyperbaric oxygen therapy near me and finding a place that you can go to and get this done probably get a prescription from your doctor some people actually buy or rent a unit and bring it in their home but it valid and credible and effective therapy so check it out if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
Why the Strong Ammonia Odor in My Urine on Keto? Foul Smelling Urine on Ketogenic Diet Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRgZWS5iScs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we your urine may give off a strong ammonia odor when you the byproduct of protein now what normally should happen is when you consume protein some of it goes to the tissues some of it is used as fuel and the rest goes through waste through your urine okay as urea so ammonia is the intermediate step between protein and urea now if you have liver damage let say you have cirrhosis this cycle here gets interrupted and you start building up too much ammonia and that can back up in the blood and be very toxic however there is another condition where you can have ammonia in the urine and it toxic and here triggers the production of ammonia and I blood becomes slightly too acidic you trigger the production of ammonia sometimes up to five to ten X and why is that because ammonia is extremely alkaline it lower it becomes more acidic as you go higher becomes more alkaline now just to give you more reality on the pH scale seven is neutral six is acidic eight is alkaline when you go from seven to eight eight is ten times more alkaline and six is ten times more acidic so it power of ten so if we eleven point seven this is extremely alkaline so ammonia is there to buffer the acidic pH now this is not a bad thing and you don worry about especially if you don liver damage or cirrhosis so basically you becoming more acid to balance that out your body makes a little more ammonia what you could do is increase the amount of vegetables to increase your alkaline minerals magnesium and potassium because if the pH is not overly acidic you won have this ammonia but if you ketosis and then you add intermittent fasting you more ketones and you may have some ammonia nothing to worry about alright thanks for watching if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
Is it Bad to Crack Your Own Neck? Neck Cracking Side Effects Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4W-v9JD2eM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	in this video I want to answer the question is it bad to crack your neck okay you see people all the time they cracking their neck here in your neck you have joints that are either hyper mobile that means they move too much okay usually in the mid part right through here and then you have other joints that are hypo mobile they fixated so when you just yourself most of the time you one you hypermobile joints and it looser and looser and looser and it gonna cause the need to continue to do this over and over and over and over again now I got interested in Chiropractic College when I was in ninth grade my grandfather was a chiropractor he graduated in 1920 never met him and I don so his ninth grade was in wrestling hurt myself mother took me to the chiropractor so I laid on this table I didn he gave me an adjustment I got this incredible relief from this pain that I had so I set it pretty quickly and started talking to him about it and I decided right there I want to do this because the amount of a relief you can give people so I decided I wanted to be a chiropractor when I was nine great so when I got into school the last year you basically had to practice on each other so for the next year we became human guinea pigs for getting adjusted and of course when you first start out you don lot of people working on me that are doing it wrong and it basically took me two or three years to recover from having severely hypermobile joints in fact I remember one time my roommate adjusted me the wrong way and my sinus got clogged up so I went into the clinic and had someone readjust it the other way and it just cleared right out so my viewpoint is this and I know that sometimes chiropractors get a bad rap you know once you go you also have to go but if you find a good chiropractor that is honest that knows what they that is very competent that can only adjust what you need to have adjust it there nothing better I remember after I graduated going back home and going to visit the chiropractor that used to work with my grandfather so he practice for something like 65 years right he in practice he everyone in town so I wanted him to adjust me and he laid me down he just put his fingers right down my spine went in there it was the most incredible treatment that I chiropractor so if you can find someone that be worth it but here you have to be treated over and over and over because that your T bro segment is not staying in place there something else going on either nutritionally or with the diet or referred pain if the gallbladder for example is a problem that can refer pain up to the right side and literally pull these vertebra out of place if your teeth aren went to the dentist and you have some teeth work and now they don close right that will put tension on your jaw and your neck and it can throw off the entire spine so there problems that can be referred there lot of inflammatory things can happen for mold injuries this is why we do intermittent fasting in ketosis so instead of cracking your neck I would do more stretches and if it cracks in the process of stretching that fine anyway thanks for watching	Success
What Is Oxidation Â Dr.Berg on Free Radicals and Antioxidants	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Oowx4269Ig	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we oxidation okay a very exciting topic originally this meant adding oxygen to a compound and the loosening of an electron okay when you lose an electron from an atom you create a free radical so these atoms have paired electrons as an example you have this plate and you and it has two weights on it and you can balance that plate as you spin it okay but a free radical is when you remove an electron and you have what unpaired electron so it just has one weight on a plate and you this thing well guess what it fly off and break something well in the body it DNA etc so that radicals okay and it could come from adding an oxygen to some other compound now the definition has expanded to the creation of free radicals without the oxygen another example would be biting into an apple if you leave it exposed to oxygen it but if you add an antioxidant like lemon it doesn antioxidant does is it donates an electron to make things more symmetrical and stabilize this atom and antioxidants always come in a group or a network in the food this is why when an antioxidant donates it becomes now unstable and it needs to borrow from another antioxidant and this is why you need a network of antioxidants so let me give you some examples of an oxidant the top oxidizer is glucose okay so what if you have high sugar in your blood your body it oxidation okay it don just need to know this is oxidation on steroids so you have all this oxidation all this free radical damage from consuming a lot of glucose now it interesting when you consume antioxidants and a lot of different nutrients act isn zinc lynnium even though there are minerals they they act like an antioxidant then you have vitamin E vitamin C even vitamin D and even ketones can all act as an antioxidant to reduce the complications of diabetes for example and that it damage control but glucose is at the top of the list next one vegetable oils highly unstable they stabilize them but typically they omega-6 fatty acid that becomes very unstable I in a second and then we have iron think about when you have like rust if you combine oxygen with iron you get rust so iron and very high amounts in your body is very very dangerous because it going to create a lot of oxidation so a deficiency of iron is very very dangerous but an excess is also very dangerous pollution and the environment chemicals in the environment and just having low antioxidants because you don actually create an imbalance so when you have too much oxidation versus antioxidants that stress okay because it now let oil which is really not even vegetable oil it mostly GMO we cottonseed in canola these are the four GMO vegetables that you see in the grocery store in so many of your products highly processed has trace amounts of glyphosate which is an herbicide and it can create this thing called advanced lipid oxidation end products so it creates more free radicals it creates inflammation in the body and it depletes the antioxidant so it depletes you about it mancine on a mini vitamin A and that problems when people go to restaurants or they go to fast food restaurants they reheating it over and over and over and they might reuse this for a week or two weeks and it all ends up as this dark highly processed highly oxidized grease in a grease pit and there are certain companies that come along and we restaurant grease because you can it into the sewage and they will take it back to the plant and they will recycle it okay and guess where they put it back into animal feeds I printed this off one of the websites and one of the companies and this there here that oils are produced from the freshest recycle raw material freshest really and stabilized with ethoxy Quinn for maximum shelf life now what is it that foxy Quinn Heath AXI Quinn was developed by take a well guess Monsanto in the 50s he foxy Quinn was initially registered as a pesticide then in 1965 reclassified as an antioxidant interesting he foxy queen is allowed in the fish industry in Norway as a feed stabilizer so is commonly used in food pellets fed to farm salmon not well caught by the way ethoxy Quinn is used in pellets to feed chickens on chicken farms in 2017 the European Union suspended authorization for use as a feed additive of course in America we still use it welcome to America the agency and I talking about the agency in Europe found one of its metabolites to be geno toxic that means toxic to your genes in mutagenic that means it can generate mutations so this is just another reason why to do keto healthily okay for you for those of you that are new I put a link down below but if you restaurant realize you might be getting some of these oils alright thanks if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
What is Snoring & How to Get Your Spouse to Stop Snoring? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0XBe4eLDGA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we your spouse to stop snoring there of sleep than having your spouse snore all night long so let actual cause of snoring now there lot of things you can do to cope with this problem if it the CPAP machine which is a device which hooks on your head and it will give you forced air so you can breathe the problem is it dries out your mouth it uncomfortable to have this thing over your head and there devices that you can put in your mouth too cause the jaw to go forward to create more of an opening so you can breathe but sooner or later you want to get to the root cause but first let talk about what is snoring snoring is a loss of tone in the structures in the back of the throat that caused a vibrational sound and this could be coming from the fact that your neck is just too large you have too much fat in your neck and that and this obstruction is called obstructive sleep apnea it can also come from the abdomen let you have visceral fat you have your large belly and all that extra fat is putting pressure up into your diaphragm especially when you constant pressure in your diaphragm is going to limit the amount of oxygen that you have in your lung and there big correlation between people who snore and they hand we have something functional in other words your nervous system controls the tone of the structures in the back of the throat and I autonomic nervous system if there problem with certain cranial nerves and these are nerves that come out of the brainstem specifically the ninth cranial nerve which is the glossopharyngeal and the tenth cranial nerve which is the vagus that can also create a loss of tone and the back part of the throat creating this vibration and then there another nerve called the phrenic nerve which comes from underneath the diaphragm that goes up into the neck and the freq nerve controls the diaphragm and the amount of air that your lungs can actually get so if there with the nervous system it can create a huge effect not just on snoring but the amount of air that actually comes in your body through the lungs working correctly and also from the Airways being open or closed so we have the visceral fat that can affect that we have the fat in the neck and then we have the actual nervous system that affects the structure these nerves are highly influenced by vitamin b1 that called buying mean if a person is deficient in thiamine they can have a massive problem with the autonomic nervous system with the cranial nerves and the phrenic nerve now the other big factor that it can affect these nerves in a negative way is being a diabetic or a pre-diabetic or even having insulin resistance because with those conditions you develop peripheral neuropathy which affects the feet and hands and also nerve dysfunction in general which is called neuropathy and what interesting is that diabetics are usually always deficient in b1 b1 is very protective against the complications of diabetes so ever the complications of having blood sugar problems themself affecting the nervous system and we have vitamin b1 deficiency which is created by a high carb diet and not to mention insulin resistance which is behind obesity one of the things you you have sleep apnea or snoring is you need to lose weight and that absolutely true because if you have less fat in your neck less fat in your abdomen you breathe better but there just losing weight some people that lose weight still snore some people that are thin snore so what do we do number one is get thiamine in your body vitamin b1 vitamin b1 helps the autonomic nervous system that will actually help the tone in the back of the throat vitamin b1 also helps the breathing centers in your brainstem vitamin b1 also helps the phrenic nerve that affects the diaphragm and vitamin b1 also helps to create nerves specifically number nine in 10 so this is probably one of the most important things to do immediately realize that a high carbohydrate diet causes a vitamin b1 deficiency so you gonna have to change your diet and that healthy keto for those of you that are new to my channel I put a link below of exactly how to do this okay and you also want to do intermittent fasting with it because these two in combination can greatly help reverse insulin resistance which is a big part of this problem and also the weight that your neck and in your abdomen the other very important thing to do is take vitamin d3 why because vitamin d3 in amounts of 20,000 i you will greatly assist in getting the deeper delta-wave sleep what happens if you you have sleep apnea is you waking yourself up through the night some people wake up thirty times an hour because the soft tissues in the back of the throat obstruct breathing and they stop breathing and then the nervous system kicks in and wakes them up thirty times an hour so they tired to the day they get enough oxygen to the brain it going to affect the heart there of problems well guess what vitamin d3 helps the deep parts of the brain that regulate the circadian rhythm with sleep it also helps the autonomic nervous system specifically the sympathetic nervous system so this can help in many different ways this can also explain why some people sleep better after a day in the Sun because they get more vitamin D so the combination of b1 through nutritional yeast vitamin d3 now realize you can get this from the Sun but you have to be out in the Sun a certain amount of time I below of how much time or you can take this as a supplement but it difficult to get it just from food so you might just want to take it from the supplement and then don keto and in a minute fasting alright so your next step is to go ahead

Â Dr.Berg on Salt Intake	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl5QTM7mQNY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let people may need more salt number one low adrenals your adrenal glands make hormones that control the amount of salt in your body now if the adrenal glands are low let say you quantity of adrenal hormones as in Addison losing a lot of salt it has a hole in the bucket and the salts going right through and this is very dangerous because if you run out of salt your heart can fluids are not balanced correctly your blood pressure drops too low there these serious side effects that can happen everyone salt but not a salt deficiency then we have blood pressure being too low we mentioned that because the salt actually holds the fluid to maintain the volume of blood in your body so if you don have enough salt there to maintain the blood pressure low back pain would be another symptom of low adrenals and by the way as a side note seventy seven percent of people with Addison deficiencies and one of the top causes worldwide for Addison autoimmune disease as TB and the interesting thing about this microbe is that it has the ability to block the vitamin D receptor and it that certain microbes used to survive because vitamin D gives you the immune system protection against certain microbes especially the epstein-barr virus and even the HIV virus and another symptom of low adrenals should be excessive amounts of calcium the blood which could lead to kidney stones and then we have high potassium anytime we have low salt we have high potassium because salt potassium work together weight loss so a person with Addison they have acidosis on the flip side there Cushing output of adrenal hormones where the person has too much salts the retaining salt they have a low potassium they stressed these guys are stressed - they have belly fat they can can their blood is excessively too alkaline so these are a bit opposite the point is that if you have low adrenals you gonna need more salt okay because your body is not retaining it so that would be indication number one low adrenals need more salt reason number two excessive water intake there people that drink a ton of water like I per day and they or they they consume too much water without the minerals and mainly I salt that could be dangerous to the heartbeat because you minerals and the electrolytes which creates all sorts of problems just look up the condition called hyponatremia which is very dangerous I put a link down below and that comes from consuming too much water or water intoxication you wouldn but - too much of it can be next one sweating excessively if you athlete and let gear like a football player for example head gear shoulder pads the whole thing and it six grams of salt per hour okay and that can be very dangerous so if you do a lot of sweating you need more salt of course I the best sea salt to consume would be Himalayan salt that a mountaintop now you also have Celtic salt and always consume sea salt which has 84 minerals as compared to table salt which only has two all right number four key tell the ketogenic diet can act as a diuretic and push fluid out of your body and also with the fluid comes the minerals and the soul this is why if you electrolytes and you need to consume more salt because you might have some of the symptoms that come along with the keto adaptation if you sodium that would be weakness or weak muscles people that are a high carbohydrate diet just hold a ton of fluid okay so wherever the glucose or sugar goes the water goes so you have a lot of glucose in the body you hold a lot of fluid in the body you basically gonna release a lot of fluid so you of one teaspoon of sea salt per day and this includes doing in a minute fasting just make sure that if you consuming for one or two days and you consuming when level teaspoon dissolve it in some water and then spread it out for the day don once the next point I want to bring up is very very important if you the recommended amount of vegetables that I recommend which is 710 cups you potassium foods if you don enough salt you can have an imbalance with a bit too much potassium so if you must also consume enough salt one teaspoon a day and the other point is my electrolyte powder one scoop is a thousand milligrams of potassium there very little sodium in that electrolyte powder so it the athlete that sweats a lot it for the average person that in potassium so if you electrolyte powder also add the sea salts because eventually you have a bit too much potassium and you may get weak muscles okay all right so there are other reasons why you might need salt but these are the five most common reasons if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
What Are Telomeres & Why They Are Important in Anti-Aging Â Dr.Berg on Telomeres and Aging	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqaR1q2trG8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today the topic is telomeres I gonna try to break this down in real simple terms so you can really get it so telomere would be compared to the end of a shoe string that little plastic protective thing that protects against frank so if we compare the shoe string to a telomere the telomere is the end part of the shoe string it structure at the end of chromosomes you can look at a chromosome as the entire DNA strand okay with everything connected to it so you have the DNA which is the blueprints and basically DNA are sections of genes but the entire collective chain of DNA is the chromosome so telomere is basically a DNA structure at the end of chromosomes that shorten with each division so I gonna give you another analogy let for example I a little scanner and I have to grab onto your arm or your wrist to copy you so I scan your entire body okay it makes a copy of you similar to what in the body you copies of the DNA but the problem is I can wrist in hand is not being copied so I make a copy but the copy is going to be just a little shorter than the actual body because I hand so then I the copy I again and I and over and over every time it divides okay these telomeres are gonna get shorter and shorter and shorter and shorter because part of the copy mechanism has to attach to the telomere now one thing about a telomere is is part of what gonna do a separate video on junk DNA but junk DNA is not non-functional it has a purpose but realize this out of all of your DNA only 5% is responsible for making your tissue to make proteins the rest is considered junk DNA but it does have a purpose the telomere is part of that junk DNA so telomeres basically protect the ends of chromosomes the Greek word for Telos means end and morose means part so it the end part and they found it to your lifespan there genetic to with certain children that are basically born old and they have a body of a seven-year-old and when they tested them they had very short telomeres so over time when your DNA keeps dividing over and over the telomeres shorten and you get less gene expression which basically means you certain genes especially related to repair so when you DNA inside your cells have a huge capacity to keep up with the damage when you telomeres you basically have a hard time keeping up with a repair and that it relates to aging now how do you explain cancer cells that can live forever well they produce an enzyme called telomerase which can counter this shortening effect so a telomerase is an enzyme that allows for the replacement of these short bits of DNA in fact in the 50s there was this lady who had cervical cancer and they extracted this cervical cancer and they started to reproduce these cells okay out of her body over and over and over over a period of decades okay and that cancer was able to reproduce 20 tons of cancer cells I think about it one ton is 2,000 pounds so that happens with cancer cells that keep dividing and they just take over the body now you research coming up in the next 5-10 years on this enzyme now there are some research studies going on right now in humans they bacteria yeast and animals but now they humans and so it should be quite interesting what we do know right now is there is a plant called astragalus that has the ability to boost telomerase and it seems like it has some interesting properties anti-aging properties increasing your immune system decreasing your frequency of eating sick improving your sleep increasing your memory so the studies right now are inconclusive so if you go out and get this product I have no idea if it going to extend your life even by one day now what I in is taking the top reasons why people die heart attacks stroke kidney failure cancer lung disease and then teaching you what you can do to take your weak link and strengthen it because if we can actually eliminate the top reasons why people die you regardless of your telomeres now in a lot of videos that I relate a lot of the reasons why people die to high insulin okay and high carbohydrate diets and this is why if you learn more about it so I put a link down below you need to do healthy keto and in a minute fasting to take that weak link whether it system or your kidney and make it stronger so you actually can extend your life alright thanks for watching if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
How to Fix the Swollen Face (Facial Puffiness) and Puffy Eyes Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sxs7xSg2CaA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	is your face and eyes swollen and puffy or do you know someone who has a swollen face or a puffy eyes this is going to be so easy to fix okay what we with is edema swelling it fluid in the body the fluid is inside the cells and it the interstitial spaces which is the space around the cells now I know about this because I had it you can see this in my earlier videos look at my eyes swollen eyes puffy face now the problem is this extra fluid is not just in the face in the eyes it in the liver it your ankles you could press into the ankle it leaves a little indentation that the lower legs you can see it gives us shiny appearance where the skin is just bulging out okay and then you lose the hair on the bottom of your your lower legs now it could be because you low protein diet when you actually go too low with your protein the fluid inside your blood vessels can leak out into the cells and start creating edema but this is usually not the problem so I there idiopathic okay and pathogenic idiopathic means unknown cause so let say for example someone has acid EEMA and they don don shows up normal but they still have edema and then you have pathogenic this is the person with cirrhosis and their liver is literally leaking fluid into a sac around the gut that it peritoneum you look on the outside they look skinny but they have a lot of retention of fluid in the gut they may have pitting edema and eat lower ankles that diabetic that has this huge swollen feet and their ankles are filled with fluid sometimes the hand is so filled with fluid they can they can would be pathogenic because the kidney in the heart and liver are a problem to the heart if you have congestive heart failure the fluid backs up into the tissues as well and of course the treatment that is given is diuretics okay avoiding salt and compression stockings so let me show you what on behind this condition it is the high carbohydrate diet that guessed it the average American consumes between 250 to 400 grams of carbohydrates and I vegetable carbohydrates I about refined grains and sugar each gram of carbohydrate holds three grams of water so this carbohydrate is acting as a sponge in your muscles and your liver around the tissue so you far as myself what I was consuming is fruit primarily apples okay I used to consume a lot of apples with peanut butter I would take the Honey Crisp apples which is basically 19 grams of sugar and I would cut it and I would have that peanut butter I would have a snack mid-morning mid-afternoon and after dinner so that I was eating good otherwise but I was doing three meals and three snacks so if you the problem with that many meals you raising a lot of insulin and I was getting a lot of sugar so I was 211 pounds so right now I am 180 a lot of that was fluent okay and you can see it in my eyes and as soon as I cut up those apples the fluid came right off very quickly and of course I only consumed two meals a day right now first meal right around I don 3 and the next meal maybe five or six what happens in addition to this fluid retention is you also create a lot of inflammation and with inflammation you next thing is that these this high carbohydrate diet retains a tremendous amount of salt so you you problem with high carbohydrate diets is you deplete your potassium reserves so the more carbohydrate you consume in the form of refined carbs and sugar you depleting your potassium potassium helps to get rid of the fluid so we have higher amounts of sodium and low amounts of potassium and we have an imbalance an average person needs about 4700 milligrams of potassium now if we look at all the nutrients in the RDAs potassium is at the top of the list as far as the quantity of that specific nutrient we just need a lot of it okay like magnesium is like 450 milligrams vitamin C is like 70 milligrams but we needed just a ton of potassium now there historically that we were consuming 11000 milligrams of potassium and of course to get your body at those levels you these things called vegetables okay big salads I pretty much do all of my vegetables most of my vegetables in one meal it first meal I do consume fermented vegetables okay so that does add to it but not in large quantities you do get potassium from eggs and meats but not as much as the greens so let me just explain how simple it is to get rid of that puffiness in the eyes and the swollen face all you have to do is bring your carbs down bring them down below 50 grams or less okay preferably 20 grams you excess fluid pretty quick but in addition to that also increase your potassium foods large amounts of vegetables these two simple things right here will get rid of the swollen eyes and the puffy face really fast thanks for watching if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
Common Nutrient Deficiencies Caused by Drugs that You Should Know Â Dr.Berg on Nutrient Depletion	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnJB2dGk8d0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I want to talk about the micronutrient deficiencies that are created when you actually take a drug this is one of those things that no one not telling you about this it listening to label but it that as you create these nutritional deficiencies you create symptoms that then are treated with a drug so it gets really confusing you don causing what okay so in the assets when you take any assets there like an h2 antagonist it creates an iron deficiency b12 vitamin D deficiency calcium deficiency zinc deficiency and the folic acid deficiency a lot of these nutrients function to help repair DNA so that and then we have proton pump inhibitors you get a magnesium deficiency and a b12 deficiency if this goes on too long that can create all sorts of severe neurological problems and the acids in general like Rolaids for example that use calcium neutralize the stomach and now you mineral deficiencies could be zinc it could be calcium potassium magnesium all the minerals they just can absorbed also b12 and protein antibiotics not just destroy your good bacteria but it creates a deficiency in calcium magnesium iron k1 because the microbes actually make k1 be one two three five six nine that and b12 and a depressive medication you become deficient in Co Q 10 which is really important in repairing the heart magnesium which is a cofactor in about 600 different enzymes b2 b6 b9 and b12 antipsychotic drugs create a b2 deficiency and in vitamin C deficiency not to mention there more - I just put the main and a hypertensive drugs that reduce blood pressure so if ACE inhibitors which deplete zinc magnesium and potassium which by the way when you take potassium and magnesium it helps you lower blood pressure okay beta blockers coenzyme q10 depletion vitamin D deficiency calcium channel blocker so it to block calcium but folic acid and the B complex then we have anti cholesterol medication of mainly talking about statins this is a big one it create two deficiencies with vitamin A D e K Co Q 10 EPA DHA these are the omega-3 fatty acids that make up the brain structure and it involved with the brain function because with statins they production of cholesterol so you gonna have a problem with making cell membranes hormones testosterone many things okay cortical steroids you have a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and b1 by the way then we have metformin which is for type 2 diabetes it creates a deficiency in B 12 B 1 and B 9 and the other problem with metformin is that it has a black label that it can produce lactic acidosis and guess what the remedy for that is b1 but if you don can create a problem diuretics it big one because diuretics are used to get rid of fluid and they people that have high blood pressure so it starts to block magnesium potassium zinc and if you take the diuretics that our potassium sparrows in other ones they don a buildup of calcium so it throws off your electrolytes it see if you did take electrolytes if you had flute retention that because potassium and magnesium help to eliminate excess sodium and they help balance your fluids but they don really look at that okay hormone replacement therapy depletes B nine which is folic acid magnesium b6 and b12 and this is just the tip of the iceberg we other side effects anyway if you taking in these medications you better be taking these nutrients thanks for watching if you please subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
Use Manganese Trace Mineral for Excessive Blinking, Jerking, Twitching and other Tics Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y6LeqOzw5Y	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we mineral that can greatly help someone if they have a condition of excessive blinking jerking twitching and other tic like motions there like Tourette syndrome or tardive dyskinesia or dystonia involving involuntary repetitive body motions could be anything grimacing sticking your tongue out smacking your lips and the list goes on and on and on now there involved in suppressing these abnormal muscle movements is called extra pyramidal and sometimes not always people develop certain involuntary movements as a side effect from taking certain site drugs or tranquilizers for a period of time now it could also occur from having some type of damage to this part of the brain now it just so happens that this part of the brain needs a lot of manganese not magnesium but manganese to function and there research on taking this very inexpensive trace mineral ten milligrams three times a day in improving these symptoms and sometimes it something that manganese or other nutrients and not consuming the foods high in a certain nutrient manganese is in spinach it almonds it spinach and almonds are high in oxalates and oxalates block the absorption of manganese so if you of these you get enough manganese also bran in grains which we don manganese but this has something called phytic acid which blocks manganese which is a trace mineral so if you expressing your symptoms I really don believe that you enough manganese from your diet you gonna have to take it as a supplement ten milligrams three times a day if you magnesium because magnesium is also involved in a lot of other coenzymes as a helper molecule involved in the biochemical processes also add vitamin b3 that but let that can occur if you manganese all right blood sugar problems you can be you can have insulin resistance pre-diabetes or even diabetes you can have a problem in mineralizing your bones and you can end up with osteoporosis or osteopenia you can have impaired growth so if your mother was deficient in manganese when she was pregnant with you you may not reach your full growth also you may have skeletal structural abnormalities you can have skin rashes low manganese can increase your risk for epilepsy having more pain and inflammation muscle spasm and having excessive amounts of ammonia because manganese is involved in something called the urea cycle which is involved with breaking protein down and making sure that this is detoxified so you don you know of someone who has this definitely get them to try manganese to see if it can actually help thanks for watching if you please subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
What Do Nail Polish Remover and Fat Burning Have In Common? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqNWKFtKoAM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so what dudes nail polish remover and fat burning have in common well let talk about that there are three types of ketones ketones are created out of the fat burning process they there you have beta-hydroxybutyrate you have acetoacetate and you have acetone this is the one that is the nail polish remover of course when your body is making it it purchase it and use it as nail polish remover it was reading some comments on one of my youtube videos and someone asked the question if I consume nail polish remover would that be the same as going into ketosis and no it the same that is very very toxic and this is very very safe okay so no don consume your nail polish remover what happens when you start ketosis is that you start to generate more and more ketones and when you it lot of fat fuel which is a good thing because you want to lose fat so when you initially get into ketosis you are actually peeing out ketones and you breathing out ketones and that this is all about right here so you actually breathing out and peeing out actual fat particles how cool is that if you have this nail polish breath or a fruity breath realize it transitional it will go away as you do this more and more and more and as your body becomes more more efficient it gonna burn up these ketones a hundred percent so there will be absolutely no nail polish breath or fruity breath anymore but realize if you do have this occur you are in ketosis and the benefits of ketosis are huge weight loss decrease inflammation decrease hunger stabilizing your blood sugars now if you wanted to speed up the process all you have to do is drop your carbs lower and fast longer and you faster and more completely to a full 100 percent ketones date alright thanks for watching hey if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success

The Black Bubonic Plague Â Interesting New Findings Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPQx7xe6CgQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	alright guys so today I about something probably on your mind the Black Plague there names for the Black Plague you have Black Death the great plague or bubonic plague they there findings that relate to nutrition that I want to bring up now the black plague or Black Death was the second pandemic event that occurred in the year thirteen forty through the 1400s now if you look in the history books this event was caused by a bacteria infecting fleas which then was spread by rats okay throughout Europe and even Asia however recently there was 25 skeletons which were victims four of the black plague in a London cemetery here they found the bones of all 25 victims showed signs of rickets what is rickets that is a severe vitamin D deficiency now what between vitamin D and the black plague or an infection well vitamin D is not really a vitamin it powerful immune modulators it regulates the immune system and if you deficient it susceptible to infections bacterial infections viral infections systemic infections septicemia and autoimmune diseases in fact you will nearly always find a vitamin D deficiency in someone with an autoimmune condition alright so number one they found a vitamin D deficiency also the bone showed other signs of malnutrition and signs of injuries now what this is it relates to another video I did about this Spanish flu which occurred in 1918 and if you haven that video I put a link down below and the reason why that there were 50 million people who died in the Spanish flu and there was about 50 million people that died in this black plague okay because it was a pandemic event and my question is how could just a virus spread through the entire world and just kill that many people it just doesn make sense what came just before the event what came right before the Spanish flu and what came before the Black Plague so with the Spanish flu you had this world war one which occurred just before the event which you had huge shifts in the transport of food you have the canning of food which led to nutritional deficiencies when you can food you decrease the zinc by 85% and with the Spanish flu it peaked in January which is the time of year where you have the lowest amount of vitamin D exposure from the Sun of the entire year which is interesting so what happened with the Spanish flu is we have this malnutrition vitamin D deficiency a war situation and then you get this infection well with the black plague signs of injury well that sounds like a war to me now why would they have low vitamin D and malnutrition now there some other interesting points in 1315 there was an eruption of a volcano okay Mount Tarawera and the ashes from this event may have fected the temperature around the globe you can look this up and precipitated the Great Famine of 1315 just 13 17 other references say it but there was a famine interesting so now we have malnutrition and if you having ashes that could potentially affect the temperature you low vitamin D levels because it to act as a barrier most of Europe was affected this famine apparently was caused by bad weather probably from this event and then you had crop failure so you have all these things that are just stacking up to set people up for a very low immune system now what is that some people think that the bubonic plague was way in the past it doesn it does happen very rarely but it still could happen in fact seven people in the US every single year get the bubonic plague now one more interesting point about this that may relate to this or the topic we California brown shrimp were fed a diet without vitamin C and within six weeks they develop black lesions now with the black death or black plague or bubonic plague what happens you necrosis of the tissue very similar to gangrene and the tissue is turning black that well apparently when you start shrimping and see they develop black lesions and they call it the Black Death disease and the bacterial counts go way up and they get septicemia which is a severe infection now the reason why I wanted to bring up this whole point is to show you the relationship between severe infections and vitamin deficiencies especially vitamin D especially during the winter months to protect yourself against viruses you really want to make sure you get enough vitamin D now it very difficult to get it from food if not impossible and it difficult to get it during the winter months so you it in a supplement form and lastly just to summarize the main point the Black Plague and the Spanish flu are perfect examples of how a nutritional deficiency could potentially set you up for a serious infection all right thanks for watching if you please subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success

How to Determine Your Recovery Level Â Speed Up Recovery Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfGKiGhZg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I you can determine your recovery rate now there you can do if you determine your recovery there did a video on that you can check it out below there variability which measures the sympathetic and parasympathetic part of the nervous system which is the autonomic nervous system it did that test in my office for many many years it how much sympathetic or flutter fight that your body is stuck in versus how much parasympathetic or recovery you have left and a lot of times you would see people like normally the sympathetic should be right here so you would normally see it like way up here people stuck in that flight or flight mode yet the recovery that should be way over here is like way over here so they had very low recovery with high amount of stress so if you don test like this you can go by other factors so I want to differentiate two things you have your body recovery rate and then you have the beings recovery rate so let example you have this really tough guy he 18 but physically he little bit older okay and in his mind he out there and does this intense exercise and ends up almost having a heart attack so you do have the person themself and their attitude towards stress in life and then you have the body which is basically two different things body recovery has to do with your ability to repair and there are repair proteins or enzymes in your body that do the work of repairing damage at the DNA level and your body is constantly repairing those breaks in DNA and the damage that occurs to different parts of the machinery in your cells and they definitely require nutrients like zinc folic acid vitamin C vitamin E and these repair proteins you definitely require nutrients or they don the body tends to relegate or ration out certain nutrients if it nutrient it will ration out that nutrient to just the most important functions and it can neglect the longevity proteins and some of these repair proteins and then you have your adrenals your adrenal glands deal with stress they help you adapt to stress and if you have a lot of stress in your life it accumulates and it builds up and the less adrenals will function and there a lot of things you can do to improve it this video is not about that but I put a link down below of some things that you can do one of the most important thing is to get your sleep corrected and by the way a lot of people that think they really getting enough sleep stay tuned for a video in that I that very soon but the question is how do you adapt to stress okay one good way is through the heart rate and there link down below you can check it out you can do this test you just exercise for one minute and I go through exactly how to evaluate that this is really important if you are into exercise also let a good workout and you can that night that is an indication that you stress tolerance is low or let your blood pressure goes way too high for many hours after you workout and it doesn rebound so you have the heart rate and blood pressure or even your mood or a stress reaction how long does it take for you to bounce back from stress mentally that if your adrenals are weak it hard to bounce back from stress quickly but I want to show you a couple things that you can do to strengthen your ability to repair and even the the genes and the proteins that help you repair okay it a term to describe beneficial stress now they found that stress free bacteria do not thrive well they don we take a person and put them in a completely stress-free environment and they never have to do anything they don amount of stress our bodies become stronger I mean even take a look at some of the real successful people they been through incredibly hard times and they bounce back from it and it became stronger of course if the stress didn kill you first I think there about that but hormesis would involve many things one would be in a minute fasting so when you do intermittent fasting you starvation which is a stress and your body rebounds by turning on certain genes that become stronger you actually get younger when you starve but not too much just kind of a moderate amount of starvation fascinating exercise the same thing when you exercise in the correct quantity and the correct intensity with the correct recovery you can become much more fit and stronger cold therapy it called cryotherapy can actually stimulate certain proteins that become stronger heat therapy like a sauna or infrared sauna therapy very powerful oxygen therapy hyperbaric oxygen therapy I you spiking oxygen and then bringing it down and you simulating deep-sea diving so it an interesting effect on stimulating stem cells and your bone and stimulating stem cells in your brain you have there therapy UV light just going out the Sun a small amount of radiation can be very beneficial because your body can rebound and become stronger even final nutrients which are considered toxins in plants can actually help build up our own body I have a question for you on a scale from one to ten ten being very high recovery where do you think you are zero being no recovery give me a number down B below in the comments section if you liking this content please subscribe now and I will actually keep you

Why You Can Not Kill a Virus	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EADzWlbSdVM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so here today why can well it in the first place they mysterious wrapped in a sack and they invade our body they go into our cells and they latch on to the machinery of our cells usually the DNA and they start to use our own body replicate so you really can virus because it doesn life force but you can definitely acquire a virus get sick and then once your body deals with that virus it doesn because it remission it goes in a dormant stage and that what I want to talk about so many of you watching probably had a virus infection in the past that virus is still in your body it might come out as herpes like in a canker sore in your mouth or a cold sore in your mouth type one herpes is in the mouth of the tongue type twos and the genitals and it really tends to hang out and the nerves so here you have this infection your immune system deals with it it goes into remission and it cyst there and it waits and it waits and it waits until you stressed out and you sick and you and then it comes out and gets reactivated you have epstein-barr virus a lot of people have that as a teenager that can be reactivated later in life from stress and you may not necessarily even pull on the full infection it could just make you chronically fatigued because you event what not chemotherapy can activate epstein-barr virus radiation can activate epstein-barr virus then you have human papilloma virus 90% of the population has this virus in their body and that can be reactivated through stress and when I talk about stress it could be mental stress it can be a loss it could be physical stress then you have another virus called the cytomegalovirus which can be reactivated if it inflammation this is why if you have colitis or inflammation of your colon that can reactivate this virus now the problem with this virus it can lead to cervical cancer chicken pox virus can be reactivated and as herpes zoster or shingles so you can see a lot of viruses just sitting there as a potential problem but you be fine as long as you don stress anymore or nutritional deficiencies then you to go I just want to talk about three really important nutrients that help suppress viruses these are the three nutrients that are probably the most antiviral of any of the nutrients out there and vitamin D is the top of the list now the microbes in TB which is a bacteria and this is a virus epstein-barr virus and the HIV virus what they do they have a strategy they decrease the receptor for your vitamin D called the vitamin D receptor in other words if this is the receptor right here for vitamin D they will somehow block this so you don you then these things will survive this is kind of a survival mechanism by these pathogens right here so if you have these infections okay it important to have enough vitamin D and I some links down below it difficult to get vitamin D from the diet and it from the Sun if it it enough also vitamin D decreases the risk of cervical cancer okay I talked about that right here and the reason for that is that vitamin D helps suppress the virus that can trigger the cancer you go back here vitamin D can also decrease the risk of influenza the flu virus okay and also respiratory infections it can help protect you in almost bulletproof yourself against respiratory infections zinc is the next most important mineral to talk about in relationship to viruses because it can decrease the frequency of that virus getting reactivated the duration of the time that it is in activation and it can also decrease the severity of the symptoms especially with herpes and shingles which is along the nerve roots and if you have shingles it oxide topically you can put it right of lesions and really decrease the pain and the third one is selenium very very important if you get a lot more viral reactivation than if you had enough alright thanks for watching if you please subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
The REAL Causes of Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfwjORgy6ZM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hi guys Dr bur here in this short video we fatty liver disease so many people have a fatty liver and it doesn it much alcohol there that the main reason is insulin resistance and I want to explain that if you haven put some links down below but this is very important see insulin is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugars a lot of people associate with diabetes but insulin is the hormone that if even in a small amount it converts food especially carbohydrates to cholesterol and fat and it really loads up that liver with fat so in the presence of a little too much insulin you liver and it may not even show up as a weight problem at first but it will probably show up in the midsection as far as a fatty gut in fact and this is just my opinion I think um because I tested it so many times I to the radi radiologist to get ultr sounds in their liver if you take someone with a gut they have a fatty liver and a lot of times when the liver fills up with fat it spills over into the gut and you have this roll around the top section or you have this protruded belly which um is a whole other thing but here problem with this fatty liver is that you don long time the liver has to be almost completely destroyed like 90% before even shows up on a blood test so you you don doesn in life so when you just bringing your awareness up because what is turning into therosis that scar tissue the liver is becoming like fibrotic and so it function over time and it might show up in arthritis and joint problems and fatigue but it might not at first but the point is that you need just to be aware of this is a serious problem down the road so you got theosis this U liver role and what um releasing insulin an insulin resistance is when the insulin is no longer being accepted like it should in the liver so the liver is blocking it it back to the pancreas and says hey it being blocked it hear you so then the pancreas starts producing more insulin because the return messages the feedback is not connecting so it to your your child telling him to take out the garbage they you start shouting at them and so that what this five to seven times more insulin pumped out by the pancreas than normal people and what that problem with the liver it start getting fattier and fattier and fattier um I remember there was in my patient this one guy came in he had um 95% of his liver was was completely filled with fat and I remember his looking at his abdomen it was all distended and sticking out and he was doing ice cream every single night so I know you know people who do that but if you been watching my videos your diet is probably absolutely perfect right now but here this first of all you have to know the liver is the one of the only organs that can take a real big beating and regenerate 100 % liver tissue can come back that good news the bad news is it takes a bit of time it could take up to three years of eating healthy to restore your liver you can one of the best remedies that dissolves fat is choline and you can buy this from the heha store choline and it considered a type of B vitamin but it really lipotropic which helps dissolve fat in the liver and probably whatever it dosage start taking that on a regular basis but again I don want you to get the impression that it just taking a pill to fix your liver you have to fix your whole lifestyle you have to fix your eating you have to take a whole body approach because it going to work just to take a pill and not change your ways cruciferous vegetables are the other thing that you need to start consuming because that will also help fat off the liver if you don it you can do something like this this is the organic cruciferous concentrate and you take this you would probably take 9 to 12 of these a day if you have a fatty liver to help support the liver to help clean it up so that thing you can do to enhance your diet but you but you cannot fix this without actually eating tremendous amounts of vegetables if you don you them somehow maybe in a shake or something but it fix fix this condition if you don consume vegetables these other things are just enhancements they Cure and then the other thing is you don the sugar activates the insulin okay so we want to avoid the sugar the hidden sugars add more vegetables cine is a really good one cruciferous is another one um and again it doing these there you have individual specific problems if you really are serious about getting healthy you maybe want to consider signing up for my membership site and in that site you have me to guide you it is do-it-yourself but you can always ask me a personal questions it most coste effective way to get help because I have over 200 lessons that you would learn from and I put a link down below so you can check it out and you got a month to test it out to see if you like it or you

this is a really good thing to to take the holistic approach and to give you the knowledge So you you conditions just because you don some you i you understand it so go ahead and apply some of these uh tips right here and I hope this uh educate a little bit and so your next step is to get started	Success
A Surprising Way To Cleanse Fatty Liver Â Dr. Berg On Liver Detoxification	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weZ_BoMptLI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys today we a very unconventional uncommon contour intuitive fatty liver cleansing tip okay before I get into the tip I just want to give you some basics about the liver the liver is about three and a half pounds it sits over on the right side right about here it has 500 different functions here someone develops a fatty liver there is virtually no symptoms at all now you start to develop a gut but it rare to have symptoms until it starts becoming more advanced and then eventually the person starts getting fatigued weak nausea abdominal pain right shoulder pain pain in the upper right trap maybe some headaches on the right side pain in the right rhomboid back here but what happens is you have this fatty liver and then eventually after years of inflammation you get cirrhosis and this is scar tissue now builds up in the liver and in this process you basically lose function of the liver you lose the ability to detoxify okay so you build up toxic waste you also build up excessive amounts of cortisol because the liver is the organ to help buffer and regulate excessive amounts of cortisol that stress hormone this is one of the causes to a an adrenal fatigue problem also you start building up excessive amounts of estrogen this can manifest as many different things one man boobs a woman that cancer so a functional liver is really important in the detoxification and regulation of these two hormones right here the other problem is when you have less function of the liver you get less bile production and if you producing a bile you can can absorb vitamin A D e K omega-3 fatty acids and the list goes on and on and on now there a fatty liver one would be caused from drinking too much alcohol the other one is not the other one is a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease you can develop that from eating very poorly and the big thing that causes a fatty liver would be fructose in the form of high-fructose corn syrup it fact fructose is 20 times more likely to cause of fatty liver than any other sugars and as far as the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 25 percent of the population actually has this but not just overweight people not just people with a gut skinny people are twice as likely to die from a fatty liver then overweight people probably because they healthy and they can eat whatever they want so they do eat whatever they want now this next point was quite interesting there studies on this but here when mice are fed methionine and choline deficient diets they get a fatty liver but they don get insulin resistance or diabetes they just get a fatty liver the thine eyne is an amino acid in choline is an essential nutrient in the B vitamin family and the thine eyne is a precursor a building block to the most powerful antioxidant in the body which is called glutathione which is a software-based compound that helps you break down chemicals and choline is a called a lipid trophic nutrient it actually dissolves fat in the body and it can actually strip off fat from your liver so now let into the counterintuitive tip I to talk about typically when you think about liver cleansing or getting rid of a liver problem you juicing a vegetable cleanse consuming low fats consuming lower amounts meats things like that however when you do that you only get a certain amount of results because check this out the foods that are loaded with choline are egg yolks liver grass-fed dairy and cruciferous vegetable okay math I chicken pork nuts fish eggs so two of the most important nutrients in correcting or reversing a fatty liver involve foods higher in fat and protein so if you want to cleanse and heal a fetid liver you don to keep your protein too low moderate protein not excessive but you don to start cutting out all these foods right here so instead of doing juicing or only vegetables you should do a combination of the cruciferous vegetables and fattier proteins including egg yolks and fish of course make sure they two goals with detoxifying a fatty liver one is to get rid of the toxins of course because the liver has a function of detoxification so the cruciferous vegetables are loaded with the phytonutrients to help create this effect and by the way certain animal products organ meats fish seafood also have antioxidants to help remove toxins from your liver it so we want to actually do something to get rid of the toxins as well as get rid of the fat and to do this you must lower your carbs and this is why healthy keto the healthy version of keto is necessary and that basically means the concept of low carb with a lot of vegetables so that would be essential and then of course in a minute fasting why because of intermittent fasting forces your body to use up your glycogen Reserve and to run off fat so it kind of creates a vacuum to pull the fat out of the body and that deplete the fat in the liver I also suggest that you take choline as a supplement you can get methionine from the protein and you can also get choline but if you take some extra choline I recommend about 4 to 500 milligrams you can even go as high as 3,000 milligrams if you want but typically I always start out about 300 to 400 milligrams of choline you can get in a tablet or get into powder and start consuming that what that will do it will start to dissolve the fat and the liver and speed up the process so of course we want to add the crisps I would recommend steaming or slightly cooking these because that will release more vital nutrients eggs are essential for the choline quality protein of course don the health of store and increase the quality and the last point I want to bring up which is really important is if you try to cleanse the liver especially if it diet you will not have enough bile to help detoxify it one of the functions of bio is detoxification so bile is not just about absorbing fats on the vitamins it is about making sure the liver can purge some of the toxic wastes and what triggers bile higher amounts of saturated fats this is why you want to keep consuming egg yolks maybe even organ meats and moderate amounts of protein to make sure you release the bile and you don methionine or choline alright guys well thank you

How Much of Your Disease and Health is Genetic?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsM9pl5SX1M	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so the question is how much of your disease is genetic and how much of your health is genetic sometimes people might tell you you know it I was just born with bad genes and there pick your parents more wisely next time that is absolutely not true only five to ten percent of disease is caused by some genetic defect that is passed on from your parents it doesn going to get that disease there really good book but I as a metabolic disease by Thomas C free this guy is like the expert in cancer and what he says and I paraphrasing when you see tumors and cancers you do see a lot of genetic mutations but those mutations those alterations and genes are downstream in other words their symptoms they causes of the cancer they the damage in the mitochondria the machinery where you that and then the mitochondria adapts to a different metabolism called fermentation and because the mitochondria has its own DNA and they DNA in the nucleus okay because they outside the nucleus they susceptible to mutations and alterations in the DNA and that the reasons why you see so many gene mutations in tumors and cancer because of this fact so most of the gene mutations are not inherited they what define somatic mutations basically means not inherited that caused by your environment let here epigenetics that means above genetics so if DNA is DVDs the DVD player would be the epigenetics so you can select what song or what playlist that you want to activate okay so epi genetics is all about controlling your genes and activating your genes because your genes don they be activated or what is called silenced or not activated but here ninety to ninety five percent of your health and whether you get a disease is epigenetics now I more word okay and then that the words exposome okay this is a word that means the accumulation of all the exposures of an individual in a lifetime and how those exposures relate to health and we of exposure to your environment and this starts before you were born when you ate the stress that she experienced all that adds up that can eventually trigger certain genes that lead to certain diseases so epigenetics we include all the environmental factors the stresses the social experiences as a child and especially the nutrition and what you eat and what you don you makes you very very susceptible to getting all sorts of diseases so the nutrition is a really important factor in protecting you against DNA damage and supporting also the repair of DNA so it can prevent the mutations and alterations that then lead to disease and I really believe that another huge factor that environment with epigenetics is your attitude and your mental state how you view things how you deal with life are you in fear all the time and worried about things versus I do you have a relaxed mental attitude about it I think that main message for this video is this your genes have a lot less to do with your health and you have the ability to control your genes way more than you think so don concept that everything is genetic and you that true because you can control your health because your lifestyle and your attitude are a senior factor in this I put another video down below to give you additional information about epigenetics thanks for watching hey if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
The 7 Reasons for a Chronic Cough	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEYEngrauCo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let chronic cough okay number one a b12 deficiency now this is not as common but if you affect the neurology throughout the body but it could also affect the nerves to your vocal cords and create an irritation so realize that a simple way to get b12 is by consuming red meat and/or liver that alright next one is something called the laryngeal fern Geel reflex okay that is a situation where you that valve and your stomach should be closed kind of comes up there and it irritate all the way up through the book into the vocal cords now that could come from a vitamin D deficiency number one or just low hydrochloric acid in your stomach and both of these are very common if your vitamin D deficient and just realize that vitamin D does influence gastrin which helps you release hydrochloric acid this can create this effect where the valve just doesn stereo tation and even the enzymes can even break down the protein and your esophagus and even your vocal cords so that can be more severe now if you low in hydrochloric acid in the stomach and you let be one to three is four five or six you just don stomach that could be enough to prevent the valve on the top of the stomach from closing and that acid come right up and irritate your throat as well as the enzymes this could come from many things it could come from just getting older and you just need to supply more factors like betaine how to chloride or outside a vinegar to make it more acidic if you come from eating too much junk food taking any acids you salts which is necessary to build hydrochloric acid so there things and I learn more about this but if you in HCl or low in vitamin D you can create this condition next thing is if you have an allergy and a lot of times in the spring of the fall the mold or the pollen can irritate the throat or the sinuses cause a post nasal drip and create this cough now if it all year round it could be mold in your house for example that could be causing this one interesting thing about allergies is that if you acidify the stomach and you add more let chloride or upset a vinegar to make this more acidic it can improve the allergy so it enlarged thyroid if your thyroid is enlarging or you have a goiter that can put pressure on your vocal cords and create a coughing sensation sometimes when you look at people you can actually even see that they have this swollen area right around your thyroid they don so they should go get it checked and I have videos on that as well next thing is a viral infection it could be a virus that you had way in the past that is reactivated because viruses go dormant that reactivated under stress or when you deficient in certain things like vitamin D or zinc and that can actually come out as a viral infection in your throat or in the upper respiratory area two very good things to take for viruses and prevent them from coming out of remission would be zinc and you got a vitamin D and number seven is probably the most common reason for a chronic cough it the way you can become calcium deficient if you don acid because it takes a very acidic stomach to absorb minerals especially calcium so if you calcium it can create a little bit of a spasm in your vocal chords and that can create a chronic cough I always recommend something called calcium lactate for for people under chronic cough if you don other condition I recommend the calcium lactate and it seems to resolve it pretty quick so there you have it the seven reasons for a chronic cough if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
The Danger of Excess Phosphorus	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDkGEO0anBI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now I nutrient deficiencies this video is going to be on the dangers of excess phosphorus it become deficient in phosphorus because it phosphorus for many reasons all of our cells needed your ATP adenosine triphosphate the energy currency of the body has a component of phosphorus you need phosphorus or energy for your bones for your DNA it different things but if you have too much it can really mess with your kidneys when you have end-stage kidney disease too much phosphorus can be very very very deadly but here even if the kidney is 20% damaged it doesn phosphorus can be very damaging to the kidney so anyone with any type of kidney damage should be careful about too much phosphorus excess phosphorus can really damage the heart it can make the ventricles enlarged it can also lead to calcium deposits in your arteries because that excess phosphorus will dissolve the bone and leach it out and it can end up in your arteries so you have osteoporosis or osteopenia you get fractures and then all that calcium plugs up your arteries not a good situation so take a well guess where most people would get excess amounts of phosphorus hint-hint soda especially the dark-colored soda it to 500 milligrams per soda why do they put it in there well because it gives a tangy flavor it decreases mold and bacteria and it actually gives you a little spike in energy but phosphorus is also in other foods too you should start reading the labels it foods it so when you read the labels and it says foss it sodium phosphate is more phosphorus so I just wanted to do this video to make you aware that excess amounts of certain nutrients can be just as bad as deficiencies hey if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
Why Do You Get Acne During Your Period (Menstruation)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9gG1ePfRFQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	recently I had a question in my live show why acne during my period every other month the ovaries take turn an ovulation so this month it might be at the left ovary next month it might be the right ovary and that correlates sometimes with acne that develops on the jawline and one side one month the next month it is actually quite interesting but let talk about what actually causes the acne during menstruation when you your period if we look at the entire month we have several things happening at day 14 when you the high spike of estrogen about a week later you get the high spike with progesterone but during menstruation you have the lowest amount of estrogen and the lowest amount of progesterone so the question is why are you getting acne if these two are alone well there hormone involved and that is called testosterone now testosterone is a type of androgen and that is a male hormone but even women have a certain amount of it but if there female body you start getting facial hair acne hair loss deeper voice things like that now the ovaries produce several types of androgens which can then turn into testosterone or DHT okay also your adrenal glands also make androgens which can also turn into testosterone but the majority or the lion so what getting too much testosterone for the amount of estrogen and progesterone that ratio that just shows too much testosterone and testosterone and DHT enlarges the sebaceous gland or the sweat gland and that can then release more sebum or more oil and there can be bacteria involved and then that results in acne so acne just occurs if there too much antigen you see this in puberty you see this in another condition called polycystic ovarian syndrome in that case you have much insulin that androgen in this case it different because it words it doesn it happens during this period of time so we know there there progesterone and just too much testosterone now the big question is what do you do about this there really really good remedy that can help you and it concentrated cruciferous product the there cruciferous vegetables and dim is like consuming two pounds of these vegetables in one pill so it is an androgen antagonist so it helps lower and urgent and it helps with acne and helps with cystic acne on your back so it can be very helpful now dim is also helpful in balancing estrogen so it acts as a phytoestrogen that can increase estrogen and it also can eliminate excessive amounts of estrogen too now it does not give you more estrogen that you already have it helps to balance the ratios of good versus bad estrogen so it beneficial for women that are fighting breast cancer and sometimes they concerned about it being a phytoestrogen that can increase more estrogen but it really helps the ratio so it helps to balance both estrogen and androgen now there involved that you might want to look at one is cortisol because cortisol is a hormone produced by the adrenals and a lot of times when people go through stress that can generate more adrenal hormones and more testosterone so you want to monitor your stress level and then of course we have insulin if you were to help to normalize your insulin levels that would also help to normalize testosterone as well and that with keto intamin fasting if you to my channel I put a link down below you definitely want to check that out because that can help not just with your skin but with weight and many many other conditions anyway that acne and this is the recommendation thanks for watching hey if you haven press the button below and I will keep you in the know hey that runs	Success
Why is Lemon Juice Good for Gout Arthritis and Bad for Osteoarthritis? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44Ak4mtPs18	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I wanted to create a short video on why lemon juice can be both good and bad for our itis now that so let me explain what I if we compare gout arthritis with osteoarthritis there things happening with gout arthritis you have high levels of uric acid now the osteoarthritis you don you have calcium deposits within the joints and you have a breakdown of the joints and you have inflammation so gout symptoms get better when you make things more alkaline okay when you alkalize the body a little bit more with osteoarthritis you typically get worse when you make things more alkaline and that relationship between calcium and pH if your stomach for example is too alkaline you will not be able to absorb calcium so when you al collides the body you can actually create a flare-up with arthritis and as a side note you can also create a worsening of allergies by the way so in osteoarthritis you want to acidify the body a little bit more and that vinegar when you consume lemon or lemon juice and it gets broken down metabolized it actually turns alkalyn it turns into a base and that worsens gout because it makes things more alkaline so citric acid whether it limes grapefruit oranges when it metabolize it turns alkaline and it can make out worse so to lessen the pain in the attack and the precipitation of this uric acid all you have to do and this is a temporary thing is alkalis the urine now in Austria thread us if you alkalize the body you because of the connection between pH and calcium for example it takes a very acidic stomach to absorb calcium and if the body is a little bit too alkaline calcium tends to precipitate out and get stuck in the joints so with cases of osteoarthritis they do better with apple cider vinegar to acidify the body but with gout they will do worse without cider vinegar now let so when you consume lemon juice for gout the person usually feels a lot better because you lower the acidity but for osteoarthritis you make it worse because you make things more alkaline so for osteoarthritis use apple cider vinegar for gout use lemon juice and by the way that that little bit you want to correct the underlying cause of course high fructose corn syrup is at the top the list with causing gout people that are sensitive purines and I put a complete video on gout below you should check it out if you have this because the true cause of gout is a sluggish kidney and you want to keep working on your kidney now as a side note when you do in a minute fasting your body will produce more uric acid as an antioxidant and if you sensitive to it it could give you a flare-up of gout and this is why you could either do lemon juice or you can do potassium citrate to alkalize the body to chill out this acidity and turn off that gout symptom alright thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video hey if you haven subscribed press the button below and I will keep you in the know hey that runs	Success
The 7 Benefits of a Cold Shower	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTVMGyJ8cZU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we benefits of taking a cold shower this is really about something called cryotherapy cold therapy now with cryotherapy you chamber for just a very small amount of time because it two maybe three maybe up to five minutes and this concept is really based on this word hormesis okay hora mucins what is that that is a situation where you adding a low dose dress or a moderate amount of stress to create a beneficial effect there create this effect this is called hormetic effect but it survival mechanism that for eons I mean if you think about in the past with human bodies the combination of how many times that our bodies have starved and been in the cold so you the body will do over time to adapt it really built within our genes so just by taking a 20 minute cold shower it can increase norepinephrine by two to three hundred percent and when you increase this neurotransmitter which is made by your adrenal glands and other parts of your body you can really drop inflammation you can increase your antioxidant networks including glutathione so your ability to detox protect against DNA damage is improved also your mitochondria increase as far as the numbers of mitochondria you can generate more energy which is fascinating so taking a cold shower of a period of time can actually boost your energy also your T cells increase these are the cells that help you prevent against infection against viruses and even bacteria now you would think by going into the cold you would get sick but you certain period of time when you do a cold shower I always recommend start off with maybe 30 seconds for a minute and gradually increase it over time and then maybe turn it on to a hot shower and alternate just because pain tends to be very painful so you want to gradually ease into it if here shower it decreases muscle pain and anytime you have an acute injury you want to use cold and not heat that just a side down you also get decreased joint pain joint inflammation especially with rheumatoid arthritis you either a workout or you had an actual injury from sports eg it decreases inflammation in general increases your cognitive function your overall mood there depression and anxiety and also it can even increase your metabolism now I know the last way people want to lose weight is by taking cold showers but it can boost your metabolism a little bit but of course you want to be on keto and intermittent fasting to really do it correctly anyway these are the benefits and comment below if you have ever used cold as a therapy thanks for watching hey if you haven press the button below and I will keep you in the know hey that runs	Success
Will Your Blood Test Detect Vitamin Deficiencies?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T99bxA2XQVk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so the question today is will your blood test actually reveal your vitamin deficiencies a lot of times when you go to the doctor they a complete blood count which they measure that how many red blood cells and white blood cells you have the hemoglobin the iron and then you may get something called the basic metabolic panel which measures a lot of things all basic organ systems a few nutrients it might check iron b12 sodium chloride calcium maybe potassium and in your mind you evaluate all my nutritional deficiencies not quite because what the blood or the serum is not happening inside the cell and if we take magnesium for example 99% of all the magnesium in your body is inside the cell it intracellular and if we take potassium it that means only 2% of your potassium is inside the blood so only 1% of magnesium is in the blood which really does not give the true picture and there things I want to differentiate classical nutritional deficiencies which would be like severe vitamin C vitamin D vitamin b3 or be one like scurvy or rickets or pellagra or berry berry a lot of times you don you don deficiencies you might think we we our diet but no we are some clinical deficiencies and this is where doctors do not put a lot of attention they don training and they definitely do not show up on a blood test these two blood tests right here subclinical nutritional deficiencies will give you certain symptoms of that deficiency but maybe not all of them could relate to the body even protecting your immune system against you know autoimmune conditions so let me give you a couple examples of symptoms with subclinical vitamin deficiencies so if your aid efficient night-vision would be your symptom or problems with the cornea okay of the eye or your skin might be a little bit thicker with D it definitely gonna be low back pain inflammation that sometimes even nose bleeds vitamin E would be weak muscles poor recovery after exercise your muscles do not repair fast enough vitamin k1 bruising easily vitamin b1 would be anxiety or nervous tension be to crack corners in your mouth right through here or crack lips biotin would be problems with your nails it could be brittle nails the ridges in the nails and hair loss and then vitamin C would be bleeding gums and fatigue so these are just a few examples and what you when you do these two tests is a zinc deficiency or selenium and a vitamin D deficiency you have to ask for that separately did you realize that over two billion people on this planet are deficient in zinc and over a billion people are deficient in vitamin D yet these two are not tested often enough the problem with testing zinc especially in the blood is that it goes up and down through the day so depending on when you test ink it could be off by 20% also when you always tell you to do fasting when you before you get your blood test it will spike zinc so you picture so it might show normal but then if you eat something it goes down inflammation when there in the body your zinc will be lower alright dr. Burke so that interesting but how do we test for micronutrient deficiencies well I gonna recommend a blood test that evaluates these nutrients off of your lymphocytes okay it there this it giselle I have no affiliation I don get any kickbacks I put a link down below to check them out but this is one company that I researched and I really like because it gives you an in-depth viewpoint on all these micronutrient deficiencies both trace minerals minerals and vitamins and antioxidants and there as well that you can check out but just realize when you do these basic blood tests you whole picture of what your nutrients for these reasons thanks for watching hey if you haven subscribed press the button below and I will keep you in the know hey that runs	Success
The 9 Benefits of Heat Therapy	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wf1B-YPFzE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let heat therapy now the big contraindication of using heat as a therapy is for acute injuries if he recently created an injury where there inflammation and you put heat on it it gonna make it worse you want to use cold heat is really good for chronic conditions especially chronic injuries so here steam room sauna jacuzzi infrared this is a certain wavelength using light there B and C so B would go one millimeter and C is only going to penetrate the the first lining of cells on your body so they conditions there I video I will do a more detailed video just on that because there talk about contrast bath therapy where you from cold to heat now I really like doing a hot shower cold shower alternate back and forth because it simple to do and you don special equipment you just need a shower so the nine benefits would include decreasing inflammation in your joints as an arthritis especially chronic old injuries decrease muscle spasm usually compensating for an old injury decreasing pain decreasing pain in general but again if it use cold number-6 it reads the waste out of the area and it decreases co2 because you driving in blood flow in oxygen with cold therapy you out of an area and if you alternate with ithi repair you put it back in and if you injury for example I recommend keeping the cold on until it goes through certain stages of intense pain and then numbness and then apply the heat for about you know ten minutes and then we apply the cold go back and forth number eight decrease stiffness number nine increases your recovery especially after a workout so let works certain genes in your body that kick in and are expressed when you add heat or cold and they do different things there shock protein that I want to talk about and basically the response to stress heat and other things as well oxidative stress heavy metals infection so it certain shock in the body or a certain amount of stress that then causes your body to adapt and do better but this specific protein is very interesting because it protects the cell against Mis folding and that about briefly because this is very very important if you take a look at a lot of the chronic diseases out there all Simon have a situation where you have an accumulation of certain proteins in the neurons in the cells that are the endocrine gland cells they can cumulated in the organs and these aggregates or these accumulation of these proteins can are non-functional and they clog up the function normally what happens is you have you the blueprints of the cell are copied into something called the RNA which are basically a code for making proteins in the body I talking about hair nails and skin I talking about all the enzymes the machinery that actually makes up the body and so this genetic code goes into a factory okay it it read and then turned into a certain protein so this comes out and then it activated or folded okay so this protein is folded in a certain shape to make it functional and it looks pretty wild because it like that and so now this protein is activated and it can go and do its work whatever that function is there are proteins that do a lot of different actions they can even they can sometimes they contract sometimes they relax sometimes they spin sometimes they pump sometimes they can walk and move they do all sorts of acts in the body but when you actually add stress in this area and especially heat think about when you heat up food it destroys that enzyme and it makes it very inactive because enzymes are sensitive to heat but if we just a little bit of heat we turn on this protein right here and we can prevent the Mis folding of this folded protein miss folding is basically going to make this protein and active it gonna clump it up more and get it all sticky and things like that so this protein can prevent this from happening which is very very cool just as long as you don mean you don boiling water that would be very very bad and one last thing I about is that when you add fasting okay or in a min of fasting your body goes through a condition called a Toph Ajit and Netaji what it does is it cleans up old damaged proteins as in miss folded proteins that it and stuff that problems and it amino acids that you can use as brand new raw material to make tissue alright thanks for watching hey if you haven already subscribed press the button below and I will keep you in the know hey that runs	Success
How to Reduce the Side Effects of Chemotherapy	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiwCEdUHW_M	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let minimize the side effects from chemotherapy there with chemotherapy number one chemotherapy does not differentiate between healthy cells and cancer cells it destroys them both number two it creates significant side effects that are sometimes even worse than the cancer itself here hair loss bruising infections secondary infection anemia nauseousness vomiting loss of appetite diarrhea reactivation of viruses like herpes weight loss not the good kind of weight loss that you want I and mood changes number three it weakens the immune system with chemotherapy there because you ability to recover so whether you decide to use chemotherapy alternative type therapy radiation therapy I want to at least give you some things that you can do to minimize the side effects and handle the damage control if you decide to go the route of chemo number one realize that cancer lives on sugar and glutamate which is an amino acid and if you look at the strategy of starving off the cancer that might be a very good strategy and I keto reducing your carbohydrates and sugar and also reducing the amount of glutamate in the body the problem is glutamate is in so many different foods but it people they go up with their fat a smaller amount of protein and sometimes they use an amino acid powder instead of actual protein which gives them the key amino acids that they need without too much glutamate and I down below which shows some fascinating data on cancer and using amino acid therapy but when you of fasting you the amount of glutamate the actual food for the cancer there alternative cancer therapies out there one which would be really good Theresa which is called insulin potentiation therapy insulin potentiation therapy looked that up since cancer lives on sugar they inject you with insulin and that drops your blood sugar down and at the same time they small dosage of chemotherapy so when the insulin goes up the blood sugars go down the cancer cells get really really hungry and they start aggressively going after this sugar in the body but if you put a small amount of the chemo with the sugar they will take the lion that and your cells the healthy cells won will and you can kill them off that way it researching number two realize that the way that 90% of people with cancer die is through the cancer spreading through our malignancy and many times it travels into areas of inflammation so if you can reduce inflammation that can slow down the spreading of cancer how do you reduce inflammation you take higher amounts of vitamin D and you do in a minute fasting okay number three hands-down the most effective and most powerful chemo protective in other words something that helps to protect against chemo poly phenyl that plant-based chemical is called EGCG it a very long name which I pronounce of a phytochemical in green tea green tea compared to anything has the most potential protective factors against chemicals and the other very cool thing about this protective property in green tea is that it reduces glutamate the actual food for cancer so it will protect against the chemo it lowers glutamate it can decrease the spread of cancer it can also decrease the tumor size so if you decided to chemo you should be on green team also as a side note taking green tea will not minimize the effect of chemo and on top of that there two additional things that would recommend chlorophyll in the form of wheatgrass juice powder that can actually protect you as well and cruciferous vegetables alright thanks for watching if you content please subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
Vitamin D Deficiency Effects on Your Teeth Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU9o6V0BIZc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let deficiency could affect your teeth now this mainly occurs when your baby just before your teeth are coming in and this condition is basically rickets of the teeth now rickets is a vitamin D deficiency and because rickets affect bone it can affect your teeth as well so let through this number one enamel hypoplasia now what does that mean it means that the enamel or the protective strong coating around the teeth is not developing correctly so it thinned or even in some cases absent that can really increase the risk of that tooth getting a cavity you can develop white spots and a yellow coloring on the tooth little pits on the teeth or grooves that can lead to additional cavities and also sensitivities to cold and Heat number two missing teeth which by the way is very very common and these people had no idea this was simply a vitamin D deficiency and number three delayed teeth so the teeth are not coming in very fast so apparently vitamin D has a huge connection between the enamel on your teeth if the teeth are gonna come in and when the teeth are gonna come in and the reason I talk a lot about vitamin D is because I believe it important vitamin it vitamin it many things it regulates calcium it works also with vitamin k2 because vitamin D increases the calcium in the blood by 20 times guess what you need vitamin k2 you take that calcium that in the blood or in the joints or in soft tissues and drive it into the bone and the teeth so vitamin k2 is very very important in teeth as well when I was a small child I used to crave butter I mean I could literally eat an entire pound of butter in one sitting and I would try to get a lot of butter but my parents were like what are you eating all that butter for right it gonna might have too much cholesterol and clog your arteries but guess what butter is loaded with k2 and that could be why I had pretty much cavities in every single tooth in my head but a vitamin D deficiency also relates to low back pain so if you have lower back pain or any pain in the body or any type of inflammation take some vitamin D it really really works I would recommend 20,000 I use per day and make sure you add with that 200 micrograms of k2 okay so the ratio is for every 10,000 IU d3 you need 100 micrograms of k2 that the the ratios and also vitamin D is essential in your immune system it immune modulator nearly every autoimmune condition is deficient in vitamin D vitamin D deficiencies can set you up for getting viral infections bacterial infections definitely the flu and also loss of bone osteopenia osteoporosis you need d3 and k2 together so in summary I wanted just to emphasize the importance of vitamin D and how it works and number two identify these three things that could occur if you have children it if you have these issues right now and you deficient as a child and you could still be deficient now thanks for watching hey if you haven press the button below and I will keep you in the know hey that runs	Success
Understanding the Women Menstrual Cycle and Estrogen Dominance Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWGzfNaVHiE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	Today we in relationship to the female cycle. Something that very misunderstood. So let let break it down. First of all, let about what a hormone is. Hormones are communications that are created and sent through the blood system. So they created by the gland, sent through the blood, and they connect into a part of the tissue that has receptors for that specific hormone. Right now I to you through the computer into your speaker into your ear and you receiving that information. If I was speaking another language that would be like a different hormone. So the receiver has to understand the language for what it estrogen has receptors in the liver, in the uterus, in the bone, in the brain, in the in the ovary. So it can even go from ovary to ovary as well. So basically we have the glands and glands the difference between a gland and an organ is glands make hormones. Organs don The liver does make a hormone. So but typically glands make hormones sent through the blood and get received over here to create some effect. So hormones are communications. The one we to talk about today is estrogen. Every month, one of your ovaries runs the show and sends the hormones into the into the bud blood on a for a 28 day cycle. So, at day 14, you have the spike of estrogen and then it goes down and this is ovulation when you fertile and then another hormone that the ovary produces called progesterone increases as well. And then at day 28, that cycle. And then this thing starts over and over and over again. So based on when you have the problem during the 28 day cycle, we can kind of tell where the uh where your issue is because a lot of women a week before their period start getting like they feel like they pregnant and it fluid retention, their belly sticks out. Well, we know that estrogen. If the problem is during ovulation, then we know it estrogen. If it know it So the effects that estrogen create in the cell whether it uterus or wherever um or the breast tissue can create um affect the breast, the size of the breast. Uh that there have tenderness in the breast or cysts in the breast, the uterus, uh the menstrual cycle, uh your sex drive, the DNA. So estrogen affects the DNA, the transcription of the of the blueprints. So estrogen can um send a message into the DNA and and tell parts of your body to grow and get bigger. All right? So that why it can create tumors. We that in a little bit. Um estrogen affects the shape of your body. It it feminizes the body and that gives the the lower part, the hips, um a shape. It gives the curve on a female body. That fat, a superficial fat that men don have in the lower part of their bodies. Well, some men do, but most don it gives you the shape. And so, if there to get too much heavy lower part of your body. Um, the bone, it affects the bone, it affects the cognitive, the brain, it affects the electrolytes in the kidneys, the potassium sodium ratio. So you can see it has many many different effects but the function of the ovary is to send hormones into different parts and then one month the one of the ovaries will do do all the work and then the other month the other ovary does the all the um produces the ovulation. So they alternate back and forth between left and right ovary. So depending on what part of your body you have low back pain on, it could be like the right lower part of the back. The next week it like no pain and then it could be the right side. Then we know the right ovary could be producing too much estrogen. So they alternate or even sometimes you get acne on the one side of your face versus the other side. So again, the ovary produces these hormones that create all sorts of different effects in the body. Now, probably the most common problem with the ovary is the overp production of estrogen. They call it estrogen dominance. It what happens with too much estrogen? You periods, cramping, no periods, irregular periods, irregular cycles, uh long periods, heavy bleeding, every single problem with that period will be disrupted with too much estrogen. And one of the one of the triggers for too much estrogen, we part, but it could be uh low progesterone. Because if the estrogen causes no periods, there trigger the progesterone release and so therefore the progesterone goes down even more and then the relative ratio of estrogen goes up like a teeter totter. So estrogen and progesterone work like this. So when you don this, this kind of goes up in the relative ratios just like salt and potassium. So if you have too much salt, your potassium is going to go down. Same effect. So estrogen can cause no periods and then there then that makes more estrogen. So it kind of a an interesting thing. Okay. Headaches come from too much estrogen. Fluid retention can come from estrogen dominance. Fibroids, endometriosis, which is extra growth of of tissue in the female cavity through here can come from estrogen dominance as well. And um because remember we talked about DNA. DNA it affects the blueprints. It makes tissue grow. It increases the size of different things. So fibroids definitely come from estrogen dominance. Cysts come from estrogen dominance. And you can have cysts in the ovaries. You can have it on the breast. Um and that could that comes from estrogen dominance as well. Gall stones. Why? Because estrogen concentrates the cholesterol in the gallbladder there thereby creating stones. So gall stones are a real common trigger from high levels of estrogen and they usually see them after pregnancy simply because the spike of estrogen during the cycle in the in the pregnancy. Okay. Then we have cancer. Too much estrogen can trigger cancer. And that medications they use as an anti-cancer blocker would be tmoxifen which blocks the receptors for estrogen decreasing the risks. So cancer is definitely triggered by too much estrogen. And then the thyroid can be diminished with too much estrogen. Why? Because the thyroid also has receptors for I tiny picture here. Receptors for estrogen. So if there estrogen in the body, it can block the receptors in the thyroid and not not let the thyroid hormones get in thereby decreasing the function of the thyroid. So we have a secondary low thyroid called hypothyroid coming from an estrogen dominant situation and that of women with thyroid problems after pregnancy after being exposed to a lot of estrogen. So I would, this is my guess, I would say most thyroid cases are this problem right here, not primary. So those are some of the effects that estrogen dominance can create on the body. So the next question is what causes estrogen dominance? Well, the first thing is our environmental. First of all, we are in an environment that so bathed with so much estrogen that I mean it and insecttoides, herbicides, fungicides, heavy metals, country and western. I you have DDT. Now DDT was banned in 1971. Yet we atapost tissue, our fat tissue, and even in kids. Why? Because we use it in the US, but we it to third world countries where we buy our fruits and vegetables in the in the winter. So it comes right back and goes right into our body. DDT mimics estrogen. So environmentally they call it endocrine disruptors which are really chemicals in the environment that mimic estrogen. And our cells can receive or pick up the tissues can receive these chemicals and they can act like estrogen. And that books on toxicology, the study of poisons show the relationship between these chemicals, pesticides and things and hormone disruption. So we have that number one. Um HRT, hormone replacement therapy used to be called estrogen replacement therapy, but they found estrogen causes cancer. So what they did is they add a little bit of progesterone to buffer it, which did decrease the cancer risk by some amount. And then they call it hormone replacement therapy. But these estrogens that are synthetic, which are by um made from horse urine, uh pregnant horses are a lot different than our bodies. Our bodies as humans were not designed to be exposed to horse estrogens. Um so it does create a lot of problems for females when they have to take HRT. And then birth control pills, estrogen. The next one is soy. Specifically, soy protein isolates. 95% of soy protein isolates are genetically modified, but they protein, it the in the breakfast cereals, in the baby food, in the uh protein bars, in the diet shakes. Um, a lot of these diets use the soy protein isis because it McDougall, MD, has found that soy protein isolates can influence fibroids and tumors in the liver. Okay. Progesterone decreases. We talked about that in the last section. Really, when you start losing your period around um premenopause or pmenopause, I You can then have a problem with decreased progesterone and relative increase estrogen because they work on a reciprocal basis. So that can also be one of the problems that we with. And so we also have liver problems. Now the liver is where you actually detoxify estrogen, too much of it. So if that liver is healthy, you can get rid of a lot of this extra estrogen. But if you gallbladder problems and liver toxicity because your diet you down this excess estrogen. And that could be another culprit to estrogen dominance. So, these are some of the common causes of estrogen dominance. So, I want to make one point about menopause. I have a lot of clients that tell me, estrogen because I menopause. So, therefore, I need to take estrogen in the thoughts that if they don Alzheimer really old and heart disease. In fact, there would love to find some research. the next time someone tells you that, ask for the research. It there. See, you have a backup organ during menopause. The adrenal glands on top of your kidney produce the same uh hormones as the ovaries do. Not in the same quantity, but the same hormones. So, what in nature is the ovaries shut down or they stop working and then all this work is done on the adrenals. What we seeing is this. people going into menopause with burntout adrenals everything they those ovaries effectively and then they end up with all these problems with hot flashes, night sweats and vaginal dryness and a lot of weight gain because now the adrenals have to work harder and they get this bigger stomach and belly fat. So really if there adrenals before menopause, it exaggerated after menopause. Okay? So they go from one problem to a worse problem and then people take what called they start taking hormones and the problem there and even the biioidentical hormones. Here bioidentical hormones. Remember we talked about the gland that makes hormones. Hormones are the communications. The gland is a thing that makes the hormones and it over here to something else. Instead of focusing on the hormone where basically the problem is not really the hormone, it gland. Very few people support the thing that makes the hormone because when you take even bioidentical hormones, you actually inactivate your own gland that makes that hormone. Same thing with the thyroid. When you medication or thyroid hormones, your gland doesn goes to sleep over time. You shrivel it up. So that people jumping and start taking hormones because you your own body you should do is take a look at how you can support the gland. Okay, we that in the next section. Okay, so now what do we do about this? There are four solutions that I I recommend. phytoestrogens. That that would be all those vegetables that people never eat like the cruciferous vegetables, kale, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage. Those foods are anti-estrogenic, which means they help balance your estrogens. They going to decrease the good estrogens. They they protect against cancer. Um, so and and again, as far as the solution, um, this is my disclaimer. I you that any of these will help you with any diseases, uh, will prevent any diseases. Uh, I are going to treat a disease. So, check with your doctor with that. That disclaimer. Okay. These are just things that can help support a healthy menstrual cycle. Okay. All right. So, we got phytoestrogens. Um, very few people have enough of those. I highly recommend start eating those. That shake is so important. If you have not done the kale shake, go to drbird.com, the front page, and scroll down and download that eating plan because it it shows you how to make the kale shakes every morning. It Everyone should be on that kale shake. Avoid estrogens. Well, here Um, I medication, check with your doctor, but start avoiding estrogens in the uh in the food supply. You have hormones in all the butter, the cheese, the milk, the dairy, the beef, the chicken, the turkey. So, have foods that are hormone free. All right? Because there estrogen in those foods. Also, have more organic vegetables. Now, if you cannot afford it, at least don from Chile and Mexico. Buy vegetables that are in the country. That way, you don you don or not. It we want to avoid estrogens. We want to support the gland. So, um, I created something that I clinic to support a healthy ovary and uterus because it supports both. And I don but it formula. And this is what I recommend for clients just to help balance things and improve things overall. And then ma and for a maintenance as well. So, I recommend three of these and they are a nutritional blend that supports not just the ovaries but the the uterus as well. And it doesn nutrients that that target the gland itself. Okay? So, we want to support the gland. Um, and then we want to eat foods that support the liver. And that in my book, the seven principles of fat burning, I talk the first eating plan that everyone does is the liver enhancement. Why? Because that way we can support the liver. the liver can then balance any excess of estrogen that shouldn that support the liver also support estrogen because there are certain things in the liver that regulate estrogen or buffer excessive toxic amounts of estrogen. So those are four very simple things you should focus on to help your situation and your cycle.	Success
Reasons for Deficiency of Vitamin D Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatYZxyoEkU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey Dr Berg here in this video we going to talk about vitamin D in relationship to why everyone all of a sudden is deficient in vitamin D so I going to give you the basics of it and then I some Basics number one our bodies need about 1,200 international units of vitamin D per day okay that amount it might go up or down depending on several factors one is your stress level because obviously if you sick or more stressed you need more um the foods that have vitamin D would be cod oil that grandmother recommended that uh fatty fish uh butter cheese cream uh raw milk very high in vitamin D but most people get it from the sun because what happens is the UV lights convert cholesterol on your skin just turn that cholesterol into um a chemical reaction that occurs to your liver and kidney that then eventually makes vitamin D so your body will make vitamin D from Sun in the inneraction of the cholesterol on your skin okay so that to support bone so in a child you could have if you have this thing called rickets which is very weak Bones the Bones start bending so there is a connection between vitamin D and Bone I in a little bit the immune system highly uh sensitive to vitamin D so if you vitamin D deficient you can have immune problems um but vitamin D is is not really like a vitamin it acts like a hormone it is a hormone it prehormone so it turns into a steroid it when you get vitamin D from the pharmacy they they make it synthetically you want a more of a natural form all right so now why all of a sudden is everyone deficient inde D that couple reasons for it number one MDS only recently have been testing vitamin D previously they haven for it so that could be one reason um number two people don sun as much especially as you get older you because of the scare of skin cancer and things like that so people are not going out in the sun kids don sun as much we behind a computer um also low cholesterol diets remember Sun converts the cholesterol into Vitamin D so we need cholesterol so if you or you cholesterol diet it could be that could be a culprit you don material to build vitamin D or it could be a lack of something called bile I done videos on this bile is the detergent that breaks down the grease it is a fluid from your liver that breaks down fats specifically fat soble vitamins vitamin D is a fat soble vitamin without bio you can vitamin D so it could be a digestive liver issue okay and that doctor gives you so much recommend so much vitamin uh D per per week like I had people come in there taking 50,000 milligrams like way more than you would need once a week not every not spread out but once a week and if they don vitam uh it hypervitaminosis vitamin D that actually vitamin D toxicity that the symptoms for vitamin D toxicity would be the calcium starts clogging up your heart your lungs the kidneys you get kidney stones you get all sorts of weakness in the muscle you get really you have a lot of fatigue so just because you are deficient doesn you need to go overboard and go the other direction and go way over the edge so you need bile to absorb vitamin D and make it work and the last thing is not very known but stress specifically the stress hormone called cortisol cortisol is the adrenal hormone the stress hormone that competes for other steroid steroids like in other words this stress hormone goes in the body and it there won so now vitamin D doesn because vitamin D is a steroid so is cortisol they almost hormone like so when you have a lot of cortisol or stress you block the ability to absorb vitamin D and honestly I think this is probably the more the most common reason why people have low vitamin D levels is stress um so we have that and also the flight or fight mode um the adrenaline rush lack of sleep oh my gosh it have low vitamin D levels so that that does and now I want to show you some interesting data about the opposing hormone now very few people know about this but in nature all vitamins are synergistic they work with other vitamins vitamin D has a synergistic vitamin called vitamin F in other words they work together as a teeter to totter type mechanism when one goes up the other one goes down but the function of vitamin D is to take the calcium from the stomach and put it into the blood the purpose of vitamin f is to take the calcium from the blood and put it into the skin tissue okay and that is why vitamin f is a protective mechanism against all types of skin problems uh maybe you have never heard of vitamin F it polyunsaturated fatty acids so that would be um like the safflower oil the flax oil the Walnut and walnut oil sunflower oil pumpkin seed oils or pumpkin seeds fatty fish there e there some actually even some vitamin F in in butter too there cive oil and there food that you have a 50/50 split of vitamin d and vitamin F and that would be codiv oil which your grandmother was correct um so so those vitamins work together now vitamin D is the sun milk products cream cheese raw milk and then we have the vitamin F this is more saturated fats these are unsaturated fats okay so they work together now if if you F you will get hives you will get thick skin like a farmer that so long his uh skin becomes very very very thick and that is because you getting all this vitamin D vitamin D toxicity which automatically reduces your vitamin F which automatically drops your calcium in the skin and leaves you vulnerable for sunstroke uh sunburns all sorts of skin problems um so here problem what you want to do is you want to consider that they always have vitamin f with vitamin D um hives muscle cramps sunburn um it would be difficult to get sunburn if you had enough vitamin F in your bloodstream so if you actually do have sunstroke go ahead and go in the house and start consuming more FL black oil or something like that to get more of that vitamin F and that will help you heal that sunburn very very fast but it the skin um canker Source viruses come out of remission when you vitamin D because vitamin I vitamin F okay so vitamin F goes down viruses come out of remission because there virus in check and keep it back in remission so viruses come out of remission when you F uh that would be canker source so that highly linked with this um the other interesting point is that um polio which is a virus always tended to come come out outbreaks in the late fall or the early uh no the early fall late summer um what else papala viruses come out in the late summer the flu comes out in the fall which is right after summer a lot of virus outbreaks occur after the summer months when you have all this vitamin D and that depleting your vitamin F making you susceptible for these viruses to come out the virus is already in there it just coming out um the other thing is the cervical cancer which is viral related uh cancer of the cervix that those outbreaks come out in the late summer which I just find that being an interesting connection um I don if that correlates so this is the relationship make sure that you balance it out and understand this because you don need Vitamin D you need Vitamin F to keep the whole thing working and now you understand how it all works and so make sure that you consume a lot of these omega-3 fatty acids in your diet and that will kind of keep you out of trouble so the other thing I want to mention is that it just taking vitamin D it could be you don bile you need bile salts to be able to digest the the vitamins the fat CYO vitamin so you can start pulling in the vitamin D in the bloodstream and there really nothing wrong with being being out in the sun as long as you have vitamin A to protect you and that way it so you want to take all this data and look at the whole picture not just like this like through a little microscope and so that I hope you enjoyed it it and write down any comments about it below and I will see you in the next video	Success

What's Missing In Healthcare is the Health Part Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOdBZpqay6Q	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we health care okay so what health care it it healthy but there there and the reason is because only 25 of all medical schools even require you get even one class of nutrition and those 25 that do requirement required only get about between 11 and 20 hours of training and nutrition i just not enough so what do they do they refer to the dietitian so what do the dietitians do they analyze the diet and they recommend certain foods right but did you realize that they that they have to go to every year is sponsored by the food and beverage companies yeah the food manufacturing companies if you go to a website called beverageinstitute.org i down there you will find coca-cola has this website and it nutrition and health and wellness center and they give continued educational credits by all sorts of doctors that they pay to do the seminars so not only do the food and beverage in coca-cola sponsor these trainings uh they actually do them themselves okay so they don educational building and things but they actually deliver the seminars on very selective things that they want them to to be taught number one they talk about because you can download the notes right off that website it they how these urban legends and it these myths on they are aspartame is bad or phosphor is bad for your bones so it moderation high fructose corn syrup they high fructose corn syrup gmos how there the scientific research sugar and they said there and hyperactive kids yeah i right to the list it information that is being pushed out to the dietitian and then there problem with artificial colorings so in the in their ingredients so you can see that there information that dietitians so no wonder people are not going to get the right information so i think it marketing tactic by the food companies to be able to get in there to be able to train them so that running into a situation with going to a dietitian trying to actually even lose weight they influenced by these other companies so the bottom line is this doctors don correct nutritional information because they that the doctors send people to the dietitians are taught by the wrong source coca-cola so what is the health part because there training in health by doctors and the dietitians are being taught by coca-cola but there and it has to do with healthcare has become the management of symptoms okay the management of symptoms management of effects you get a symptom you get it labeled and then you get it treated but what about the evaluation what about the investigation of finding out what causing certain things you have high sugar okay that and it sugar and how do we get it corrected that is never questioned high blood pressure hypertension why what causes it we don we just treat it directly high cholesterol why acid reflux we call acid reflux disorder right or acid reflux disease no no no all these are symptoms they just collapse the two together call them diseases and then they treat them to make them sound scientific what missing is the evaluation part gerd for example gastroesophageal reflux disorder now the gastrois means a digestive system like the stomach esophagus comes up through here reflux disorder so we about description of all the different connecting dots as it it symptoms this is the problem if you actually treat the symptom you to continue the symptom and you to camouflage the real root problem so i mean i can see if you have a fever and they found a microbe like a staph infection you treat it that the true cause the staph infection is the is the cause of the symptom and is treated by an antibiotic if you have pain and you get an x-ray it a cast that sense to me but this other system does not make sense and i know why because there curing or correcting anything it become very over specialized we have special specialists in every single thing including the retina of your eye retinologist you even have doctors of the like a knee doctor or a foot doctor or a toe doctor right so um doctors don sometimes all of the clues or the symptoms to associate that them together i book called siba and here 84 we take this condition called it adrenal cortisol okay it cushing syndrome in cushing you have allergies you have skin problems you have inflammation you have cognitive excessive thinking all the time you have high blood pressure bone loss right here you have all sorts of hypertension you have that you have insomnia sleep apnea low vitamin d levels acid reflux right here see if can you imagine okay so you wanna you have all these symptoms and you list them on a page and you can treat each one of them with a separate drug you the real problem the cushing adrenal the hyperactivity is never corrected but this is what happens is that everything is separated okay so now we know that but why why why is this going on here number one i think there in nutrition number one i it and number two the doctors are trained by the drug companies they sponsor the continuing educational trainings you have the drug rep that trains the doctors a lot of the journals that the doctors read are highly influenced by drug companies who do the the research so it drug i think the cure of this whole problem is this that i think the doctors should get way more training and emphasis on health and nutrition is that going to happen probably not because there here happy it money drugs are not making people healthier and the problems are not getting fixed so people are turning to alternative so that of healthcare hope you got a couple things under that and i will see you in the next video	Success
Benefits of Iodine: The Healing Trace Minerals for Cysts, Thyroid, PCOD and more Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpNqXUzwqPs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	in this video we iodine I awareness on this vitally important trace mineral now trace minerals are those minerals needed in very small amounts but the problem is there RTA minerals only for the bigger minerals like calcium and vitamins and things like that but trace trace minerals are those minerals needed in very very tiny amounts usually micrograms not milligrams okay but iodine is definitely needed because the function of iodine supports the brain function in a growing infant without enough iodine that child could be mentally all cells need iodine so not just the thyroid the reproductive organs need iodine including the breast the uterus the ovaries the prostate the testicles we get more into that in the next section but the point is that if a female has very large breasts they need more iodine to support those breasts okay iodine is also used to help detoxify heavy metals so if you have if you consuming a lot of shellfish and you getting mercury and things if you have enough iodine on your system that will protect the detail will help you detoxify it iodine is needed to reduce the need for insulin so it diabetes or slowing down diabetes it involved in stabilizing blood sugars and you know I some other things that people can do if they iodine it could take a big stress off the whole mechanism with blood sugars and of course the one of the most important things for iodine is the control of metabolism through the thyroid so if there your metabolism could be shut down by at least fifty percent or more and then you gain weight okay so if you relationship to like thyroxine or t4 or t3 and what that means is that the number associated with that T like thyroid t3 or four that of iodine molecules that are attached to that thyroid hormone okay so that that means and so when the thyroid sends out a hormone and it sends out t4 that the one that it starts with but it inactive and even when people take medication like synthroid for example that is made active or activated by the liver and the kidney so in other words eight eighty percent of t4 is converted through the liver through the gallbladder through the bile ducts and 20% of the t4 is converted through the kidneys so one cause of thyroid problems or iodine problems would be the lack of the conversion because the gall bladders not there or there the gall bladder the livers damaged or there reasons too one side note is that you need the other trace mineral inium to convert t4 to t3 and that when you in a concentrate of a blend of all the trace minerals not just one you have to really look at a holistic approach with that so so we have that now let about just the causes of iodine deficiencies there indirect causes and the reason I showing this is because I want to expand your awareness on all the possibilities so we don don yeah we checked your thyroid it but they the kidney the iodine in your diet all these factors all right so first first thing is it could be just low iodine it could come from the diet why because the soils really don in it especially unless you live about a hundred miles from the ocean there really no more iodine in the soils so you replace that they replace it with maybe nitrogen phosphorus and potassium but not all the trace minerals so you consuming food without iodine that could be why you normal requirement that our body needs is a hundred and fifty micrograms so it set up I think by some standards that were a bit too low because in the in Japan they times more iodine than Americans and they have a lot less thyroid problems breast cancer cyst on the breast and ovarian problems unless prostate problems then Americans so I think there that but it could be also the person is maybe eating a bit too much cruciferous but honestly you would have to consume a lot of cruciferous to create an iodine deficiency so not just a couch like a day but if you are consuming a lot of cruciferous I highly recommend that you add a source of iodine to your diet I get into that in a little bit because that cruciferous does have a tendency to deplete or block some small amounts of iodine okay so we have that and then we have low salt diet so if someone low salt diet and they salt likes even sea salt then where they get near iodine they not even doing iodized salt so that could be one possible reason we just want to look at every possible reason stress stress can also deplete iodine in the minerals and then a thing called endocrine disrupters that would be something like an exposure to pesticides insecticides herbicides fungicides right from the food or from the environment that can also mess with your thyroid and block the absorption of iodine because these endocrine disruptors these chemicals do compete for the receptors for iodine so let receptor right here and iodine is supposed to go in there like that well what happens is the endocrine disrupters will block it so they won let that iodine connect in there and that could be some of the heavy metals like mercury and it could be other elements like fluoride chloride and even the sink called bromide alright bromide is a very interesting element because in the 70s we used to have iodine in all the flour products the bakery products okay but then they switched it with bromide I don why they did that so in the past people were getting iodide and then in the 70s we had a bromine without the iodine and guess what that alone can decrease your absorption of iodine by having too much bromine in your breads pasta cereal crackers biscuits waffles pancakes of course you watching my blog anyway so you don have nothing to worry about okay so we have those things that can interfere just directly low iodine from that now there could also have a low iodine number one high levels of estrogen can block your iodine all right it can also increase the need for more iodine interesting so that could explain why when you get pregnant the spike of estrogen you end up with a thyroid problem yeah because of the spike of estrogen severely blocks the iodine absorption into the Vaught thyroid so what are all the sources of increased estrogen number one getting pregnant to hormonal placement therapy three birth control pills eating foods without that are not hormone free could do it there that have hormones and then having too much soy soy is estrogenic especially if it always have fermented soy I like tofu tempeh tempeh miso soup they don consume the soy protein isolates in the prepackaged diet foods that that are out there the veggie patties that vegetarians consume with it all soy base a lot of the protein powders um it the baby food you name it having a fibroid which by the way is caused by high estrogen can also deplete the iodine in the body and obstruct the thyroid and then having a very heavy or regular or painful cycle which is estrogen dominance can also lower your iodine okay and then lastly we talked about this briefly before a liver damage so if you have liver damage it could be that could be the source of your your low iodine or your lack of conversion into the thyroid or a lack of bile now I and bile and biles the detergent to helps break down the grease and without enough bio you won conversion and that can mess up the thyroid or I the active form of the thyroid hormone to make it work so it so it really doesn blood test that doesn they possible causes of a thyroid problem and so what causes low bile is sometimes when you become a vegetarian you have no saturated fats well saturated fats some such artifacts stimulate the bio released without saturated fats you can shrivels up and you don file anymore that could be one cause and then stress high levels of the stress hormone from the adrenal called cortisol that one that makes the belly fat that can also block your bio therefore decreasing your iodine so those are all the possible causes and then the next part I to show you all the symptoms of iodine deficiency so let symptoms of iodine deficiency number one you get fat you gain weight all over that would be a thyroid body type why because all the cells are controlled by the thyroid and iodine so all the cells get fat on them it affects the cognitive it makes you feel very very sluggish and brain fog especially in the morning you just feel like you waking up you refreshed that is one symptom even your IQ but why because again remember the iodine effect the brain especially in a growing person but also an adult too so not that you will feel mentally but you could feel a little mentally psychiatric disorders mental retardation also are a lot of them are iodine deficiency and of course they just treat them with drugs unfortunately they not looking at the nutrition why because they only 25% of the colleges universities that teach medical doctors teach nutrition and out of those about they teach them 6 to 11 hours maybe 20 hours so you because they just don information on these key natural remedies okay so we have that cancer can also be as a symptom of an iodine deficiency so if you want to go to a great website and now post it down here Jeffery Dodge it it down there and this medical doctor basically found that you can put a lot of breast cancer in remission by adding iodine to the diet so I want you to read that if you have worried about cancer and that the breast cancer of the stomach and other cancers ok fibrocystic breasts oh my gosh there taking iodine for fibrocystic breast to eliminate that problem why because the breast needs iodine and without it it forms little cysts especially if you when you concentrate a lot of iodine and that why it consume enough of that trace mineral before she during the pregnancies in a very small amount so that baby gets enough iodine because without it she sorts of weird things to try to get it but she might not get it okay so Farber cystic breast is a symptom of iodine problem cysts on the ovaries or the testicle prostate enlargement could be an iodine deficiency the Russian fatigue slow thyroid Gorder a bulge of a thyroid right there enlarges that could be a iodine deficiency a lot of menstrual cycle issues polycystic ovarian syndrome that would be those there acne they get gut wait and one of the doctors who they put them on metformin because they try to treat them for insulin resistance but what about iodine given some iodine see what happens salivary saliva deficiency so your mouth can get really dry or dry eyes because the ducts the salivary glands or the other glands don things can dry out that could be a iodine deficiency and then thyroid nodules and then migraines and then miscarriages or stillbirths all that can be iodine deficiency interesting foods that have high iodine would be strawberries eggs yogurt and seek help but check this out you would have to consume because the soils are so bad 11 cups of strawberries to get your daily amount of iodine so who that six eggs I have four a day so I two more or two large cups of yogurt every day to get your iodine no one does that so or you can do one eighth of a cup of seek help but of course what I recommend is do it in the capsule I gonna recommend you get some seek help three to six capsules a day of about 500 to 600 milligram tablets now that doesn milligrams of iodine that just means they trace minerals so it but what that it selenium to convert the thyroid from t4 to t3 it words it element that our body has a hard time absorber absorbing our bodies absorb plant base trace minerals and just minerals in general we do not do well with things that are not coming from a plant source or another source so we need the plant source that was seek help and then also you don about trying to take a steroid supplement that like an high dosage because a lot of times doctors use high dosages of iodine because it doesn absorb because they don plant base if you do plant base you don absorb it and it breaks it down very easily so it approach it for the body to start absorbing it over time so that recommend for you so I hope this increased your awareness and I will see you in the next video	Success
How To Stop Procrastinating & Improve Low Willpower? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Izi-PNI7_Dc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	one of the worst things that a person could do is self- diagnose or get the wrong diagnosis like you might say I too lazy or a friend says oh you too lazy that naturally lazy people in fact it that you have low willpower or your procrastinator let little deeper of really why people think that they have low willpower or they lazy number one they don well any one that doesn going to give up that that occurs so that reason these are this no results is a symptom of something else you getting results because the problem is a metabolism problem not a weight problem so we want to differentiate what the problem is because if you think you have a weight problem and it could be a metabolism problem because the fat burning hormones are not working because the body type is is dominant like let you have an adrenal body type you will hold weight in the midsection if it liver you midsection too but it pot belly right through here if it ovarian problem you the saddle bags down here yet if it thyroid you at anyone location so again instead of just focusing on losing weight go deeper and see maybe it metabolism messed up because your hormones are off this is the underlying cause number two cravings it impossible to do a long-term eating plan a healthy eating plan when you craving anything so when you all that means is that your body is not burning fat it sugar and I recommend that we get to the root of this and reduce the Cravings so you can actually tab in the fat because when you craving anything and that you running on sugar all the time that what happens is as soon as you eat the sugar it drops down you sugar and you problem is not that you just crave the wrong things because your blood sugars are messed up because the underlying cause is you don enough potassium in your body to regulate the sugars so that recommend the kale shake or at least seven cups of vegetables per day and watch the Cravings go down to zero it takes like three days try that third thing you maybe say I exercise right and you think you that exhausted to be able to exercise they not healthy enough to exercise they too tired and I never recommend exercising if you people will say oh yeah you need exercise to get energy yeah just to spike your adrenaline and then your next day you want to get energy to be able to exercise and feel like you want to exercise and the way we do that if we get to the root of it we have to fix your sleeping problem we have to start getting longer sleep more sleep and tweak that right there that underlying cause Okay the fourth most common real reason why people think they misdiagnosed is that there stress eaters stress um one way to relas stress is through different foods chemicals and foods like when you eat a refined carbohydrate or sugar all it it are releasing stress and when you tired hungry or stress you be more reactive you think about tomorrow you want it right now and not really even think about it why because you to solve a problem so stress eaters are really burnt out they usually have adrenal burnout and that is keeping the tolerance for stress low and they constantly looking for ways to reduce stress so rather than focus on the carbs go more fatty foods like have more egg eggs egg yolk have more cheese butter even some bacon that not increase the carb I mean the uh that won satisfy you more and that substitute for the carb um there substitute uh foods that you can consume like with Xylitol or Stevia or other alternative sugars but stress eaters are basically burned out and they have to increase their ability or capacity for their adrenals to work so their stress goes down so these are some underlying root causes symptoms versus causes and just so you know you the wrong diagnosis you you is slow or your blood sugar is off that	Success
How to Reduce Lung (Respiratory) Mucus	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dlBAKYue88	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today I good natural remedy for respiratory mucus now this could be either a bacterial infection or a viral infection I taking vitamin D zinc but I want to talk about a natural remedy that you can use in the meantime to get this mucus out of the lungs while your immune system clears out the virus and bacteria so let expectorant it to increase fluid in the lungs which allow the infected mucus to be released so if you go the drugstore and you looking for ways to deal with mucus in your lungs there are things that help remove the mucus there are things that suppress the mucus there are things that thin the mucus and an expectorant is something that expels the mucus out of your lungs and the Latin word for expectrum is to expel or banish now one of the best remedies that I used when I was in practice is called ammonium chloride now this compound was in a product called Cal Amino sold by a company called standard process it very difficult to find it online you have to find a practitioner that actually uses standard process that sells it but it seems to work really good on several things one would be the mucous arthritis any type of inflammatory process so ammonium chloride is a whole-body acidifier and anytime you acidify the body whether it betaine hydrochloride or ammonium chloride you tend to stimulate these things called phagocytes which help to clean up the body it immune system but ammonium chloride is used in a lot of Coffman occations it also was used in certain arthritic medications that were over-the-counter back in the 50s and I think the 40s but for some reason they took it out but it has a natural expectorant effect it breaks down mucus and in other countries like Finland Scandinavia Netherlands North Germany Egypt Iran they use this compound in something called salty licorice so they combine licorice with ammonium chloride and they put it in these little candies the problem I see is that it dextrose corn starch now they do have sugar-free versions but they usually use sugar alcohols like multi tall which creates a lot of digestive issues and it I like the concept but I just don the added sugar because licorice in addition to all the benefits for your digestive system supports the flow of healthy mucus and when you combine these two together you have a really good synergistic expectorant that can pull the mucus out and help with chronic coughing for example so in summary if you have mucus in the lungs and you want something fairly natural you could either get these individually okay or you can get this online or you can get them combined if you could find something that doesn sugar all right thanks for watching if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
Why Do You Get Heart Palpitations After Eating? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IwNcN1RN8o	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so why would someone get heart palpitations after they eat let about that first of all what is the palpitation it beat as well you also have PVCs and pa CS this stands for premature ventricular contractions or premature atrial contractions you don all you need to know is both of these are extra abnormal beats that can occur a palpitation is an irregular heartbeat it chest area like a flip-flop or something that starts and stops and it has to do with your heart pacemaker it cardiac pacemaker a pacemaker is a group of cells that are automatically programmed to keep the heart and rhythm an average person at rest normally has a heartbeat of 70 70 beats per minute and what rhythmic electrical impulse that causes the heart to contract which pushes the blood through the lungs to get oxygen carries it through the body gives oxygen to the cells which comes back through the other side of the heart and the whole cycle starts over again at the cellular level you exchange with different electrolytes okay which are electrically charged minerals like potassium and sodium and magnesium and chloride and calcium and you have these little tiny pumps that are made of protein that are pumping in and out of the cells at a very very fast rate like a thousand per second these different electrolytes and what causes the electrolytes to travel are the difference in electrical charge the difference in pH and the difference in concentration of certain minerals and on top of that you have a part of the nervous system called the autonomic nervous system so it let palpitations and by the way palpitations skip heart beats are a precursor for a more serious problem like atrial fibrillation and other more it Vance problems with the rhythm of the heartbeat but let causes and the ones that are more common than others the big one is digestion when I was in practice there people that came in with palpitations and digestive problems and I about heartburn acid reflux GERD and gall bladder issues and that could be burping belching bloating gall stones sludge in the gall bladder and a lot of those cases had complications so what is the connection well we don know but it that and a lot of times when you have a gall bladder problem you have a buildup of pressure somewhere in the tubes between the liver and the gallbladder or the liver and the small intestine and when that pressure builds up it can create a lot of soft tissue guarding and tension and spasm around the area and because the bile ducts and the gallbladder are so closely connected to the cardiovascular system that pressure can then affect the heart and cause these palpitations I what to do about that in a little bit but let this is probably one of the top causes as well why because potassium is the main electrolyte that controls the pacemaker and if you go up for you getting palpitations and other problems even atrial fibrillation which is a more advanced version of that number three let alkaline and what I alkaline I goes higher okay the lower you get the more acidic things are if the blood pH which normally should be between seven point three five and seven point four five goes above seven point four or five even a little bit your body is now excessively alkaline it alkalosis that occurs the minerals specifically potassium doesn well through the body through the heart so if your pH is too alkaline that could be the cause and before caffeine too much caffeine can cause this problem to which alcohol a hyper thyroid condition I I want to focus on these two right here which are the more common let look at that right now all right so if you have digestive problems whether bloating heartburn GERD acid reflux I put some links down below so you can get a lot more information on what to do about it but the simple thing to do would be to start doing in a minute fasting for those of you that are new to my channel I put a link down below if you new to my channel you know what a minute fasting is because that is the most powerful thing that you can do to take the pressure off the digestive system and let the digestive system actually reset and heal especially the gallbladder you also need to avoid refined carbohydrates and vegetable oils like in soy oil in corn oil these two types of so-called foods are very very hard on the gallbladder and the stomach and they causing that pressure build up in those tubes simple thing to do would be do healthy ki tale put a link down below for those of you that don that is that will help the digestion and that will decrease the risk of getting these palpitations alright number two alkalinity if you have low potassium that could be the cause of your body being too alkaline if you have high cortisol if you could be the reason why your body is too alkaline I know a lot of people are trying to alkalize the body because they think they the case but there problem of being too alkaline and that will affect the minerals especially potassium I put a link down below if you understand pH also low hydrochloric acid okay like in your stomach that can create a problem with your pH as well in which case you want to start consuming apple cider vinegar some through the diet if you do a combination of healthy keto like I for this I always recommend apple cider vinegar with that program so you should kill two birds with one stone next thing and this is very very common you just have low potassium that to set you up for this problem now why are you low in potassium maybe you a diuretic because you have high blood pressure well guess what there things that cause high blood pressure one would be low potassium so in other words the low potassium is causing the high blood pressure which causes you to take a diuretic which depletes your potassium you see the problem there also if you of people are that can cause hypertension and deplete your potassium reserves and if you have high insulin which the majority population has or you have insulin resistance or you pre-diabetic that can cause a depletion of potassium diarrhea that can also deplete your potassium levels as well as other electrolytes if you assets that can cause low potassium because it takes a very strong acid stomach to absorb these minerals thus the outside of vinegar in your diet and lastly let consuming enough dietary potassium this is very common why because you don consume enough vegetables it takes seven to ten cups of vegetables to get close to your daily amount of potassium that your body needs so you need to up these if you put a link down below of an electrolyte powder that may help you as well all right there you have it the actual causes of palpitations after you eat and when you well thanks for watching hey if you liking this content please subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success
Benfotiamine: Why Every Diabetic Should Take It	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmYrJ0s7QQU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we nutrient called benfotiamine and this is a synthetic b1 b1 is naturally water Seibel this is a fat-soluble b1 and yes it is made synthetically but this is one of the only synthetic vitamins that I would recommend because it has virtually no side effects and I believe every single diabetic should be taking benfotiamine and here vitamin b1 is intimately involved in the little mini engine in your mitochondria that involves the glucose metabolism and the more glucose that you have running through that machine the higher the blood sugar the more depleted of b1 you diabetics there are involved the nerves and brain the eyes the kidney and the heart vessels and it just so happens that benfotiamine can help you with each one of them now because benfotiamine is fat soluble it can penetrate 3 to 5 times deeper into the nerves in your brain and it can really create some really cool effects its main function is it protects against oxidation and this is really that the problem with diabetes you have so much glucose involved that the amount of oxidation is so high you sorts of free radical damage you getting complications all the tissues start breaking down simply because of the oxidation of glucose well any type of b1 will counter that but benfotiamine goes a little bit deeper benfotiamine will also reduce advanced glycation end-products now what is that when you combine glucose with the protein or glucose with the fat under heat you start creating these these sticky proteins now your body can make these or you can consume them in certain foods so if you took like barbecued ribs for example where they are cooking this sugar with meat or even ice cream where you have a lot of sugar you have the milk protein and fat all cooked up that and this will basically add more oxidation accelerate the aging process create a lot of sticky proteins that get stuck in your arteries your brain your eyes and it creates a lot of other issues benfotiamine can also decrease your a1c as well now the main way that I used it when I was in practice is for peripheral neuropathy and that breakdown the nervous system in your feet or your fingertips so you might have pain in your feet or numbness or burning pain making you difficult to walk this stuff works like magic you want to take at least 600 milligrams per day and you can spread it out I don have any specific benfotiamine to recommend you own research to find something that maybe has some good reviews but if you this will work like magic so it good for restoring nerve function it good for pain it neuropathies and it protect the brain against diabetic complications because a lot of times a diabetic will have dementia to have memory loss I mean type 3 diabetes is Alzheimer condition greatly now as far as the eyes go there complications from diabetes concerning the eye and one is damage to the retina well guess what the retina is all nerve tissue so benfotiamine is really good for the retina to protect against damage it kidney cell called a nephron so if someone has kidney damage let have stage three or four even five this is something I would highly recommend then we have the heart in the heart vessels there inside of the artery called the epithelial layer and the microvascular the tiny little blood vessels that innervate that can be protected when you take benefit Amin in fact if you deficient in B one of Miss important antioxidant and you can develop damage dysfunction and then guess what cholesterol builds up calcium builds up and you start getting plaque in the arteries so benfotiamine is very very important in cardiovascular function and act to protect the arteries and of course I regular viewer because if you also gonna recommend healthy keto okay and in a minute fasting as the basic diet that you need to do in addition to this because if you without correcting the diet it might not work as well I put a link down below for more information about that thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
The Reason Why Protein Is Used for Fat Burning Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGZZESrXSgw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so in this video we about protein there is so many confusions about protein and also should I have this amount or that amount or should I be a vegetarian uh so I to clear up some uh common misconceptions about protein um one of the princip principles behind uh any diet is to you want to trigger fat burning right you want to lose weight uh if we look at the Viewpoint of what hormones trigger fat burning and what foods trigger those hormones protein comes up very at the top of the list so protein does trigger the fat burning hormones okay but you have to understand what is a protein because in nature very few things come in pure proteins they always a combination of proteins carbohydrates and fats and if you basing your diet on a calorie counting model which by the way is incorrect you fat calories and avoiding those since they have the most calories you going to be looking at the protein uh part of this okay so that misconception and your entire diet is going to be wrong or if you at maybe the Atkins diet and you focused on protein and realize there six other types of foods that trigger fat brating process but they protein then you of the other pieces of the puzzle puzzle especially as it relates to the liver function because the more um the liver is damaged the more the liver is dysfunctional the older you get uh the less the liver can function the less protein you can digest so if you start increasing too much protein it to throw off something else and also if the liver is not good you to be able to have the thyroid work because the thyroid Works through the liver as well so anyway let about protein and some of the misconceptions let people that say well I protein I take a look nuts only have 15% Protein that not going to be triggering a lot of fat burning with nuts and then it has 133% carbohydrates so that those carbohydrates aren high sugar carbohydrates they don in Sugar very fast unless you have maybe cashews um but for the most part they don they they are high in fat but now when we burning process fat is neutral so in other words we don worry about fats if you want to burn fat through the hormone system but we do have to worry about fats in relationship to what it does to the liver so too much fat can irritate and clog up the liver and that eat nuts high in fat it irritates the gallbladder so the way we counter that is we um we increase the greens the vegetables to keep the liver healthy so as long as you in the diet about six to seven cups a day you can pretty much get away with fat and that includes even bacon and things like that so that counter it but if you um are only eating fat and protein that can aggravate the liver so what we want to do is we want to keep the carbs relatively on the low side but I I the sugar fast so even though vegetables are almost all carbohydrate they in fiber and they and they don insoluble fibers so they don turn into sugar on the other hand grains are very high in carbs but they different than vegetable because they turn into sugar very very fast okay so we want to we want uh in a food that has a bit higher amounts of protein a bit low carb or carbs that don down in the sugar very easily and we really don we content very high to flush things out of the liver all right so this whole conception of high calorie high fat turning into fat just take that and just put it over here because that really doesn thing that really makes you get fat so and I know people are it they like oh my gosh I have to avoid all fat well how does that work enough for you does it work I mean try it you cut your fats out it never really turns into weight loss it it also have another Factor here called nutrients because what we want to do is we want something high in nutrients so let oatmeal for breakfast is like eating cardboard it yes it has some factors that help lower cholesterol a little bit but as far as nutrients it with hummus hummus is a great food but it you the health if you have oatmeal or um hummus don they not hurt you but they might not help you again like eating cardor it to kill you but it you so nuts okay so nuts do have some good amount of nutrients okay so we have that now beans have 23% protein a bit more than nuts but look at the carb 72% versus 13% so this is going to get you right here those carbs now I against beans um and look at how low they are in fat but they do have a bit um a bit too many carbs to if you trying to lose weight now there to this problem so it simple as calories in equals calories out or high protein or low fat you have there complexities and I simple but one layer is this um beans are cooked so you destroy enzymes and then you destroy nutrition so you product and also even though they have higher protein than nuts they in fat and also most uh vegetarian programs say or um low lowfat diets say oh yeah beans are great because they such low in fat and low in calorie and they burn off these calories but a lot of these carbohydrates especially refined beans well those that pretty fast and black beans it not going to help your weight loss so we have this food and then we have your body interaction with it hormonally if your metabolism is low and that another variable if you consume some of these Foods too high in carb it create an effect on your metabolism in fact it your metabolism is high you can get away with all these carbs but and most people especially if they reach the age of 40 or 50 you away with these higher carbohydrate Foods um so even though you might walk it off in a mile the insulin response the sugar response uh could last far more than that mile it could last two three 4 days okay so what you have to know is just a little bit of the wrong thing can nullify a lot of good things all right so hope I I probably am but let through this so nuts high in fat but that high because it beans uh most of them are obvious cooked you the nutrition is not as high with beans but it metabolism is good if you lose weight uh you beans might not help you lose weight um and then we have hummus again uh look at 11% protein 45% carbs 44% fat okay all right not too bad um it going to turn into the sugar that bad because there fiber um but it because the nutrition is not very high so it something to keep you going but it necessarily going to help you burn fat but it you to gain weight either so this is a neutral food now let yogurt and cheese now yogurt has 36% Protein that good amount of protein and then also cheese has a little higher protein um but it also uh depending on what type of cheese that you consume because the the more aged it is uh the higher protein content and the less carbohydrate because those enzymes or those bacteria in the cheese that make these fermented products like yogurt kefir and cheese especially tend to um eat up some of the lactose the milk sugar in there reducing the sugar so now we have all these beneficial bacteria we got great protein and we have some fat as well especially if it concerned about the fat because we adding our vegetables are very very high so yogurt might help us but look at it does have 29% sugar I that is a bit high so if you to lose weight you may find that yogurt might slow you down a little bit but depends on your metabolism okay if your metabolism is slow you might have to eliminate all these high carb things definitely beans definitely hummus and definitely yogurt you could probably get by with cheese though because cheese is not very high in carb okay but yogurt and Kefir is um but but nuts would be okay because look at how low that would be 133% now let grains have 15% protein that is like very very low and look at how much carb it carb it this is like turning in the sugar very very fast so grains are very very bad for weight loss yet they low they are in fats so all these lowfat diet so-called gurus will say it to consume grains because it low in fat and have complex carbohydrates and have whole grain not refined grain or white bread well it doesn in the sugar faster than sugar some of these sugars turn affect your blood sugars and U there you can Wheat Belly that talks about how whole grain is very very bad advice so when you consuming a diet um a balanced diet the food pyramid diet um and you have a fat situation stubborn belly fat or whatever you you can can have you know balanc proteins carbohydrates and fats why because your body is out of balance so you really have to force your body to burn fat by reducing these carbs as far down to zero as possible okay especially the ones that turn the sugar so grains will just block any chance of losing weight and that also includes some fruit as well so we going to keep fruit down as well um so we have grains we have low fat but it can eat you can have all these great foods but just add grains well that enough to block any chance of losing weight and plus there of nutrition in grains now yogurt there there little bit higher okay but grains are low grains are out okay uh fish look at this 93% protein oh my goodness that is a very good fat burner and look at how many carbohydrates zero huge ability to burn fat but again the principle there layers of complexity you have also um too much protein so you wouldn necessarily live on protein or have like 12 O per meal because that can also bog down the liver all the fat burning hormones that come through the body go through the liver so we need to keep that liver opened up and healthy and then if we consume a lot of vegetables because if you don burning ends up in the liver and it gets stuck in the liver and you end up with a fatty liver that diet people or the high protein diet people end up with the fatty liver and that toxic and um so we want um to understand the whole picture so fish look at this 7% fat I mean that your liver and people always say what the best proteins for for the body well we what would be the best protein to to lessen the stress on your liver fish would be great Seafood would be even better so those are very low liver stress uh proteins now animal protein 59% Protein that but look at 0% carb so animal protein will also help you burn fat but look at how much higher it is in fat so again if you better enhance the vegetables to clean out that fat but you know what you could probably get away with if you were to consume Just Fish because this is low in protein I much can get away with um eating mostly fish if there through the day because it to put stress on your liver or your pancreas it fat burning and then there types of fish too like hbit is higher in fat this is cod cod is low in fat but of course it good all right so now we have kale 16% protein wow that more than nuts it it protein in cow what do you know but look at how high it is in carbohydrate 72% but none of this just turns in the sugar very fast so it it fibers so your digestion is going to um um not break that down into direct sugar so um it takes a lot of energy to break that down so you of like you just break it this stuff down and then of course 15% fat but these are healthy fats these are omega-3 fats Omega 6 fats so it pretty low in fat and so it is you can see it so we have the perfect food right here kale all right now look at eggs 29% protein you would think that would be higher in protein but it in protein but it protein very low in carbon so eggs also are going to help you lose weight because look at that carb is only 2% and we have a lot of nutrition as well but it are fine but they could stress the liver a little bit if you vegetable all right so I hope I clarified some of the confusions about protein you might want to watch this several times take some notes um so apply the information and we will see you in the next video	Success

Why Did the Ketogenic Diet Spike My Pulse Rate?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnEWrONMhBk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I wanted to create this quick video on a question someone had why did Kiko spike my heart rate so let this normally if your pulse rate is higher it potassium and that could come from eating too much sugar or actually taking too much salt which indirectly lowers the potassium because potassium Calmes the heart down or let taking diuretics that could deplete your potassium or you vegetables so potassium is like the most important thing for regulation of heart rate the other thing is if you deficient in potassium it can cause the heart to work harder and it can make a pounding sound you can even hear it in your ear and that usually comes from consuming a lot of carbohydrates or sugar something like that so this could be the reason why your heart rate is low and then you just want to take electrolyte powder you consume more vegetables stop the sugar you could consume more salt as you have more potassium but if you have low potassium you don because you want to look at the ratio those ratios are actually more important than even the total amounts and of course the diuretics you have to get with your doctor on that point the next reason is you have low vitamin b1 because you or grains or you depletes b1 by the way in which case you need to take nutritional yeast and that should bring the heart rate down there one less thing the gallbladder when you start keto you are not used to that many fats and you can create pressure in the organs and congestion and actually indirectly put pressure on the heart which can speed up the pulse rate these two are not the issue then what you do is you want to cut down on some of the fats especially MCT oil the little keto bombs and any extra types of fats that you consuming just cut that down a little bit and that should help you one other thing you can do is you can actually massage the little bile ducts around that area I put a link down below on it not actually fleshing out the gallbladder but you releasing the pressure that you can do as well if you feel a lot of bloating especially after eating alright thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
What Causes Fatigue? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeCwH6vzjzc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	one of the biggest problems in healthcare is the lack of evaluation so evaluation is finding the root cause of something it true thing that caused something so I going to take in this video Just One symptom and pull the string and show you what I do because every time you treat a symptom you camouflage the symptom and you perpetuate the problem all right let we a clue and go deeper now the first thing I do is I find out when did it start and then what happened just before you start getting tired to get a clue to find out what situations with sleeping I fatigue number one is you sleeping and you sleeping but you guess one of the biggest causes of fatigue is you that so we don want to treat this with 5our energy drink or treat this with a sleeping pill we want to find out what it so I potential causes of not sleeping number one it could be stress it could be your adrenals are burnt out and you in stress because you pushing pushing it could be that you stopped smoking 20 years ago and you were so dependent on the nicotine that the stopping of smoking created stress in the heart because nicotine are artificially opened up the coronary artery to the heart and then you actually relaxed and you actually can breathe better so when you smoke for many years and you stop you could actually have a problem with your heart being tired because it adapted so I have a lot of people that when they stop smoking after that they were just stuck in stress and they were tired and they couldn that one point okay so it could be a physical reason maybe you have pain in your back maybe you have a pain in your neck and you can high flash that could be it too or maybe it Apnea right and they La label and then they treat it but what causes the sinus let causes sinus well what causes the thicken mucous membranes could be a lack of vitamin A right we could have lack of vitamin A but it could be you don bile from your gallbladder to digest the vitamin A and that absorbing it from the food that you eating and by the way kale Shake is high in vitamin A and that sinosis or it could be the adrenals are so stressed that um that high level of cortisol could cause atrophy of certain nerves in the back of the neck that go to the mucus membranes and swell swell up to sinuses so a lot of people with adrenal problems end up with sinus problems because the treatment for sinuses are a lot of times steroids because steroids are adrenal hormones so that be allergies but again what causes allergies a weak adrenal so we trying to pull a string it could be a nutritional Factor it could be low vitamin could be low um potassium all right because maybe your diet enough in pottassium because you eating enough vegetables or it could be too much sugar that potassium so we got to look at both angles could be lack of calcium because maybe you and you junk Foods deete depletes calcium and B vitam so a lot of breads pasta cereal crackers biscuits and waffles and pancakes can deplete the B vitamins that are supposed to be retained in the body and ending up with a low Vitamin B and then what happens is that you basically you have nightmares and you can so B vitamins help you sleep could be junk food it could be alcohol you know these are just factors that I looking at it could be environmental where your bed is just not flat enough and it kind of sags and you need a new bed or it could be noise because your husband snores or what about your dog do you sleep with your dog some patients sleep with their dog I going to work because the dog fidgeting all night long or maybe you work third shift okay another causation or maybe you of sleep so these are things that we have to pull a string and find out what example you are sleeping and you still tired that could be a thyroid problem why we got to find out why it could be high estrogen levels be coming from a period a fibroid maybe you eating too much soy in your diet or you just got pregnant and you spiked the estrogen and then the thyroid became a problem and then you couldn things that you want to dig deeper it could also be a liver did you realize that your thyroid is dependent on the liver and it converts the thyroid hormones through the gallbladder so without a good liver or a good gallbladder if you had it removed you can there there thereby creating a fatigue in your body so these are things that are deeper than the superficial or it could be a virus that comes out of remission so anytime the immune system goes down because of stress you know a loss of a loved one boom immune system goes down and you get sick old viruses can come outter Mission and it could make you tired uh I have people that are in chronic uh like mono um which is epsteam bar virus and they tired because of because of the low adrenal because they environment I because they had an old head injury and ever since that injury they tired in their head okay it could be also the our light sleeper because the adrenals are so stressed out your body can can deeper levels so number One never accept um a symptom as being a problem okay differentiate symptoms from problems cause and effect and always ask why and that way you can really get to the bottom of it I hope this helped I see you in the next video	Success
Vitamin K2 and Pathological Calcification	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW7iBvPuDM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hi I vitamin k2 and something called pathological calcification okay now what is pathological calcification this is a condition in your body where calcium is developing in the wrong places it usually involved in plaquing in the arteries it could also be the calcification of part of your stomach kidney as in kidney stones or even calcification in Pawleys cystic kidney disease it could also be calcification in your lungs there tissue calcification of the cornea of the eye so it involved in certain disease states now there condition but I just wanted to give you some of the basics so we have this calcium that is developing in the soft tissues of the body not in the bone this calcium could be developing as a need to act like a band-aid because there oxidation in the vascular system or a certain part of the body and let you don protect that oxidative lesion or selenium which is a very powerful antioxidant involved with glutathione which is the main antioxidant of the liver then you have the added ischemia which is a lack of blood flow that combination of low nutrients damage to the tissues low blood flow calcium will tend to invade and start to actually heal the area at the expense of clogging an artery now the other interesting thing about this is calcium will tend to accumulate in certain parts of the body and involving the control of pH like the kidneys like this stomach so the stomach makes hydrochloric acid and if you not making enough hydrochloric acid and that stomach tissue becomes a little too alkaline you because of that then you have nano bacteria which is the smallest known bacteria they these little microbes that hide in these little calcium shells or a little egg loose to protect themselves as a survival mechanism almost impossible to kill with antibiotics and they many diseases that have calcification connected to it like periodontal disease or calcification the arteries or even kidney stones sometimes gall stones and just as a side note if you suspect a nano bacteria because you have calcification in any of these locations I would recommend taking folic acid and something called EDTA this is the natural key later now let me just shift gears to vitamin k2 vitamin k1 has everything to do with clotting okay preventing bleeding vitamin k2 is completely different it about 17 different proteins involving the movement of calcium out of the soft tissue back into the bone out of the soft tissue into the teeth for example now there are other functions too for example one being involved in the mitochondria and this is one of the reasons why if they have enough vitamin k2 they have a lot of energy I personally notice when I take vitamin k2 I has a lot to do with building up the mitochondria especially with skeletal muscle and providing endurance so vitamin k2 has about stopping some type of bleeding going on the body vitamin k2 is the transportation of calcium and then comes up the question is vitamin k2 a common vitamin deficiency and the answer is yes absolutely many people are deficient in vitamin k2 and it could be for various reasons but vitamin k2 is in organ meats it butter it goose liver so if you diet you may be deficient now it in fermented soybeans for example there America very few people consume fermented soybeans as NATO unless you live in Japan you to consume that on a regular basis but if you did you would get vitamin k2 now you could take it from a supplement and get vitamin k2 very easily but I just wanted to point out it was discovered in 1994 that if you deficient the body will convert to vitamin k2 and in 1998 it was discovered that vitamin k1 could convert to vitamin k2 without the bacteria like in your flora because your microbes make vitamins definitely vitamin k1 but even without this bacteria you can actually make some k2 now here also deficient in vitamin k1 what are the common vitamin k1 foods the leafy greens so for those people who don consume enough greens or foods that have k2 they are going to be deficient now I also want to mention that antibiotics will deplete vitamin k2 a low-fat diet could be the reason why you have a low vitamin k2 of course if you consuming the fermented soy nado if you reason why you have low vitamin k2 mineral oil will deplete vitamin k2 GI tract issues irritable bowel syndrome celiac can cause malabsorption and lower your k2 and if you have liver damage let could also be the reason why you have low vitamin k2 and there important point that professor Bruce Ames developed something called a triage theory and that theory goes like this if you the subclinical vitamin deficiency and let have some of the vitamin but you don have the full required amount the body will then ration out what it has only for those actions involving short-term survival and it will not allocate that nutrient for all of the functions that don when we talk about vitamin k1 and let say you had a subclinical deficiency of vitamin k1 which means you didn enough of it the body allocate that to coagulation first which is going to involve the stopping of any type of broken blood vessels or bleeding internally before any is Alec to the calcium removal and I really think this right here is the reason why so many people have calcium building up in the wrong place simply because they either don convert to k2 or they enough of the k2 or they antibiotics or they might be in statins or they have digestive issues or a fatty liver those are the more common reasons why we have this problem it can also be a low vitamin E combined with adding a lot of sugar to your diet and high carbs which create the oxidation in the first place which then can even make you susceptible to certain types of bacteria which make things worse so in summary if you have calcification what you need to do is take some of this some of this right here make sure you start taking vitamin k2 because if you get this from food probably is not going to be enough you want to take larger quantities to start actually reversing some of this damage right here and I would definitely start beefing up no pun intended vitamin k1 by consuming more leafy greens and if you don symptoms of any type of calcium buildup as a preventative measure I would do healthy Kido which is large amounts of greens healthy fats to get your k2 and your gonna be totally bulletproof thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how

5 Things that Make You Susceptible to an Infection	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2LnwX7BG9I	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so the question we want to answer today is why are some people very susceptible to getting infections and other people are immune from infections I was flying somewhere this last weekend and I sitting in this plane and the person right behind me is just coughing and hacking and the lady next to me has a scarf around her mouth and I there trying not to breathe the air in this plane it was disgusting and I had no symptoms at all but you always think that wow I wonder if I because I and bacteria in this very small space you never know but let me just define this word susceptible likely or liable to be influenced or harmed by a particular thing and we viruses and bacteria and microbes what are the key things that make you liable to be influenced by a microbe well the first thing you need to know is that there system you have the innate part and you have the adapted part of the immune system now the innate is something you with it immune system it already has a pre-programmed function and I neutrophils monocytes and natural killer cells but the Adapted is very different when you system developed yet and it of t-cells and b-cells this system requires education and training so as soon as you start being exposed to the environment whether it a virus or a bacteria your body starts reacting and learning and developing a memory so the next time you to it your immune system knows exactly what to do this system is always trying to differentiate between your own cells and not kill your own cells off and only focus on the invader microbes and of course certain people in certain times of their life start having this system broken down where they can differentiate and they start getting self attack or autoimmune diseases there are five main things that make you susceptible to getting infections at the top of the list it interesting research on bereavement which is the condition that someone grieving over a loss of a loved one and they found that your immune system is suppressed neutrophils okay white blood cells are actually suppressed and when your immune system is suppressed it leaves the back door open to have this microbe invade and create damage part of this is controlled by the flight-or-fight sympathetic nervous system the other part is controlled by cortisol cortisol is one of the main stress hormones produced by the adrenal gland cortisol suppresses white blood cells so anytime cortisol is elevated you are susceptible to getting an infection now if you have a chronic stress over a long period of time cortisol tends to go down and now you don force for these hyper immune reactions so you can also have problems with the immune system with low cortisol as in a condition called Addison usually always sick with viruses just as much as having high cortisol and there a condition called Cushing which involves high cortisol so both can create this susceptibility to this microbe I mean when you think about people getting sick many times it happens after a stress event then we get into low vitamin D levels okay vitamin D is probably one of the most important vitamins to protect your immune system simply because it modulates or controls both the innate and the adaptive part of the immune system so if you are deficient in vitamin D both of these are not going to work and you to have the defense mechanisms in place and this is really why people get the flu in the fall and they get sick in the winter it vitamin D it rain it always recommend taking vitamin D through the winter months and their in the summer get more Sun then we get to zinc very important in immune protection if you your risk for getting strep especially strep in your lungs goes way up also you can as well zinc is present in certain white blood cells that help kill bacteria and by the way one billion people on this planet are deficient in zinc all right number four vitamin A very important in the mucous lining of your sinuses of a respiratory area of your throat vitamin A is involved in the protective layer on the inside of the body so if you deficient in vitamin A your risk factors go up for getting infections in the lung and by the way I forgot to say this when you your risk factor for viruses of the lung go way way up but if you vitamin A you that kill bacteria and clean up bacteria out of the system are suppressed and it just so happens that there is something that has a nice equal amount of vitamin A and vitamin D and you guessed it it cod liver oil something that your grandmother probably recommended growing up okay then we have vitamin C essential for your immune system and to protect you against microbes not having enough vitamin C makes you very susceptible the phagocytes don buildup of bacteria you can antibodies as well anymore so overall in summary these are the five things involved in susceptibility to getting infections so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
How to Deal With Ringworm Naturally	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOBGrw_EUTk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	had a question recently from someone that wanted to know what to do naturally for ringworm so I wanted to create this very short video there different types of fungus that can cause ringworm and it presents us this small red circle rash that kind of itchy and you can get it anywhere in the body men tend to have it in their groin area kids actually usually get it in their scalp but one of the most common ways that you acquire the ringworm is to your dog dogs are a reservoir of microbes that they bring in from the outside to the inside so sometimes you have to be careful where the dog is kissing you so simply there you take garlic oil two drops and you can either put it in a tablespoon of olive oil or coconut oil and apply it to the skin on a daily basis for about three or four days it should completely go away you can also use zinc cream you can also put tea tree oil in the coconut oil that works as well alright thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
CT Scan (CAT Scan) versus MRI: How They Differ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AAYMpsF3k	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I wanted to do this quick video to differentiate between a cat scan and an MRI so cat scan stands for computerized tomography and MRI is magnetic resonance imaging now the real big difference is the cat scan uses x-ray radiation which is ionized radiation and that is the big problem with cat scans because one cat scan would be equivalent to roughly around 200 chest x-rays and the MRI uses radio waves in magnets and they bounce around different tissues and create this a very detailed image an MRI is more detailed than a cat scan MRI is good for joints brain breasts evaluations blood vessels discs organs great for torn ligaments cat scans are good for bone fractures tumors monitoring cancer over time internal bleeding and it faster than MRI the problem of cat scans as many people have to get follow-up cat scans so you quadrupling this much radiation and that DNA so personally if I had a choice I would go for an MRI if they recommended a cat scan I would have to have a very good reason to do that and I would also try to get an ultrasound first and if I absolutely had to get a cat scan I would increase the amount of niacin to the diet I would do some prolonged fasting before and after the cat scan as well as consume a good amount of cruciferous vegetables just to counter some of the damage at the DNA level alright guys there you have it that would be the differences between these two tests so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success

Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C6zoIgraWs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	in this video we the real cause of headaches in migraines this is very important and very valuable because this video is actually worth $31 billion and that that year it of headaches you unknown cause it very mysterious and uh it coming from anxiety or depression that actually not the case the cause of headaches is very simple when you look at the whole body I think the confusion is when people get pain in their head they think the problem is in your head headaches are does not the source of headaches do not come from your head usually maybe 1% of the time so one of the first things you want to do with a headache or a migraine and by the way a migraine is just the more severe headache where it can involve sensitivity to light nauseousness and vomiting all right get a hisory find out is there any patternn involved in these headaches maybe it because of the pressure well that pretty no-brainer then this would be the cause or maybe it menstrual period which every month you get a headache we just isolated the root cause or maybe it was after an injury or after you drank alcohol last night and had a hangover or when you stopped drinking caffeine and you got caffeine withdraws or maybe it was an allergy so you want to get a history to get a CL of what of all headaches are coming from the gallbladder all right if you don believe me and you have a headache right now all you have to do is take your hands and press over the gallbladder which is right down here underneath the right rib cage and just press in and go in a little bit at this angle and hold this for 2 minutes if your headaches clear up then we know it and this is food related it when you eat too many nuts or peanut butter when you try to eat healthier that will trigger the gallbladder a lot of times it could be junk food or fatty foods but that gallbladder triggers a nerve right underneath your diaphragm that right up through to the right shoulder and up to the head and also the gallbladder Meridian in Chinese medicine goes all the way up to the top of your head all the way through here but it also goes on the left side too depending on if you have a digestive issue so 9 % of the time it related and you just need to change your eating 5% of the time it coming from a nerve pinch in your neck of course when you go to the chiropractor when you get adjusted and align that neck and he it goes away we know it let over and over then we know there other cause um I personally had headaches for 12 years and I didn what they were until I found out out it was my gallbladder it wasn because I had probably thousand adjustments and it just kept coming back over and over and over and over so when you try to solve the wrong problem and it keeps coming back then we have the wrong problem okay 2% of the time it the sinuses right well that easy because you have a sinus congestion it could be back into the the staan tubes back in the back of the throat up to the ears and that pressure will definitely cause a headache and um then you would just want to do things to help your sinuses like to recommend the the kale Shake in the morning because of the high vitamin A you can go to my website and download the recipe also you can do consume radishes radishes are really good to pull mucus out of the body and the sinuses and that will clear up the sinuses um and then we have the menstrual cycle so if you get a headache that time of the month then we need to support the ovaries with some type of natural remedy to help the headaches only 1% of the time is a it going to be coming from these things right here from an old injury to the head that could be the source of a headache um a tumor which is very very rare and of course if youve exhausted all the most common ones then you can actually get some testing to see is it really a headache the problem is I had people I come in and they thousands of dollars with testing when this is so rare to look for a tumor and they never found anything it waste of money if you do something very simple and you rule out the cause of it you saved a lot of money okay infection menitis if you have a fever and you feel tired it could be an infection causing your headaches don that reaction on on your body and it could be an allergy to something it could be a food allergy I headaches after eating gluten which is the protein and wheat or maybe milk or some other allergy that can be causing triggering the headache so that going to be food related or it could be envir seasonal uh related um caffeine withdrawal we talked about that or a hangover so that of most common to least uh common causes of headaches I hope this helped if it helped you please make a comment below on this video and I next video	Success
The Minnesota Starvation Experiment	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihSOwWNyHmU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	there done called the Minnesota starvation experiment it was in 1944 by a man named Ancel keys the same guy who fudged the data on the heart study in 1958 which has led to the false information about cholesterol causing heart disease that the same guy who did this experiment what Ancel Keys did in the heart study is he omitted data because he only gave you the data that aligned with his premise okay that cholesterol is bad in a clog the arteries he omitted a lot of other countries that showed no relationship between the cholesterol and heart disease and that classic example how certain researchers can manipulate data to look a certain way now with this experiment it involved over 36 men over a course of a year and the first three months they consumed 3,200 calories okay then after that they cut the calories down by half to about fifteen hundred and sixty calories for six months and this was called a semi starvation okay now to me that necessarily starvation because you could live on this if there are nutrient-dense foods but they wanted to mimic the diet that was in the war previous to that so they fed the potatoes rutabagas turnips bread and macaroni now I see ralph the bat there definitely not enough essential fatty acids and there vitamins or minerals in this diet over six months it serious nutritional deficiencies it not the starvation of the calories that I see is the problem it of the nutrients then after the six months they put them on a restricted Rehab period and they beefed up the calories to 2,000 to 3,200 okay where they fed them more protein more vitamins and so now they were feeling better and then after that they put them on an unrestricted rehab period for short of time where they pretty much can eat whatever they want but here outcome they were exhausted irritable bored cold this would be a thyroid problem okay because you nutrients we other videos decreased libido craving food like crazy they even resorted to stealing food okay and as the icing on the cake it destroyed their metabolism kind of metabolism went way way down and this is very similar to some of the diets that are out there that people go on which are low-calorie diets when you healthy keto plan and you minute fasting your energy goes up okay especially if you you your moods gonna come way up and you probably gonna find that your libido goes up you hunger goes away you going to end up stealing food because you and your metabolism is going to be fine so that is the benefit and the unique distinction between healthy keto and fasting versus a semi-starvation typical low calorie diet that a lot of people actually go on which they don really pay attention to the quality of food so I put a link down below for the actual study but I want to just point this out because many people that do fasting do not do healthy keto okay and they end up with problems and it totally unnecessary so what we can learn from this is the importance of nutrient-dense foods and all of the side effects that we can prevent and also if we the last thing we want to do is destroy the metabolism thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success

What Causes Endometriosis?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcLnosYVl9U	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let endometriosis very simply it endometrial tissue outside the uterus all right well what is a no material tissue and Demetrio tissue is composed of partially glandular in partly connective tissue that also has immune properties and this is why one of the biggest symptoms with endometriosis is chronic inflammation pain in the pelvis pain internally it also affects your menstrual cycle causes infertility painful intercourse and the list goes on and on now the big clue with endometriosis is this right here part glandular tissue which means that tissue is highly sensitive to hormones primarily estrogen and this is why women who have estrogen dominance have a higher risk of getting this condition now let potential causes of this problem starting at the most obvious something that you would expose that part of the body to on a routine basis and I talking about a tampon well you might say that that can natural cotton did you realize that 94% of all cotton grown in the u.s. is GML and the type of GMOs that they in cotton are the bt version which basically makes the cotton and insecticide so you could only imagine what can happen when you expose your body to something that acts as an exact aside and this is number one and of course if you tampons I would recommend only using organic tampons now if you might say well I don about that well did you realize that they feed a GMO cotton to cattle so these animals are consuming some of this cotton and the byproducts of that could end up on your plate unless you do organic beef grass-fed if you doesn non-organic because they may do grain finishing for four months after the grass-fed period of regular GMO grains so you definitely want organic and if possible you want to do your meats grass-fed grass-finished very important the next most important thing to avoid would be dairy products why because dairy is meant to grow calves and so milk is composed of a lot of growth hormones and we already have a growth of an abnormal tissue so we don add more growth factors to your diet to potentially create problem with this so I would go dairy free if you have this condition or if your estrogen dominance and one point I want to mention is that chemicals like insecticides and herbicides pesticides fungicides mimic estrogen in the body and that is a problem and this is also why grain fed animal products okay grains I mostly GMO like soy and corn are fed to the animals and if it you called glyphosate so the glyphosate is also going to go into the dairy and it can have an effect of estrogen in the body and then we get soy okay soy is also estrogenic especially soy protein isolates soy oils so I would definitely avoid a soy products and then we go into GMO foods the problem is trying to identify them at the grocery store because they don GMO but if you do organic you we get grains grains are highly inflammatory not to mention usually they all grains your blood Sugar better your inflammation will get better and then we get sugar now a lot of the sugar used in the u.s. is not from cane it from beet sugar which is mostly GMO so as you can see we a lot of chemicals indirectly from things that you might not even connect to being a chemical so this is what I would recommend go organic I would also consume a natural vitamin C complex and a vitamin E complex including the tocotrienols and the taka Fross the reason is because there really interesting research on animals not humans but still the data shows an improvement in endometriosis using vitamin C and vitamin E I down below so it potentially can help especially with the inflammatory conditions and the effect that these antioxidants have to soak up some of the free radicals that is another key mineral to help isn oxidant it anti-inflammatory and then of course omega-3 fatty acids are also really good to help reduce inflammation now there one last point there body called aromatase which converts testosterone into estrogen this can happen in men and women and so some of your estrogen which is creating the dominant situation could be coming from testosterone and so one good alternative to that would be to take an aromatase inhibitor and stinging nettle root is one of the best ones so if you were to take this as a supplement it probably would help you alright so that summary and my recommendations for endometriosis so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
11 Causes of Achy Legs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyQc6dD6nko	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let of achy legs now it could be in one leg or the other leg or both legs so number one you have this condition called claudication as an intermittent claudication instrument it means it comes and goes it has to do with pain or achiness upon exertion so let example you climb up the stairs or you to exercise and your legs get really painful or achy what there vascular system and your lower legs it could be a thorough sclerotic plaquing but the bottom line is you out of oxygen to the lower extremity one essential thing to do about that is to get in a low carbohydrate diet also in a minute fasting is going to be beneficial and then start getting on an exercise program that is very very light but it consistent every day and you do that gradually over a period of time you slowly increasing it because when you do that you of more blood vessels to the area number two sciatica now the silac nerve is the longest nerve in the body it thumb and it originates from the lumbar vertebra and it nerve that goes in the back part of the buttocks down to the back of the leg so you could either have a pinch in your lower back from I don protrusion or something or you could have a pinch in the location of the buttocks by a muscle called the piriformis if it pinch that nerve and you can experience achiness in the lower part leg but realize this the static nerve is in the back part of leg not on the side of the leg if you have a kena sore pain on the side that could be another nerve but it much all of these I put videos down below to tell you what to do about them for this one you want to make sure that you want to work on the curve in the lower back to create that more space in the nerve roots okay number three restless leg syndrome and I have a video on this specifically but this is a buildup of lactic acid in muscles in your lower leg because you low in vitamin b1 okay and if you deficient in this because you too many carbohydrates you to be able to get rid of lactic acid so you lactic acidosis so it it should be and the muscles are gonna feel very restless I had this for many years I didn be getting up in the middle of night going for a jog in the middle of the night to try to get this energy out of my legs it just I could not relax very simply I wish I would have known this b1 nutritional yeast gets rid of it like that and of course cutting out the carbs I was doing a lot of carbs back then okay number four virus is like an Epstein bar virus can come in and out of remission over the years depending on your stress level and what activates it and that can create various symptoms fatigue achiness in the muscle or swollen lymph nodes okay number five low vitamin D why because vitamin D is one of the most powerful anti-inflammatories so if you gonna have more inflammation especially in the lower back but it can be anywhere in the body and it can also show up as a keenest not just pain number six if you have a pinched nerve in your back somewhere that can refer not just pain in the lower part of your legs but achiness as well number seven electrolyte imbalances so if you deficient in potassium or sodium or magnesium or even calcium that could be enough to create not just a cramp but an achiness in the calf or your foot or your buttocks muscle as well it could be any anywhere in the body number eight old injuries let fill in your tailbone okay you Jam the tailbone or you fell on the knee or you sprained an ankle or you stub to toe that can alter the biomechanics and cause you to walk a little bit out of balance and over the years that is gonna create wear and tear on certain joints especially the knee joint and and then it causes one muscle to tighten up and the other one who loose and create imbalances asymmetries that can cause a keenest pain and arthritis I have videos on what to do for old injuries especially if you fell on your tailbone or you sprained an ankle or you have knee pain so I put those down below number nine deep vein thrombosis this is a situation where you have a clot in the deeper veins of the legs and that now I talked about the clot right here okay but if you have a clot called a thrombus that that swelling one of your legs could be extra warm and you can have alteration in the color of the leg because it the circulation number 10 varicose veins or spider veins that is a problem with the superficial veins in your legs which could definitely create achiness okay so both of these can create a cleanness and then we have diabetes diabetes is a high blood sugar situation not only will it deplete mountain b1 but it will also create oxidation in the inside of the artery and the capillaries the small blood vessels that feed the nerves so you can have a keenest from the muscle aspect because the muscle is not getting oxygen but also a heinous from the neurological damage that occurs from having diabetes and I put videos on each one of these down below so you can check it out and there you have it 11 causes of achy legs thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create

Why Do I Get Sick When I Exercise?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5lShN1DmYo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I get sick when you exercise now some people they get sick if they over train or if they endurance type exercise like a triathlon they actually get the flu or they get a cold now there on this I put some links below but it has to do with the deficiency of l-glutamine it amino acid and it blood cell the leukocytes at very high levels it gut immune mucosal layer which is basically the barrier to your immune system so if you don l-glutamine and you you system will be suppressed and you have less ability to fight infections and this can also occur if you very deficient and you just do a little mild exercise I where as soon as you start working out you start getting like the flu symptoms you just need to take some l-glutamine and I would recommend take between five to ten grams per day and it the exercise that can exaggerate the need for glutamine it could also be a systemic inflammatory condition or a chronic infection which a lot of people have this and they don this or a post surgery or some type of trauma from a burn or an accident so just realize that there between your stress and immune system and this is the food that feeds the immune system to keep up with this increase demand on your body so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
The Underlying Root Cause Of Hair Loss Â Treatment For Hair Loss Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tumJRQ01Hmg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	Hey, it about hair loss. Okay, so there question from a lady that said, losing my hair and I need some help. So, we that. Um, when you loss, um, you have to make sure that you don loss, and that you have to find the cause of it. And hair loss is a symptom. So people are taking biotin and they with all these collagen and things and vitamins thinking that in the hair and do something. It a joke. It that. So in my book um I talk about in two different sections because there really uh three different situations going on with hair. uh one uh is actually in chapter seven uh on the thyroid body type. So the thyroid gland can cause thinning of the hair. Thinning brittle hair. Okay, that would be thyroid. But again, what causes the thyroid problem? That dig in there. I always like to use a question. When did it start? That gives the clue. What what happened just before it started? Did you get pregnant and then you lost your hair? Um did you start a diet and start losing your hair? For example, uh I had someone completely almost bald and it was after she did a high protein diet and all that protein was the wrong thing for her body type and that aggravated her liver. You have to have a good liver to digest all that protein. Well, anyway, one of the causes of thyroid is a liver problem. It blocked the liver. Boom. and the thyroid can all her hair. Now, I do a vegetarian diet after watching the documentary called I think it um forks over knives or something. Forks over knives I think it is um where they talk about u being a vegetarian. Well, they cut out all protein and lost all their hair. So, and they started breaking down their teeth. So really, you want to adjust the eating plan to your body type, not just do like you can point is that what can cause a thyroid problem usually is um a liver problem or a lack of bile, that detergent that dissol um that helps you break down the grease from your gallbladder. And if you bloating or you have constipation or you have a liver problem, um that alone can block the thyroid and cause the thinning. So do you want to work on the thyroid? No, you want to support your liver. Again, ask yourself, when did it start? What happened just before? Now, we have estrogen spike. Estrogen can also block the thyroid from a pregnancy, being on HRT, hormone replacement therapy, birth control pills, consuming lots of soy, all those things can spike estrogen and block your thyroid. Okay, so how do you know if you have high estrogen? Watch my video on high estrogen. Um it the symptoms are heavy period um a problem with your cycle um heavy weight on the lower part of your body fibroids that that would all indicate that you have too much estrogen. So these two two things can block the thyroid and cause thing of your hair. So that cause. The next thing we is receding hair um or male pattern baldness. Now that is a androgen problem. What is androgens? That male hormone. It testosterone and women have it too. And so when that hormone goes higher, what happens is it starts to burn out the hair follicles and it starts to recede or you start losing hair on the top part right here, men and women. Now, if this happens, if you getting receding hair, there causes to that. One is high levels of insulin. Okay? And that comes from sugar or refined carbs. Now, excess insulin can convert estrogen into androgens. And that ovarian syndrome, u PCOS, um they metformin because they have what called insulin resistance. Well, that because their their insulin has been too high and causing insulin resistance and triggering this effect. So again, this could cause that. All right, high levels of cortisol, that that do? Well, think about it. The adrenal gland makes three hormones on the outside of the adrenal gland. cortisol, which is a stress hormone, androgens, and then another hormone called eldoststerone. But we adrenal gland is overworking, like in sustained stress, it will raise all three of these hormones. And so, you going to have high androgens just from a overactive adrenal. And that will cause the receding hair. And a lot of times it goes from here to here or it you increase insulin, cortisol, or this other hormone called IGF, insulin like growth factor. I don just kind of give you the summary of what what this is. This is a hormone from your liver. And um you make it you make all three of these, but a lot of times when you consume the wrong foods, specifically soy protein isolates and diet foods, that will spike the IGF and create high levels of androgen, too. So in other words, it again. If something aggravates your liver, you can actually have high androgens and have receding hair. So again, we got to look at the different things that it could be. Could it be thyroid, liver? So, as you can see, so far, we got a lot of liver situations going on. Okay. But then this last one, you can have patches of your hair come out in different places. That alopecia. That where your body is attacking um your own hair root. So, it your own hair. Now, that usually comes from an overactive adrenal from a stress event. So, we So most stress events will cause autoimmune and that autoimmune conditions whether it rheumatoid arthritis, MS, alopecia, whatever is comes after a loss of a loved one or maybe uh some type of accident or an injury or sustained stress. So, if we really want to know the cause of stress, it of stress, sugar, eating the wrong things, soy protein isolates, the liver, or having too much estrogen in the diet, in the environment, or just having your body pump out too much because you have a fibroid. So, I have specific videos on all these. I just wanted to give you a summary on the general possible causes of hair loss. I hope this helps. So, if you want, just watch some of these specific videos through my blog and see if you can find out now what to do about it. All right, so this is Dr. Berg signing off and I video.	Success
How to Do a Garlic Nasal Rinse? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNM_NXwOkcQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	in this video I to do a garlic nasal rinse or a flush and it have a lot of congestion in their sinuses chronically Through The Years so you know you have seen seasonal allergies but you also have people that have always are always stuffy and that has to do with a fungus in their sinosis okay one of the best things to kill funguses and viruses are is basically garlic so I garlic nasal rinse very very simply this is what you going to take one garlic clove so it just going to be one of these little sections and don okay and you and you small little pieces and then you going to wait for 15 minutes okay then you waiting for 15 minutes you boil um a half a cup of of water let me just put pour a half a cup of water you to boil a half a cup of water and while you and then you all chopped up and put it in a little bit of a strainer right here so you going to put the garlic in there and then you cup like a coffee cup and pour the half a glass of hot boiling water over this garlic okay and it fluid that comes out into your cup so we temperature of that boiling water becomes lukewarm you maybe want to put in the refrigerator for a while to speed it up but do not flush your sinuses with pure garlic with in the water and boiling H that would be a problem okay you would really have a problem so don wait until it going to actually use a nety pot or this nasal rinse flush thing you can get these I guess at CVS or a netti pot but basically what you do is soon as this this fluid becomes um lukewarm you this plastic thing or a netti pot a nety pot it looks like a little teapot it the same deal you when it becomes lukewarm you put this in your nose and kind of flush it over the sink and you can you know watch a video on how that happens like because I going to demonstrate this but the instructions are there it do you the water and squeeze this or pour it as the water comes on the other nostril and all this garlic will go up into your sinuses and start to break down the fungus mold mildew viruses whatever is in their bacteria and you you and it the mucus membranes it would do that actually daily or every other day for a couple weeks if it the silenes clear up it natural remedy uh it funguses and just make sure that you do not put hot water too hot make sure it lukewarm and make sure that you do not have actual garlic chunks in the mixture okay so go ahead and try this and let me know how it works	Success
Flight or Fight Mechanism Explained In A Simple Way Â Autonomic Nervous System Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktQBLFabQXQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you know a lot of times uh when you go to the doctor and they do all these tests especially blood tests things don that those symptoms could be subclinical or below they might be not showing up a convential test yet because they symptoms of a of a condition that takes years to develop so there is a test that I do in my clinic um that sensitive and it picks up uh the beginning stages of different situations okay but in order to explain that I have to explain what it there autonomic nervous system ANS if you physiology you autonomic nervous system autonomic meaning kind of the involuntary automatic uh system that works on autopilot you don about breathing or your heart rate because it just automatically goes so this system is the system behind all other systems it system it it nervous system that regulates um on and off functions or hyper hypo so if you had a little light switch and you had a little real or a little dial that to turn up the light and down that would be what this system controls is the turning up and the turning down down of different organ and gland functions okay so there divisions one is called the sympathetic uh and that would be another name for that would be the flight or fight mechanism and that is the stress State it stress if there either run away or fight the lion uh if a car is on your child you would try to lift the car over the child and get this incredible adrenaline rush so the sympathetic nervous system kind of runs on a adaline and other hormones that activate or turn things on so if you can imagine in a certain stress State all the different body reactions that occur that would be controlled by that part right here okay so that switch now we also have the off switch uh which is called the parasympathetic and that has to do with more rest sleep and digestion so you can being chased by a tiger you can reproduce if you tiger so when body when these bodies are in stress States they have reproductive problems they have hormone problems they have digestive problems and they can sleep so this be considered the system that helps relax you and calm you down and so these things are constantly going back and forth so if you can imagine in a total relaxed State all the different body functions that healing that when your metabolism is working so this system measures all those functions okay so we go back and fourth so this would be more like the reaction to stress this is more the ability to recover from stress now what a test to measure both of these systems and it Russians in 1990 called the heart rate variability and there studies and even certain cardiologists use this as a predictor for mortality from cardiovascular incidents I don use that for that purpose I used it mainly to measure stress in the body so the heart rate variability uh technology will measure information between the heartbeats to assess the nervous system that functions of the heart and from there we can kind of get an idea what through the entire body okay so that what this test is and and I want to just explain the two scenarios um we can actually visualize what going on with stress in the body we can actually see stress in your body and see how it you this graph this line should be totally Plum up and down like there in the room the there walls are safe everything everything should be chilled out but when you measure someone a lot of times it body is reacting to stress but there no stress there so they kind of stuck in something in that state you might find them thinking a lot analyzing they can can they when they um a loss of that over time when you stuck in stress when you you end up burnt out and then this tall dial goes to the left and that would describe someone who kind of lost their Vitality they get up and go Mojo they um and be they feel like they they feel like they can what happens when this goes down here because now their body doesn stress anymore another physiological thing would be if they were to exercise and the pulse rate doesn so this does control the pulse rate okay now over here the parasympathetic it measured by a smaller dial right there so we measure that too and normally that needs to be all the way to the right okay okay because you should always have a little bit more of this than this because you it your buffer reserved to stress so if you you need to be able to have enough Reserve to get away and then recover from that so it you are done being chased by the tiger how fast does your body come back and recover how fast can you recover from stress how fast can you recover from exercise and if this brings the pulse rate up when you bring it down after you stop exercising okay if you work out and your ex your pulse rate stays high for a long period of time then you don system that can recover that that very unhealthy state so this is another system that measures um kind of like your ability to recover from stress and this is an active recovery so your body is constantly working to recover from stress so if there if this dial goes right here and the more it goes to the left your tolerance for stress is affected people get on your nerves easily you have no patience you don can severely affect your metabolism okay so those are the different um mechanisms and there is a test to measure these and it determining what exercise the person needs kind of where they body and then there that I do to extract the old stress from the body using acupressure to make a difference so I like 25 years so I the changes in this graph by doing before and afters so I hope this was helpful and um it system and then it variability	Success
3 Causes of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) & High Androgens Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz4V_oNoclY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	So, we condition called PCOS or PCOD. It polycystic ovarian syndrome or disorder. Okay. Now, we cause and effect. If you look this up, you causes. It unknown. It resistance. It blah. But let the cause and the root cause. Um the reason why it this is just because it named. Poly means many. Cystic means cyst. In reality, PCOS is not really cyst, it are eggs released by the ovary. So in other words, the ovary is producing too many follicles. So what happens? This should be really named poly follicular ovarian syndrome, but it here little sack around this egg um that makes androgens. And in the body, what normally supposed to happen, these androgens are supposed to be converted into estrogen, okay? By enzyme. And what happens if this enzyme is blocked in any shape or form, you buildup of androgens. So this entire kind of a pathway gets blocked. It kind of like um a chain of events that are supposed to occur. And if you block this chain right here, everything kind of backs up. So, it constipated because your your uh colon is blocked. You through the plumbing and through the liver. Well, this is what happens. High androgens come from the block of that enzyme. And if you look up um things that block this enzyme and if there any medical doctors or physicians, the name of this enzyme is called aromatase cytochrome P450, which basically also helps you detoxify toxic chemicals in the liver. So this specific chemical blocks the enzyme and causes high androgens. This chemical glyphosate is an herbicide. It Monsanto and it is called Roundup and it the GMO foods. So, if you want more data on that, watch my GMO video. But this chemical which is in so many foods, not just uh plant-based, but also animal based because animals are fed this GMO food, you this chemical right here, which will block this thing up and spike the energy. Not to mention that it also acts like a estrogen in the body, too. So you could have like a a problem with estrogen and androgens and that this has also been linked to tumors. Okay. Um in different parts of your body including your thyroid. So you can have all these mixed things. You can have acne uh receding hair uh facial hair a little goer a little nodule in your thyroid and you can have a mixed situation from these chemicals that are kind of um hidden in the background. So PCOS is high androgens. This is one cause a backup of androens because this is not converting because something is blocking it. Uh another cause would be um high insulin from eating too much sugar and then it level of what another video I did on blood sugars. You can watch that. But basically IGF is called insulin like growth factor which is a hormone made by the liver that helps you regulate sugars when you not eating. So insulin regulates sugars when you sugars when you when you have too much insulin, you this. And this is the one that converts to androgens. Okay? So that number two. Cause number three is not only does the ovary make androgen some in a female, but the adrenal also makes androgen too. So an overactive adrenal will produce more androgens from stress and that speaking, we have an excess of stress, an excess of sugar and GMO chemical foods is the root cause of this. Now it makes a lot of sense because we the most obvious standpoint, not some mysterious unknown cause. So, hope you enjoyed the video and I will see you in the next one.	Success
Clogged Arteries, Osteoporosis and Vitamin K2 Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gei4_8ZAvo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I wanted to create a video on clogged arteries osteoporosis and vitamin K2 you may have never heard of vitamin K2 but it K1 vitamin K1 helps clot things and even doctors if they want to thin the blood to prevent clots they drug called catin to thin the blood because it blocks vitamin K1 but vitamin K2 is very very very very different vitamin K2 works with vitamin D in calcium metabolism all right so let just show you how this works vitamin D3 has a function absorbing calcium so it actually what it does is it allows the calcium to be absorbed by 25 times more than it normally would so calcium doesn help by other vitamins okay vitamin D3 is is the one that works in the intestine and helps you absorb the calcium from the the intestine much greater than if you didn what calci What vitamin D does is it increases the amount of calcium in the in the blood now if you have too much vitamin D you can end up with too much calcium in the blood it calcemia um but the the vitamin K2 is the other part of the transportation because without vitamin K2 you end up with plaing calcium plaing in the artery you end up with all sorts of uh extra junk in the joints calcium uh on the teeth is tartter in the soft mainly in the soft tissues so vitamin K2 helps deliver that Gunk that calcium Gunk and the calcium that from the help of vitamin D3 into the bone so and the teeth so one of the purposes of vitamin K2 do make sure you have very very strong bones um with strong calcium and other minerals and good teeth but what vitamin K2 is the most potent inhibitor of vascular calcification you ever noticed when people get older they get stiffer and they start hunching over like this and they become almost like a stone that in vitamin K2 because calcium just kind of randomly plugs everything up vitamin K2 also has been shown to improve elasticity in your arteries now think about what that may do to your blood pressure too it may decrease the blood pressure because it arter is more elastic um there cardiologists now that have blogs out there recommending vitamin K2 for calcified aortic uh or which is like the vessel in your heart to help reverse that um but you research on that because it also helps clean out the joints and the te teeth the other effects is that it does have effects on the jaw bone and the maxillary bone and the teeth so without K2 you end up having kind of a narrow jaw uh dental problems a need of braces cavities things like that um they did three clinical trials and they did find that um they did not see any prevention of osteoporosis by taking calcium in females which is interesting because I know people tell you to take your calcium to BR osteoporosis but that absolutely not true because they the three big studies fail to show any positive relationship between taking calcium and preventing osteoporosis and that includes taking vitamin D and we know why because the person is deficient in vitamin K2 they also found that a side effect from taking this calcium is you start getting calcified arteries and heart problems even heart attacks so by taking calcium it can create problems but if you know about vitamin K2 then you understand why because they didn the the dump truck to deliver the calcium all the way over here now I did list down below what I recommend is how much dosage should take vitamin D3 and vitamin K2 because in order to make vitamin kt2 work it needs vitamin D3 so they both work together and in nature we always look at things as an isolated event but really it that occurs so the big question is this where do we get vitamin K2 from our Foods well you get it from the conversion of K1 to K2 because um K1 is in all the leafy greens it the grass it then converts it to vitamin K2 and it cheese butter from cows that have been fed grass not grains it Goose liver so people don they don yolks from chickens that have eaten some grass as well so what are the two things that people or doctors tell you to avoid for clogged arteries cholesterol eggs butter um cheese whole milk yogurt the exact things that have de K2 that would prevented the problem in the first place so okay so now it everyone knows and they tell you to do this right but you can take it as a supplement but you don necessarily be afraid to consume butter from a grass-fed cow or even egg yolks organic egg yolks or even what I like to do is I like to have the European cheeses and because those cheeses are from cows that are on a mountain um um that have fed grass they feeding grains mainly from Europe that pretty much what I do I consume a lot of cheese because I course but the point is that you can really help undo this and prevent osteoporosis if you get enough of the K2 and have the vitamin D3 and this is uh actually fascinating because it actually helps you reverse some of the aging process with the elasticity of your soft tissue the joints and and the arteries okay so this is very exciting so I hope you enjoyed the video and I see you in the next one	Success
Why is my Systolic Blood Pressure High?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jYjJo0MPVg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so why would your systolic pressure be higher than your diastolic well there a condition for that called isolated systolic hypertension normally the blood pressure is 120 over 80 that top number is the systolic which is the measurement of the contraction of the heart and the diastolic which is the relaxation phase so this condition is defined as the top number systolic going above 130 but sometimes you see it actually really high like 160 or 180 this is the most common type of hypertension over the age of 65 reported by the Mayo Clinic the question is what causes this well if you do Google researches you anemia hyperthyroid diabetes but you won into other references like this book right here which is the simple collection of medical illustrations volume 4 endocrine system page 86 and this is under the section of a condition where you have high cortisol I you cortisol may be responsible for the moderate hypertension which is characteristically more of the systolic type first gradually becoming diastolic now this information is very difficult to find if you just do a general search on high systolic blood pressure but if you type in high cortisol and blood pressure then you get a lot more information but but you have to know the link between the two before you even knew to research it so what this high cortisol well first of all it causes significant sodium retention and it also creates significant potassium suppression anytime you suppress potassium you can start getting a high blood pressure just from that alone and you can also affect the sympathetic nervous system which is part of the nervous system that controls this this is sympathetic this is parasympathetic that potential relationship there but also high cortisol will cause suppression of nitric oxide nitric oxide is a natural thing that our cells produce as a vasodilator to relax the blood vessels to reduce blood pressure yeah so cortisol suppresses that now in addition to that you can also consume certain foods that are high in nitric oxide like beets garlic meat and dark leafy green vegetables so here are a few things you can try start taking more vitamin D and I a vitamin D of course when you take that much you also want to take 200 micrograms of vitamin k2 you always want to take those together but here thing vitamin D is one of the most magical things to reduce blood pressure and the relationship between vitamin D and high cortisol is this anytime you see people with high core so you usually always see them with a vitamin D deficiency and when you actually take vitamin D you can actually help to lower cortisol so that is the relationship there and I think the reason for that is that vitamin D is not really a vitamin it in the body just to a certain extent it gets rid of inflammation it helpful in autoimmune conditions but it the other thing that I would recommend is start taking potassium and start consuming more leafy greens to get more potassium and nitric oxide I think that alone might greatly help you alright go ahead and try it and put your comments down below so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success

The Truth About Cholesterol Â LDL Cholesterol & HDL Cholesterol Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6SVB99mJHA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I wanted to create a video on the cholesterol myth simply because it been so brainwashed into our heads from 1950 more than any other myth that has been in existence Ancel keys in 1950 researcher did this huge study to correlate all these countries that got he wanted to study different countries in relationship to how many of them had heart disease and and what they ate if they were fat so he studied in half a dozen countries and this is what he came up with in a thumbnail sketch he found that we have heart attacks here and we have fat consumption here and he found that these countries the more fat that they consumed the more heart attacks that they got so then he was kind of like the father of the lipid heart attack theory and he was untime magazine and from there on out it kind of went south and it into our minds but here little things he basically kind of altered the information just a little bit here manipulated the study wasn half a dozen countries it was done with 22 countries and he left out the countries who ate a lot of fat and had low heart disease okay so these countries Norway and Holland he left those out okay and there was other ones as well and then he also left out the countries who ate low fat that had high amounts of heart attacks like Chile now if you include all of the data and the study it pretty much looks like this okay it doesn doesn significance of people that eat saturated fat actually have increased cholesterol or people that have increased cholesterol showed any increase in heart disease in fact you want to know how many studies in the world that we showed a relationship between these zero none of them can now that the way they wanted so what they do with any other researcher would do is basically manipulate the data and make it look make it a line to what their theory is so they can you know obviously get more grants but the point is that there is no study that shows this relationship here and it basically the greatest scam of the century so let more about what HDL is and LDL you heard HDL being good cholesterol and LDL being bad cholesterol well it cholesterol what does it stand for high-density lipoproteins low-density lipoproteins those are proteins they not even cholesterol they that carry cholesterol through the body so the HDL so-called good cholesterol carries the old cholesterol to the liver to be recycled okay now why is our body recycle cholesterol if it does it recycle well the fact is it not bad and we need cholesterol our bodies make 2,000 milligrams of cholesterol every single day near every single cell and your body makes cholesterol an egg would be 300 milligrams of cholesterol the truth is that when you eat more eat less cholesterol your body just makes more of it because it acts as a band-aid to help arteries that are corroding or getting ulcers or getting damaged or getting inflammation it acts to help as a healing agent and that is in the artery because it heal it as a scab it it are made from cholesterol to allow for the insulation to travel with the nerves we have all the cell walls are made from cholesterol most of our hormones are made from cholesterol especially the sex ones so we need this cholesterol desperately in order to survive if you didn able to survive and cholesterol is also needed to make vitamin D to help convert and increase the calcium into the blood so then we can take the other vitamins to transport into the bone I because that because it tells you the other half of the story with clogged arteries so we have this good cholesterol which carries all cholesterol to the liver recycles it that means it cholesterol carries cholesterol from the liver into the tissues okay but they really not bad they they back and forth out of the LDL only a very small part of the LDL is really really bad and it little particles because an LDL there a lot of different there sizes you have these big fluff balls and you LDL and the real small ones are the ones that form the plaquing around and inside the tin inside the artery itself and that the purpose is the body heal itself so now let is the problem with heart attacks okay well it inflammation because the wall of the artery is damaged from inflammation and it degenerative type situation and that why the cholesterol and the calcium comes in then to help heal it and then that causes inflammation sugar okay sugar is the big culprit sugar is very inflammatory and the amount of sugar that we eat not only will spike cholesterol and triglycerides because the body arteries but it will clog up your arteries more than anything and so and that includes the whole grains that the doctors are telling you it government whatever so it comes down the sugar so the problem is not the fat it the sugar okay so that other thing that causes inflammation is having an adrenal problem as well because your adrenal gland secretes cortisol and cortisol is a natural anti-inflammatory but when you lose that affect you end up with inflammation in the body but in a thumbnail sketch you don draw anymore you can go ahead and consume cholesterol I four eggs every single day for the last 20 years my cholesterol is about 160 170 160 which is totally normal and lastly I want to tell you something we you increase the good cholesterol to increase good cholesterol you have to consume egg yolks butter and cheese that especially from grass-fed cows will increase the good cholesterol okay what increases bad cholesterol sugar and junk food okay so I hope that helped a little bit unbraid wash you with this cholesterol myth but and I want to leave you if there IQ or having a high high IQ does not equal sanity just because someone is so-called educated doesn sane all right I video	Success
What Causes Tumors, Polyps, Moles & Pimples? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYahIgkrp6c	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey this dr. Bergin in this video we going to talk about the anatomy of a tumor so a lot of women are getting these fibroids and general population men women are getting polyps some people get moles some people get pimples if you look very closely in the mirror at your face you may have all these little bumps that are occurring and then they kind of go away and they come and go and come and go so there are a lot of things are constantly changing in the body you have over 60,000 genetic errors in your DNA every single cell every single day so you have all these things that are growing and shrinking so your body is constantly keeping these cells in check and they cellular growth so it doesn control and create tumors today I want to talk about what there is one interesting thing that occurs before you get a tumor or a fibroid or a polyp and that is low calcium now calcium is the main mineral that controls all of the communication in between the cells because you have these things called calcium channels and calcium carries nutrition and information between the cells and that why a lot of people with low calcium start to get all these issues with extra cell growth but it calcium it I wanted to mention that what starts this process is a lack of communication in the cell the cells these tight junctions right beneath the tumor they lose control and then your body starts making more and more and more cells and out of an out-of-control fashion and it starts growing a tumor and what happens is that this will occur if the soil of your body the terrain of the body is fertilized with these other factors as well nutritional deficiencies sugar did you know that cancer in and tumors live on sugar and fact they depend on sugar but we don have to worry about that because I know you don scans that monitor and screen for cancer look for those cells that are eating up all the sugar in the body that they detect cancer so by not eating sugar you can basically starve off these these cancer cells stress stress will set the person up for all sorts of problems with the immune system and more genetic defects chemicals you have pesticides insecticides herbicides and even chemicals and smoking chemicals in our food I just found out that the the binder that they feed a lot of chickens are fed with formaldehyde yeah that right so what happens is these chemicals create alterations in your DNA those are called mutations so mutations are sudden changes within this lifetime there control and they can alter your immune protective DNA repair mechanism so now we can so it grows out of control and then you have radiation now chronic inflammation let having a menstrual period every single month while you for great growing tumors from that terrible heavy crampy cycle so it really is a combination of all these things but it all starts with this calcium right here so let little bit more on this calcium first because in order to transport the calcium into the tissues you need vitamin D and there studies that show that vitamin D reduces cancer simply because it will help you regulate the calcium so the way it works is vitamin D is absorbed in the intestine by 20 times so that purpose is to get a lot more absorption into the small intestine so it can combine with a certain protein and now once it through the blood and it can transport through the body just straight calcium like if you take calcium carbonate that urn most supplements it does do anything is like eating a rock it hard to absorb it you need vitamin D to break it down and to get it absorbed into the blood so vitamin D is very very important if we take a look at the world and the equator right in the center where there of Sun there are very low rates of cancer in this area of the world as you go north in the colder weather is when people don much greater higher incidence of cancer and tumors now exception Japanese women have low rates of breast cancer and that is because they eat a lot of fish which have vitamin D and a lot of eel in their sushi you don D like three ounces is five thousand international units of vitamin D it incredible so so we need vitamin D from the Sun or a supplement always take vitamin d3 and then we also need vitamin F okay now what is vitamin A vitamin F is another name for the omega-3 fatty acids like in fish oil those are the polyunsaturated fatty acids there are omega-3 fatty acids and that oil is also good for anti cancer because it helps you absorb that calcium so we have vitamin F transports calcium into the tissues and then vitamin k2 and I done a video on this vitamin k2 drives the calcium all the way into the bone and it cleans up the arteries and it helps you modal mobilize calcium through the body and if you notice vitamin d3 vitamin F k2 those are all fat vitamins so we need fat to mobilize calcium and what are people telling you to avoid fat there essential for calcium and I forgot to put that that and these vitamins vitamin D vitamin A if you look them up control what called the differentiation of what cells turn into so if you deficient in vitamin A you this rough skin because the cells can be duplicated exactly like they should so again these vitamins are very very important in the transportation of minerals and the protection of tumors now I just want to get into one more thing and that would be the tumor cell and the cancer cell will hijacked your blood flow to because they need blood they need oxygen in some cases to feed that tumor and grow it and that angiogenesis if you want to look that up but that vessels are started feeding the tumor and the cancer and it just starts growing out of control but what interesting is what will stop the process of going from a benign to a malignant tumor or cancer would be phyto nutrients so there being done now on these vital nutrients that would be all those great cruciferous vegetables that you eating right now the kale those are essential for the blockage of this blood flow to the tumor and to cancer and that anti-cancer so those are some of the the points and the highlights of tumors and your skin with these little pimples and then how your body is constantly trying to counter this it to keep the soil of your body the terrain very help-help very healthy through these factors right here so I hope that kind of gave you some insights on why people get tumors and why they might not so apply this information and I will see you in the next video	Success
Muscle Cramps & Spasms Â Dr.Berg On Charley Horses	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKmHSqjFFUk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey Dr bur here in this video we going to talk about cramps charlie horses if you have these here are the causes there number one cause of cramps in the especially when you is medication the side effects of high blood pressure medication also high cholesterol medication and also uh prazone so that will majorly affect um the contraction relaxation of your muscles especially at night so that number one number two too much calcium calcium causes the contraction of muscles now that usually comes because your stomach is off if you have a lot of acid reflex or digestive problems that means you don calcium doesn that much calcium stuck in the joints and all that um another cause would be taking um like too many calcium supplements that are calcium carbon that you you want to prevent osteoporosis you going to get a lot of cramps because you calcium you know it could be you taking too much vitamin D without the V the uh the other fats like vitamin K2 and also the omega-3 fatty acids but too much calcium because calcium always works with other minerals and it could be too um you don to to transport and to relate the calcium so you always want to take these minerals together especially calcium magnesium so too much calcium will cause it and then and the reason I that up is because if you have a cramp and you just take straight calcium it might make it worse number three two little magnesium magnesium is the relaxation mineral of the muscle and that take if you have cramps so that knock it out like that you could also take calcium magnesium that would be good especially if it cuz that cause is too little potassium and because potassium also is involved in muscle contraction and that would come from not eating enough vegetables or a lot of stress that can deplete the potassium I don but our bodies need about 4700 milligrams of pottassium every single day yeah that vegetables every single day like no one deficient potassium and also if you add on stress that will deete deplete potassium and if you also add in the fact that Sugar de plates potassium no wonder the people have a lot of cramps magnesium comes from the leafy green so again if you have those vegetables you with one stone but I have calcium like you should have some good cheese from um maybe European cheese or grass-fed cheese or some Dairy like kefir or maybe yogurt that would be a good source of calcium versus just taking pills all the time but you just want to look at these as a potential uh cause of your cramps the other thing is um if you vinegar you more acidic and you this calcium into the tissues so the appleid of Vin is vinegar is really good for cramps because it acidifies and it transports a lot of these minerals and it also helps your stomach absorb the minerals and then lastly if you vitamin B1 due to stress or too many refined carbohydrates or sugar you have not necessarily uh cramps in your calves you in your calves so if they you press on them you need B1 and that would be a nutritional yeast so you can consume that and that just goes completely right away so go ahead and follow this information and I will see you in the next video	Success
4 Ways to Lower Ammonia in the Brain	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq_1O_J3Ud8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now today we and the toxicity in the brain now I have done some videos on ammonia before especially if you have a strong odor in your urine and what that comes from this is mainly going to be the toxic effect in your brain it when you ketogenic diet you of ketones as your fuel ketones are acidic ammonia is basic so ammonia is generated to counter some of the acidity from the ketones it your body is just compensating for the acidic urine so if you your urine is very very strong like ammonia I would not worry about it and now if you protein you may smell like an ammonia type odor that can be either some ammonia or just a really concentrated byproduct of ammonia which is called urea which is less toxic that is usually not a problem unless you have liver damage now if you have liver damage or kidney damage you may not break down ammonia Foley to urea and so it could actually build up and it could back up into the brain as well but ammonia is a byproduct of protein amino acids now the friendly bacteria in your gut also make proteins they make neurotransmitters so if there microbes you could actually generate excessive amounts of ammonia and that one cause of ammonia in your brain as well it solutions medically is that they use an antibiotic to lower ammonia of course I have a different viewpoint on that but if your gut is not right that could affect what ammonia elevates in the brain it can really be toxic to the neurons and affect your clarity of thinking your cognitive function your mood and you can actually even go into a coma from that now if you also over exercise that could produce a problem because your body is in this catabolic a breakdown Effect of amino acids so this ammonia could come from that potential now another interesting thing relates to this bacterium glyphosate from Ronda Peretti it goes after your bacteria in your gut and one of the deficiencies that is a manganese deficiency and manganese is essential in producing enzymes to break down ammonia so if you generating ammonia from your gut bacteria that could be the manganese deficiency from what you you and that which is in so many foods so as a natural remedy manganese can help detoxify ammonia another natural remedy to lessen the amount of ammonia in your body is sauerkraut why because you enhancing the friendly bacteria plus it the microbes so it probiotic vegetables will give you the fiber to make more friendly bacteria as well as the phytonutrients to help the liver in the phase 1 phase 2 detoxification so vegetables do help the liver and the kidney detoxify waste also go on a moderate protein diet try not to do too much especially if you have a liver problem or a kidney issue because that can just generate too much ammonia alright so there you have it these are the four things that can help reduce ammonia in your body so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
The Fastest Growing Disease in the World is...	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5Bybq7EPSI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	did you realize that diabetes is the fastest-growing disease on planet earth in China there are over a hundred million people that are diabetic a hundred million in India there are 68 million people that have diabetes in Mexico it even higher than any other disease in Australia someone gets diabetes every five minutes in fact one out of every fourth person in a hospital bed is either a diabetic or there because they have some diabetic complications and of course in America we don pretty much free of that disease we super healthy and I sarcastic now let is the fastest growing disease I just want to show you the mechanism here because it you already know this but carbohydrates are the culprits and the frequency of eating but mainly the carbs so what happens when you eat carbs is you get too much sugar in the blood so this pancreas here has a little cell called the beta cell and it insulin and insulin job is to get the glucose out of the blood to maintain normal glucose now it usually takes between 10 to 15 to 20 years to develop diabetes and diabetes is simply disease that you have too much glucose and sugar in the blood but it takes a long time for that to show up on a blood test so you doesn what compensating it and it than it should it times as much insulin compared to a normal person so it coming out there to keep this blood glucose normal so you go to the doctor they test you everything comes out normal you of course you but it because the pancreas is producing so much insulin and one complication of this is that the cells are starting to resist insulin okay as a survival mechanism because too much insulin is toxic so they condition called insulin resistance so now the body has to make even more insulin to penetrate to themselves to eventually end up in the blood to remove the glucose so here you are going along for 10 to 15 years and yes you problems getting up at night sleep apnea belly fat a fatty liver you lot of problems with that are associated with diabetes and another name for it is a metabolic syndrome but the blood glucose is still normal because of this compensation but eventually what happens is the beta cell the cell the pancreas starts to get tired and it starts to fail to compensate for this situation so now it insulin so the insulin is going to go down okay now if we don insulin and we have insulin resistance what glucose it that disease so diabetes is diagnosed very late on the chain of events if doctors knew this connection between carbs and insulin and blood sugars a little bit better they could probably focus on the diet here and prevent this problem and one thing they never do is check for insulin because if they did they would find that especially in a fasting insulin test and the test that you want to do is called a Homa IR they would find that you have high insulin there doctor who did a lot of research in in the VA hospital and he tested thousands of people and out of all these people with normal blood glucose a good percentage of him at high insulin and he would check them not two hours after he would check them sometime five hours after a meal and he would see this spike in insulin so this data was known way back then and of course when you have these breakthroughs or these realizations they acknowledged until you know most of the world has a major problem over many many years so this insulin resistance is in the periphery of the body it that get peripheral neuropathies which basically is a problem the furthest away from the heart it or your fingertips that notice it first so this is what I want you to do if you you your doctor this one question or actually two questions one is this now doc isn sugar in the blood then why aren recommending that I go in a low glucose or sugar or a carbohydrate diet and just see what they say because what shocking is that these basic things are not taught and medical school which is quite ironic anyway if you channel click the link down below learn how to get in a low carbohydrate diet do in a minute fasting so you can decrease the need for this pancreas to work so hard alright thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
Hashimoto Thyroiditis (Autoimmune Hypothyroid) Simplified by Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS3kG9Snu0w	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey Dr bur here in this short video we thyroiditis simplified now Hashimoto is a type of a thyroid problem which is a hypothyroid but it It and I want to give you some insights because when you do research on this you really won want to show you something this is a CBA uh collection of medical illustrations endocrinology volume 4 by Dr Frank net he I I this page is on something that describes cortisol the uh biological actions of cortisol that says cortisol diverts amino acids from the lymph tissue now the lymph tissue is all the immune tissue so it the cortisol pushes protein from that lymph tissue so you don don get a marked reduction in size of your lymph noes so in other words it causes an atrophy or shrinkage of your immune system yeah cortisol will cause the shrinkage of the immune system and then this accompanied by a release of antibodies now what does that mean it means that all those stored antibodies now are released into the blood so we getting a release of these little antibodies which basically help they part of the immune system and then it says an eventual decrease in overall antibody production so what happens with cortisol is you get a lowering of the entire immune system and and the ability to protect our bodies um which then breaks down the immune barrier and raises susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections so now what does all that mean it means that there huge connection between stress and the immune deficiency issues when we get into uh Hashimoto or any autoimmune problem just ask the person this one question when did it start and you going to find it will always start after some stress event a loss of a loved one a divorce a job loss uh an injury a trauma whatever and all of a sudden it sets up a weakness within the adrenal lowering the immune system and then your body starts attacking itself so why would your body body develop antibodies to attack itself other than that whole system is lost control and it control and that your bodies has producing little antibodies against itself and so it self attack and it keeps the thyroid inflamed so that triggered by I believe High cortisol which is stress and then the whole thing starts becoming a problem so now okay so that what about it well we want to do two things we want to reduce the inflammation because there good things to do for that um to help the immune system is to take vitamin D3 and by the way that adrenal uh thing that cortisol that will deplete your vitamin D as well so you want to take a little bit more than you normally take so I take about 10,000 IUS but make sure you take vitamin K2 with it I videos on this this is very important you need to take these together because they work together so take about 100 micrograms of K2 10,000 I use of vitamin D3 and then add some cod liver oil in there about 500 milligrams and this combination is very anti uh inflammatory so it piece of it but there that um is out there that you may want to look into it process and you a practitioner that has it but it called thyroid thyro tropen PMG thyrotropin PMG and the PMG part is really DNA extract of thyroid gland from a cow or a sheep whatever so it it they take the DNA out and they put it in the tablet it probably 40 years um in the area of Alternative Health and so when a person would take thyrotroph and PMG before bed they probably take one uh it goes into the stomach and because that DNA is very similar to our DNA instead of the thyroid attacking itself it goes what what the heck is this let attacking this thing in the stomach so it actually never even leaves the stomach it goes into the lymphatic system around the stomach and it kind of just hangs out there and it it causes a diversion it distracts the antibodies to attack this decoy and it leaves the thid alone so the guy who developed this theory is a genius Dr Royal Lee back in probably 20s and 30s um but this is a really simple way of kind of taking the immune system and shifting it um over here and leaving the thyroid alone so it can start to heal so th those are a couple tips in uh my two cents on the Hashimoto thyroiditis	Success

Is Fasting Healthy for a Diabetic?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGFF53o77nk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let healthy for a diabetic did you realize that 20% of all healthcare spending in the US is targeted to diabetes and diabetic complications now there are some mixed reviews that state that it 10 percent some experts say that it percent regardless if it 20 percent it billion to 700 billion dollars a year spent on diabetes that is crazy now in the US alone we have 84 million people who are a pre-diabetic and 30 million who are diabetic and I would venture to say that there least a hundred and fifty million that have insulin resistance that are on their way to becoming a pre-diabetic and still there is no agreement on the best diet for type 2 diabetes amongst the medical experts now why is that well I just gonna just draw a little connection right here guys I think I think you got the hint right there right you know why and as far as medication goes with diabetes there is targeting insulin resistance with metformin which is probably one of the most popular medication and then you have other medications okay this is an example that will increase insulin okay so those are the two main mechanisms the problem is that these medications have a special warning black label they actually increase the risk of cardiovascular mortality by 59 to 68 percent now wait a second wait a second doesn when you manage diabetes to keep you alive longer well apparently not apparently the goal is to manage your blood sugars to make sure your blood sugars are normalized well this is what you need to realize high insulin is just as damaging as high blood glucose so yes we need insulin and we need normal insulin but we don amounts and anytime you solve a problem with a solution to handle maybe blood sugars yet that solution is giving you a bigger problem then you need to really evaluate what going on now that foundation leads me to the main topic which is fasting for diabetes okay so what is the data and I put some links down below this is fascinating if you combine therapeutic fasting and no we starvation we controlled fasting where you sure you have all your nutrients okay so you because the problem with diabetics is they because they have insulin resistance so they can want to give them nutrients while they while the person produces some really amazing results okay within four months no need for insulin so I below so you can read the case studies and other studies on this decrease in a1c decrease in waist size number form able to control your blood Sugar why does fasting work for diabetes simply because it decreases the need for insulin okay and if the need for insulin is not there the pancreas doesn to work so hard so the cells that make insulin finally have a chance to rejuvenate okay because the real problem with diabetes is the high sugar and also the beta cell and the pancreas that produces insulin that around the clock to be able to regulate the high glucose that diet okay so the combination of decreasing the need for insulin by both of these actions right here low carb and fasting are extremely therapeutic versus treating the person with something that increases insulin well now we know why it creates problems because the side effects from too much insulin are just as bad as too much glucose so if you are a diabetic I would highly recommend you look into doing therapeutic fasting with a low carb and see if it can work for you thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
The Hidden Cause of a Manganese Deficiency	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUaOvdFhpyk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	we cause of a manganese deficiency now first let me just give you some basics on what manganese does in the body there it mineral that you don amounts you need it in small amounts and if you sorts of big problems most of the manganese in your body is located in your mitochondria the energy factory of the body now why do we need it in there because this trace mineral is involved in many enzymes okay so it like a essential helper element in these enzymes or cellular machinery that do certain work in the body so one of the purposes of manganese is to act as an antioxidant and the name of the enzyme is called manganese superoxide dismutase and the function of this enzyme is simply to clean up the byproducts of the energy that mitochondria ninety percent of the oxygen in the cells are used by the mono Kandra so we have a lot of oxygen burning a lot of fuel and giving off some byproducts and so this enzyme will help to stabilize the oxidative free radicals and it turns it into hydrogen peroxide and water okay so basically it some of the free radical damage that comes off the metabolism from the mitochondria the next one would be gluconeogenesis and this is basically the production of glucose in the body from non glucose sources whether it protein fat or ketones your body can make glucose from other things and so if you some studies that show that it will increase your risk of diabetes simply because you source of glucose so it this it ammonia which is a toxic by-product from protein so you have protein digestion ammonia and then to urea which is a less toxic by chronica protein which is in the urine so in order for your body to get rid of the excess ammonia you need manganese also it brain in converting glutamate which is amino acid to glutamine so glutamate is excitatory so if you have too much of this and not enough of that you have problems with sleeping you have a problem with focus you be nervous all the time so there could be a lot of problems with that manganese is also involved in bone and cartilage so if you sorts of structural problems especially if your mother was deficient and she carried you you can end up with um I don potentially scoliosis problems in bone formation and then we have wound healing with collagen so you can see it involved in so many things but now let talk about how you become deficient in manganese well if your liver is damaged that can do it now whole grains does have manganese but it also has phytic acid which actually will block the absorption of manganese so in nature sometimes the foods that will give you the nutrient also has things to prevent excessive amounts of it and that goes with the herbal teas as well teas have cannons and certain herbs that are high in manganese also are on high in tannins which counter the absorption of manganese it self-regulating mechanism to make sure you don lot of different trace minerals leafy greens now if you eat spinach it actually block your ability to absorb manganese but this is the one right here okay and that is a hidden source of manganese glyphosate if you heard of glyphosate it is the herbicide in GMOs when you consume GMO foods which is in a lot of foods soy corn canola oil in fact the entire grocery store is filled with GMO foods which has residues of glyphosate this is what can block manganese when an animal like a cow for example consumes their food of soy and corn which is grown with Roundup Ready glyphosate this herbicide the plant will not pull in manganese properly so this animal is consuming food without manganese so if you consume the animal that consume the plants that are manganese deficient you in manganese and you could have a potential problem with any of these functions right here so what can you do I think the most important thing is to as much as possible do organic foods thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success

Muscle Twitching After Starting Keto Diet? Â Dr.Berg on Muscle Twitch After Keto	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fFHFywDhCM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I had a question from someone that wanted to know why do I have twitchy now that I started Kido so what is twitching or techne it impulses that can happen anywhere in the body random and they pulsating little contraction it could happen here it could happen on your arm it can happen on your leg but basically it electrolytes or it when the pH becomes too far one direction and with this situation we talking about too alkaline calcium can start building up on the nerve and affect the impulses and that adding up cider vinegar or kombucha tea which are acidifier will usually help this condition however when you start doing keto ketones are acidic so the chances are it problem it there you definitely need more of when you do keto and that is electrolytes so if you have low magnesium or a low calcium which by the way could be because you have low potassium those loss of electrolytes are the most likely cause of tetany so if you you not doing enough vegetables that normally have the minerals in them that summary beef up your vegetables no pun intended or take some electrolytes and that should handle it thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success

How To LOWER Cortisol Levels? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fKo_dbXS0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hello dr. Berg here in this video we going to talk about how to lower cortisol cortisol is a very destructive hormone it belly fat and there and mixed confusing ideas about cortisol but I about cortisol so are hard to lower it things that you can do things you can avoid again it the adrenal gland on top of the kidney and it age the opposing hormone called growth hormone this is anti-aging goes down it bottoms out at age 50 so in other words the relative ratio of low growth hormone to cortisol cortisol naturally goes higher because it nothing to push it down so growth anything that increases growth hormone will help lower cortisol so growth hormone is made by a gland pituitary gland and it works with a liver and guess what it activates during sleep so if you can get more sleep or do something to improve your sleep then you will help yourself lower cortisol whatever that means more sleep but not necessarily taking a drug but doing it naturally more sleep more growth hormone less cortisol okay that number two IDF what growth factor what is that that is a hormone that is very similar to growth hormone but it released by the liver and it regulates fat burning and it actually helps regulates blood sugars when you eating so insulin regulate sugar when you eating IGF regulates triggers when you you grazing all day eating all day long and never give your body a chance not to eat then you will not trigger growth form unless you recommend do two to three meals a day if you really want to stimulate this and not have too many snacks and you your IGF will go up because anything that increases growth hormone will also increase this one here so these kind of work together right here all right number three Sun getting Sun on a regular basis that powerful to lower cortisol you go to the beach you get Sun and you feel calmer and then you take a nap sleep in Sun lower cortisol so really what you need to do is go on go to the beach for about six months and get Sun and sleep Sun and sleep and then I can do that so we have Sun and sleep and then vitamin D will also help as well I need to get D 3 D 3 is really good to help lower cortisol but realize that when you take it get it in daily dosages of about 10,000 international units if you son of a day you don because you Sun but in the days that it take the d3 one 10,000 IU sure you created a video on that I down below because you need to get the full scoop of what to take if you taking that much vitamin D just to balance it out alright walking is way better than any type of exercise to lower cortisol long walks getting space very therapeutic acupressure that found that all stress accumulates and you have to extract the stress manually on the body so there is techniques to help pull the stress out of your body so your body can sleep up here so we do acupressure to increase the sleep okay potassium increase your potassium normally in your body needs 4700 milligrams a day that salad a day this will help to balance cortisol as well because potassium supports part of the nervous system helps recovery it sympathetic nervous system okay that like that opposes the flight or fight mechanism that so potassium is very very good and there very important make sure you get your b1 through nutritional yeast and not synthetic vitamins nutritionally uses a natural form of b1 and take a teaspoon or a tablespoon put it in some plain kefir or yogurt mix it all up a little bit and then eat it you don taste put in peanut butter or something like that applesauce but b1 is a very very very very good thing and okay I thought of another one calcium a little calcium before bed calcium citrate calcium lactate don carbonate that calcium will also help before bed it will help you sleep that beneficial to help that now things to avoid well of course these are the things that you can do these things you shouldn know hang out with stressful people people that bring you down there types of people people that bring you up and people that bring you down just to avoid those negative covert hostile people and that this is about changing your environment with people and just mainly people whether it that you live in job wise or whatever just keep improving that because that can severely affect your your general state of being and the cortisol and if you constantly stressful you heck of a time with this right here okay so that	Success
Autoimmune Mysteries Revealed by Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNa9Q_7sQgs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	Hey, Dr. Bur here again. In this video, we conditions. It situation for most people. Uh there there is developing antibodies, which are things immune-wise that attack your own tissue. So, it allergy to your own tissues. So if you had autoimmune of the thyroid gland, um it would call it be called Hashimoto where the your cells your immune system cells are killing off your own thyroid and they you have um another type of thyroid condition, it body is attacking itself or sarcidosis where your body your lungs or you have MS multiple scerosis where you have antibodies against your own nervous system or lupus against the connective tissue in your uh in your body or rheumatoid arthritis you have antibodies against your own joints or Cushings you have antibodies against your own adrenal gland. So, I want to just kind of um take this complex problem and dissect it. One of the things that I do for complex problems is I I usually that will help me look at other areas of the problem. So, eventually the whole thing can be understandable. So, I the autoimmune and try to understand it more. So, let about the autoimmune conditions. If you take any of an any autoimmune conditions, which I hundreds of people come in with autoimmune conditions and I always ask them when did it start to get the clue and they always tell me it happened after a stress event and I found that very interesting. Usually after a loss of a loved one, a divorce, a severe injury, a loss of a job. So, so it a stress thing. Okay. So, stress can activate autoimmune. Uh I a condition where they didn some something like that. And losses are a thousand times more stressful than any physical trauma that could ever be. Um that a loss for many many years and grieve and grieve and cry and things like that. So it Now number two, how are autoimmune diseases treated? Well, one of the most common treatment they use is cortisol or prednazone. What is that? That hormones. So now we got two situations. We got stress and it adrenal hormones. What is what what gland uh does stress affect on the body? The adrenals. So really those losses those stressful events severely damage the adrenal gland. The treatment for autoimmune is adrenal hormones. Well, right there now we unravel this mystery and make this a little bit less complex. Now let into because the um autoimmune conditions are immune related. Let take a look at what controls the immune system. What parts of your body? Well, you have the thymus gland, you have the spleen, you have um the bone marrow, you have the gut, but did you know the adrenal gland controls the immune system as well? Yeah, the adrenal gland controls the white blood cells. In fact, I of the adrenal hormone cortisol. It says that the adrenal glands um release antibodies from the from the lymph nodes and they create a decrease if there the adrenal glands are overworking they will create an overall decrease in antibbody production. Interesting. And also when you have a dysfunctional adrenal, you will lose the barriers to the immune system and it makes your body more susceptible. That based on these three things, autoimmune conditions are really adrenal situations even though they affect the different tissues. So when people have Hashimoto for example, they thyroid, but they never look at the adrenal. They never look at the stress part of this. When I think about adrenal, I stress, accumulation of stress in the body. Um, so I think really what causes autoimmune is a stress state which then causes the adrenal gland to dysfunction and causes a loss of control of the immune system because it lowers your susceptibility and all sorts of things can happen when you do that uh because you have no more barriers to the immune system. So you could have um microbes come out, viruses come out of remission and just hammer that gland and you can have all sorts of dysfunctional things. So that uh two cents on what causes autoimmune. Now what I if you have an autoimmune condition is do an experiment on yourself. Talk with your doctor and and and start to go in the direction of improving your own body stress and just see what happens to your condition. see if you can put this condition back in remission because a lot of these conditions can go in remission which means they viral. Start to do things to improve stress rather than treat the condition directly with drugs and things like that. Just my recommendation. You don have to do it, but I that um I instead of treating the condition, reducing the stress state, changing the environment, uh doing things to get over that loss of a loved one. And you may find that these conditions greatly improve. Okay, so I hope that helped you. I will see you in the next video.	Success
What Is Hormonal Imbalance? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuxn_tzNMKE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey dr. Burke here in this short video we imbalance I very important principles there points I want to bring up on this number one it takes the tremendous amount of problem the body for a hormone to show up out of balance so just because your hormones aren really necessarily mean you fully healthy okay so that one especially with the adrenal gland when the adrenal glands are just dysfunctional yep literally you have to be 90 percent that of that Drina husband has to be dysfunctional and unless until it shows up on a clinically so it doesn stages and there things which is things that are below the radar and you the symptoms for a particular condition not just blood tests a lot of times people in their mind it unless they have a blood test you know they unless the blood tests show abnormal then they start worrying about it so you might go to the doctor and they might go okay come back in six months we checking this blood test over and over and over until you have the condition and then they treat it so that one you can tests okay number one number two let pretend that you do have a hormone imbalance so you have a deficiency of the thyroid hormone whatever what do people do they take a thyroid hormone right it sounds logical but what causes this problem that have to ask what causes a slow thyroid what causes a deficiency in an estrogen or an excess of insulin or excess of cortisol or any of these hormones that really what understanding of why what they do is they treat it directly they treat the hormone deficiency so if you hormone they prescription and then you supposed to be better what then when you stop taking it you go back to take it again doesn to me so let me give you a little background number one hormones are communications they like I you now you have little receptors here and then you understand what I say and then it collects and then you supposed to respond back of course I can in the room we could have a conversation so if we hormone would be the message is between two people all right so they travel through the blood and they connect into these little tiny receptors that receive that hormone and then do the function whatever their Homans supposed to do so the purpose of hormones is to create all these effects in the body from going to sleep to growing hair to being able to burn fat all these different things so you have 600 different hormones in the body now this is what I about the gland the gland is the thing that makes the hormone it that sends the hormone is the thing that receives the bio the feedback from this hormone to connect the dots to have this whole communication cycle this is the thing that it imbalances yet no one talks about the gland so what I next time you have a problem that related to hormones is when you go to your doctor ask him why instead of taking just taking the hormone why is it deficient because when you take a hormone let it have to work anymore and it create a dependency on that hormone and that is why taking years of thyroid hormone pills causes your own thyroid to shrivel up and become dysfunctional so that is a side effect of taking hormones as your glands don anymore ok so we want to support the gland what I like to do is I like to instead of getting into diagnosing hormonal stuff just take the Glam that makes that hormone and support it nutritionally you can even do there some even acupressure techniques that you can help the gland function better because glands secrete hormones they like mini muscles that send hormones into the into the tissues so we want to do things to improve the root of the problem so then the hormones can balance out whatever what if it decrease it doesn want to help normalize this right here so those are the two points that I want you to understand about hormone imbalance I hope this helped I will see you in the next video	Success

Why You Get Sleepy After Eating Protein? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLuRN6zi41I	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey I have a question do you ever get sleepy after we protein if you do this video is for you okay so let about the conditions first so excessive amounts of protein now what is excessive mean about a pound of chicken wings right that would be too much a large huge twelve ounce steak but sometimes when you go to a restaurant the portions they bring you especially when you get to meats are quite large okay they huge actually it can go up to twelve ounces to fifteen ounces crazy I recommend sticking with about three to six ounces because anything more it tends to overload the liver however if you you probably get away with a lot more protein but just realize that if you go too much it sleep because it sugars okay so excessive protein is one number two low fat proteins the lower the fat in the protein like whey protein for example some of the other protein powders the higher the insulin spike now if you not necessarily going to convert the fat it will increase insulin it could make you more tired especially if you do a large amount so here you consume low fat like protein like whey but you will stimulate insulin from the pancreas but there also trigger called glucagon and what does glucagon is it glycogen it okay that insulin and it when you by exercise or it protein okay so if you glucagon it triggering insulin because you to counter some of the bad effects from it okay you because this is a fat burning hormone so what will be driven into the cells the insulin will help it go in there but here keep triggering instant too much because it so we want to keep it low do I recommend whey protein powder no I don probably the least damaging of a lot of different proteins but the problem is that it and it of a natural protein that comes with in nature which comes with more fat and that has a lower insulin response okay so now the next thing is protein with carbs Wow when you consume a burger with fries a burger with a bun burger with ketchup you greatly enhanced insulin and this is where you a nap okay so start like protein and starches like potato not good meat potatoes not good I was raised in the Midwest we did meet Mateos 24/7 so that right now because I had a lot of body problems back then okay so we want to avoid that and then low stomach acids if your stomach is not acidic enough maybe you going down maybe you ate junk food for a long period of time and that weakened your acids and the way that you know that you have low stomach acids is that you have indigestion bloating gas heartburn acid reflux GERD that means you need more acid okay that help the digestion of protein if you in a low salt diet for example sodium chloride the chlorides are needed to make hydrochloric acid so people that are low salt dies for a long period of time typically have lower stomach acids then they start getting problems digesting proteins in general so the problem with the stomach of not being able to digest protein is that you not going to have the raw material for the building blocks to replenish all the body parts but again if you tired after consuming protein then look at these reasons why if you tired after consuming carbs we know it just insulin and if you get tired after eating fats that can be an overloading of the gallbladder as well or the liver alright so thanks for watching I will see you in the next video hey thank you so much for watching keep spreading the word and share this video	Success

How To Fix Oily Skin With Simple Hack Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJL_b8p9zq8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys I wanted to create a quick video on a simple fix for oily skin now the absolute worst thing you could do is use cleansers and start scrubbing this oil on your face because you can end up damaging it the skin is very delicate and you want to understand what causing this problem what it and it there face they they sebum okay so the sebum is the actually oil that comes out so the question is why are these glands overactive well it has to do with in a production of a hormone called androgens so antigens are being produced too much and antigen is a male hormone so in a female body there are two glands that make antigens one would be the ovary and the other is the adrenal gland okay so now the quick fix for oily skin would be to take zinc because zinc lowers antigens but we want to take it one step further and find out why would your body be making too much energy and there causes one it gland now what is it adrenaline it stress plant it sits on top of your kidneys you have two of them and so if there constant stress that causing an overactive adrenal gland which is producing too much antigens in that case you have to remove this source of stress now the other reason would be insulin insulin converts to androgens okay now insulin is a carbohydrate hormone and that and frequent eating and especially if you women that have polycystic ovarian syndrome PCOS or pcod same thing have facial hair oily skin belly fat because of the antigen spike because the insulin is too high okay so no in that situation you would want to lower the sugar and decrease the frequency of eating I put a little link down below of how to do that but there balance estrogen and it put a link down below to get some more data this but dim is a super concentrated blend of cruciferous vegetables that would be like kale broccoli radish cauliflower those type of vegetables so not only does dim lower androgens but it also balances estrogens now what I mean lower energons I lowering it to a normal level not extremely low or you don because even men take Tim to help support their prostates because a lot of times that could be high level of estrogen so Tim is just great to help balance certain hormones thanks for watching hey if you haven subscribed press the button below and I will keep you in the know hey that runs	Success
Alkaline vs. Acidic body Â How to Know If You're Too Alkaline or Too Acid? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_AKdZ2E1oo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys dr. Burke here in this short video I question is how do you know if you too alkaline or too acid and that good question because even when people tell you you alkalize it it the fact because what what body fluid are you talking about I mean are you talking about the blood which normally should be slightly alkaline or you talk about the stomach which is extremely acid or the urine that should be slightly acid or the bile that should be alkaline or the large bowel that should be acid so you always want to determine what pH you talking about what I talking about is the blood pH the blood page should normally be slightly alkaline and if it too excessively alkaline you can get all these symptoms right here if it little less than that it could still be on the up and side but just not as alkaline you can be more acidic so that can occur if your blood pH is too far this way versus too far this way okay so let use symptoms versus rather than like a pH thing for your saliva or your urine because how you going to check your blood you know it test and by the time you take the blood out of your body it oxidizes with the oxygen and the pH shifts so it hard to detect that so I like to use symptoms first okay so if you acid you could have possibly chest pain palpitations because it affects the the electrolyte mix headaches anxiety muscle weakness bone pain joint pain and air hungry like like your can air okay and then alkaline would be excessively aqua be much muscle twitches like tetany that little twitch right here or on the arm allergies muscle spasms muscle cramps muscle weakness why because the calcium is all locked up you dehydration because you need this the electrolytes need to be hydrated correctly that the pH is off to alkaline you can pain and also difficulty breathing this would this be more of a hyperventilation just it just a difficulty with breathing but sometimes it you might have some of these in some of some of these so there to determine what way you are all you have to do is drink some apple cider vinegar like two tablespoons and some water with a straw drink that and see if some of these issues clear up and you feel better and if you do that means that you that you citrate or calcium magnesium and see if you don to determine what pH you are so that that it expensive test and some people I just give them a little calcium magnesium or lactate and boom like half these things clear right up but the ultimate thing to do is to get on the right eating plan and your body will bring your pH to the correct balance now as we about symptoms and causes I have a quiz down below in the description box that 104 questions go ahead and take this quiz and I will send you a report to tell you what all right thanks for watching	Success

Identify Arsenic Poisoning Through Your Nails	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlGLVe9QP2c	Dr. Eric Berg DC	did you realize that you can identify arsenic poisoning through your nails arsenic which is a very potent carcinogen has affinity for keratin which happens to be in your nails so the presentation would be this transverse or horizontal whiteness or a band across your nails I realized that that one indicator and unless you actually get tested you sure but this is definitely one symptom so if you have this go get a check there relate to arsenic poisoning skin issues like a red rash or swelling warts abdominal pain nausea vomiting diarrhea muscle cramps headache peripheral neuropathies which is either a pain or tingling or burning on your feet or your your fingertips and this could also be caused by diabetes but arsenic poisoning is one of the causes now the important thing about arsenic is to differentiate between the two types of arsenic you have inorganic arsenic in organic arsenic now this word organic is a different definition than if you were to buy organic food okay organic food relates to food without pesticides or insecticides or even antibiotics when we organic arsenic we arsenic that is naturally in the soil okay it inorganic which is man-made organic arsenic is it is in the soils and it pretty much going to be in all vegetables to some degree however it doesn organic and it your our bodies generally can deal with it much better but this is the problem right here inorganic arsenic now take awhile guess what country is the world leading user of arsenic since 1910 this is a hint right here it course so in America we use a tremendous amount of arsenic we tonnes of arsenic that put into our environment and that can come from many different sources pesticides insecticides they used to put it in fertilizers with the chicken byproducts I think they banned that in 2015 but don they might just he we have rice 70% of the arsenic that in our environment is from rice especially brown rice rice has grown in a very wet environment and apparently that environment or that condition allows the rice to poll this arsenic into the plant so if you lot of rice you could potentially have higher levels of arsenic but of course if you worry about that and then fruit in fruit juice contributes to 18 percent of the arsenic exposure and of course if you you definitely not for juices and then you have the vegetable family which is giving us about 24% of all the arsenic but realize that if the vegetable is organic and not grown with insecticides pesticides that type of arsenic is probably mostly organic so it less toxic fish also has some arsenic or organic arsenic in very very small amounts and there remedies that can also help detoxify arsenic the biggest one is alpha lipoic acid and then choline and then the B complex I would recommend getting the B complex from a natural source like nutritional yeast that unenriched alright that thanks so much for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success

When Should You Not Take Extra Potassium?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZWzdJ03_Pc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hi guys today we potassium and when you should not take extra potassium the typical situation is that people are deficient potassium and they need more potassium and it actually a rare condition where you would need to cut back okay now when I talking about excess potassium you have this condition called hyperkalemia this is too much potassium in your blood ninety-eight percent of all the potassium is inside the cell versus the outside the cell in order to really know what recommend taking an intracellular potassium test and you can look it up online to try to find out where you can take it I think it would be a very valuable thing but that would measure how much potassium is inside the cell that being said some of the symptoms with hyperkalemia would be palpitations muscle weakness numbness abnormal heart rate and shortness of breath and these are the identical symptoms by the way when you have high blow Kelli Mia which is interesting so you can what you could take a blood test however these are the top three conditions where you would not want to take potassium and I stage 5 kidney disease that would be end-stage renal failure renal meaning kidney so if the kidneys are really diseased you would not want to take potassium however this is rare and potassium normally protects the kidney okay it helps the kidney especially with blood pressure in fact it can probably help you lower your blood pressure so just because you have kidney disease doesn need normal amounts of potassium so you just need to check with your doctor they avoid potassium or take potassium if you have a kidney problem and the real issue with this is that if the kidney is diseased and it stops filtering and you be able to release it and get rid of the excess amount and too much potassium could be a problem but if you have healthy kidneys it to develop high berkelium you know too much potassium blood through taking too much potassium because simply your body can easily get rid of excessive amounts of potassium mainly from the function of aldosterone this is a hormone from the adrenal glands and the purpose of aldosterone is to retain sodium and get rid of excess potassium so let me just kind of cover this next reason and that an aldosterone deficiency and that can come from adrenal failure several other diseases of the adrenal gland in which you just don in that case you won regulate properly the potassium and it can go too high again very rare okay Addison also rare where you basically lose the function of your adrenal glands and in that state you you lose a lot of weight your skin gets bronzed the inside of your lips and even your lips can get blue your immune system is very very fragile and you lose a ton of salt or basically sodium so if you were to take excessive amounts of potassium guess what you down sodium even more well Addison really need more salt in a patient with this condition should be taking a ton of salt through the day to actually maintain the adrenal function and they should definitely avoid potassium because this is the mineral that they having a problem they have enough potassium but they don sodium and as a side note insulin helps you absorb potassium in your cells and if you have insulin resistance like a lot of people have guess what you generally going to be deficient in potassium you enough potassium in cells which is a more common condition so taking more potassium will help regulate insulin and definitely help insulin resistance alright guys thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
What is Restless Leg Syndrome Â Dr.Berg on Thiamine Deficiency and Restless Leg Syndrome Connection	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJxLymQn0s0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	we syndrome someone had a question and want to know more about it so we talk about it so restless leg syndrome is a condition that I even had in my 20s and I from sleeping it because the lower part of your body is just it just has to move it much energy in it so you have this impulse to fidget you can you can that is a deficiency of b1 thiamine okay now thymine has many different functions creates a lot of different symptoms there are several possible things that can influence this condition one because b1 is involved in the krebs cycle which is the energy production in the mitochondria if you you which is the energy currency that feeds the nervous system okay number two there thiamine in the cell in the mitochondria and if you don nerves start developing atrophy so they start dying off you to have irritation in there before it becomes damaged and the irritation would be near itis or nerve pain which is peripheral neuropathy which you see in diabetics where the bottom of the feet are tingling burning painful and then numbness or you might feel it in your fingertips so when you think neuritis always think deficiency of b1 but over time when it becomes chronic you lose the function of those nerves like in peripheral neuropathy where becomes numb and basically dead but if this is happening in the brain you first have excessive thinking and analyzing everything to death and then it starts going down where basically you you start losing your your ability to think salt problems and also have a good memory the next function a b1 has to do with making this chemical called acetylcholine acetylcholine is involved in motor control this is like the certain nerves that control the muscles which are called a motor nerves and in which case that you cannot see still your body has to move so with this condition it restless leg syndrome it whole body where your body just cannot be still and there conditions that are very similar but they akathisia which is an irresistible urge to move or another condition which is tardive dyskinesia which stems from the chronic use of certain psych drugs which deplete vitamin b1 and so now you have all these tics and weird motions in your body that you can is a b1 deficiency why because psych drugs deplete b1 as one of the things that it does and this condition also relates to low amounts of dopamine and guess what in order to make dopamine you need b1 okay so if you don you and then you have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder where you see this in kids they cannot sit still right well guess what they told you to sit still and stop moving but guess what it wasn it was just low b1 probably because you a child because the refined carbohydrates and high levels of sugar like I consumed a tremendous amount of my 20s created 2 b1 deficiency and then gave me this symptom right here if you know someone who has ADHD you want to give them b1 zinc for sure folate and EPA which is you can get this from fish oil which is an omega-3 fatty acid in fact the derivation of this word right here comes from the Greek knot and then to sit an inability to sit so in summary without enough b1 you hard time just being there comfortably sitting without the urge of having to move the best source of natural vitamin b1 would be nutritional yeast thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
5 Weird Things That Trigger Excessive Sneezing	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY4xF6mf6mQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I wanted to mention five weird things that can trigger excessive sneezing so the first question is what is a sneeze well it little receptors and your sinuses that are on a circuit that go deep into the brainstem that trigger a reflex that then goes to your diaphragm and your lungs and your chest muscles which create a synchronized breath in and then an explosion of air out to clean out your sinuses okay that is and so the first one on the list is birth control pills which is interesting can cause sneezing the second one is liver in gallbladder congestion so if there bladder problems a person could actually start sneezing now birth control pills do have the ability to damage the liver and so that could be the link between these two right here now when some people look into the Sun they start sneezing now there is a photic sneeze reflex that they don someone sneezes when they into the Sun it could be some neurological crossover and the circuitry or between the optic nerve and the olfactory nerve which isn the sinuses but I would imagine there more of our survival mechanism I sure exactly why but many people sneeze at least initially when they go outside but after the initial couple sneezes they don we don three number four under active or hypothyroid condition can cause excessive sneezing and the number five overeating probably because it triggers the liver in gallbladder now have you ever walked in the aisle of a grocery store and just start sneezing especially the aisle that has all the perfumes I want to just mention that this is not weird it many chemicals in perfumes which are very toxic got acetone benzaldehyde which is a known Kotik ethyl acetate phalates which are endocrine disrupters parabens styrene which is a human carcinogen methylene chloride which is banned by the FDA for a toxic substance but it by the FDA so what I would do if I were you is I would look at some of your perfumes if you have them in your house and and just see if that ingredient is in there then they put this other chemical called cinnamaldehyde and a lot of people are allergic to this right here well first of all it insecticide for mosquito larvae okay and it for steel but they for some reason they put it in your perfumes pretty crazy so the best thing is not to wear perfumes and if you are I would use some essential oils anyway there you have it the five weird things that can cause excessive sneezing so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
Never Take Bile Salts with These 3 Conditions	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWM-1_vMEis	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so there was a question from someone that wanted to know when not to take bile salts is there any contraindications so I wanted to create this video for that person first of all most people need bile salts and usually they are made by the liver and they in the gallbladder and when the gallbladder stores the bile salts it concentrates them up to 20 times so it a super concentrated mixture to help break down fats so you can extract the fat soluble vitamins and the essential fatty acids from the food that you eat the pancreas releases lipase and enzyme to break down fats and then it actually help to dissolve this fat into the small particles so you can utilize the nutrients from the fat so we make about a quart of bile every single day and 90 percent of the bile is recycled through the small intestine bile is also necessary to help a person detoxify chemicals from the liver and out through the body and it compound and you can also take purified bowel salts to help you with the digestion of fats and also to prevent the formation of gall stones because gall stones come from a deficiency of bile salts but there situations where you wouldn take them number one if you had diarrhea why well because purified bile salts help to retain fluid in the colon and they help to lubricate food going through the colon so if you have diarrhea and you take purified bath salts guess what you diarrhea so you don number two hyperthyroid the liver and the bile salts help in the conversion of t4 to t3 eighty percent of this conversion happens to the liver and 20% happens to the kidney so if your thyroid is already making too much of the active form of thyroid hormone which is t3 and you add more bile salts and make more t3 you gonna make it worse so you don recommend bile salts to anyone with a hyper thyroid state but on the flip side if you have a hypothyroid condition you would want to take it because it convert from t4 to t3 in fact it could be the reason why your thyroid is slow in the first place third reason why you wouldn take purified bile salts is that if you have some type of bile malabsorption problem now that could be caused because your intestines are not absorbing the bile salts because you have Crohn disease which is inflammatory condition or celiac which is another inflammatory condition or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth which will mess up the balance of bile and there conditions as well so because purified bile salts gets recycled and you also need help by your microbes if you have a problem with either one and this file is concentrating you don more now some people have the gallbladder removed have a situation where there tube is maybe too large and it draining right into the small intestine in that case they have diarrhea and your doctor will recommend a bile acid binder and here one medication that they use but there many more you can check with your doctor on that but it slow down the bile in your body but the problem with that it comes with certain side effects because now you have the inability to absorb certain fats I above items will like vitamin A D and K because you salts but if your body is making too much bile or you have too much bile realize that the trigger for bile production is saturated fats so one thing you do is lower the amount of fats in your diet to about 60 grams per day not any lower than that because you need the fats but if you have too much bile in the first place you don about adding more saturated fats alright there you have it thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
When NOT to Take Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P49LC3PyCsE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I situations where you would not want to take apple cider vinegar or any type of acidifier but I do want to mention that most people benefit greatly by taking out cider vinegar simply because most people don acid they need in the stomach to digest normally your pH should be between 1 & 3 which is extremely acid but as we age and we consume junk foods the pH and stomach increases and becomes more alkaline so now we lose our ability to digest especially protein okay and also we lose our ability to kill microbes we also lose our ability to absorb minerals and if we can protein fully it ends up undigested lower in the digestive tract and then you get all sorts of bloating and problems but there are three main situations that you would want to avoid adding vinegar to your diet one is if you have an ulcer now how do you know if you have an ulcer well one simple way is to take some up soda vinegar like you would always want to dilute it take a tablespoon or two in some water and drink it if this makes your symptoms worse you could have an ulcer okay because you stomach on an open wound and that gonna make things a lot worse there really good remedy for ulcers zinc carnosine you take fifty milligrams three times a day works like a charm take this dosage for a month and then you can reduce it with a blend of all of the trace minerals because anytime you take one trace mineral without all of the trace minerals you control things either out of balance another thing to help ulcers would be to take chlorophyll okay wheatgrass juice powder is loaded with chlorophyll you drink it on empty stomach very very good for all sirs and of course if you to my channel you definitely need to do healthy ki tale in a minute fasting because that will give your body a chance to heal and eat the right foods to avoid this problem in the future now the next situation is gastritis this is a situation where the stomach is inflamed and you regurgitation of acid that comes up to the esophagus so if this stomach is inflamed and you add more acid it going to make it worse a good remedy for this condition is DGL licorice probiotics unless you have C Bo if you video down below to learn more about it and it wouldn carnosine for this condition as well in addition to that marshmallow root is also good for gastritis and the other condition is called zollinger-ellison syndrome where you have a tumor which is usually in around the pancreas it could be in the small intestine that is causing a greatly increased production of gastric acid which is causing an officer so the great majority of the population will benefit from this that you that is not going to benefit thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
Heart Attack vs. Heartburn: How to Tell the Difference?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-eDavccrC4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I had a question with someone that wanted to know what are some of the differentiating factors between symptoms from a potential heart attack versus symptoms from actual heartburn that good question because they similar in fact some of the symptoms are identical both will give you like a cold clammy type feeling both will produce nauseousness both can cause the burning pain all right so now let the differences well typically if you have left pain pain it goes down the left arm it but not always because sometimes if you it can produce pain on the left side but it will come from a stress event or exercise but not always sometimes you may get heart attack symptoms after you eat but as a side note you should know that there are over 300,000 non cardiac visits to the hospital every single year so obviously these people had either heartburn or some type of digestive problem that it wasn now with heartburn you after the meal but not always because if you have an ulcer that heartburn you could have it when you not eating when you can have heartburn so these are just general guidelines typically with heartburn you bloating which you gonna have with a heart attack so that different you may have acid reflux so acid that comes up in your esophagus so that heartburn you may have more burping belching but one really good indication to know that it if you take apple cider vinegar and some water let in a glass of water and you drink this down and your heartburn goes away well then chances are it heartburn now as far as food goes the history of what a person ate let you ate a lot of sugar junk food well that could create this or this so you really can based on a history of what someone ate but one of the best things that you can take as far as a supplement to prevent heart attacks especially angina is vitamin E a complete complex I about the combination of not just a cough or also all of them but tocotrienols together as one unit that not only good for angina the actual cramping of the muscle that could be coming from the muscle itself but it also good for problems in the artery because you need vitamin E as an antioxidant to prevent the breakdown or the tissue so about a minute you can actually prevent the build-up of plaque okay so vitamin E is important and of course the healthy version of Kido low carb and in a minute fasting very very important as far as heartburn goes you want to incentivize stomach you want to take out the cider vinegar you want to take things like betaine how to chloride before you eat like you could probably take them in pills take like four or five before you eat for a few months to acidify the stomach and then of course healthy keto and ifr going to be essential for that alright thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
You Have Good and Bad LDL (low-density lipoprotein)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYbPiqO5ZXE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we difference between good and bad LDL now normally someone is taught that LDL is the bad cholesterol but that actually true LDL is divided between two different parts and just so you know LDL stands for a low-density lipoprotein it protein that is carrying cholesterol through the body from the liver out to the tissues HDL takes the cholesterol from the tissues and brings it back to the liver so we are so brainwashed to think that LDL is the bad cholesterol but they specific types of LDL it does take a special test to get this information but I would highly recommend that you do it I put a link down below for more information so when you go to your doctor you can ask for this specialized test so here this stands for a particle and SD is small dense okay so the LDL is a smaller dense type and this is the type that the real bad one that can invade the arteries deep into the tissues and create all sorts of problems this is the one that has the oxidized cholesterol which will increase your risk of getting heart attack by four times this is the type that you normally see with the diabetic because it comes from a high carb diet but especially high amounts of fructose fructose will create more of this more than glucose so also realize that sucrose like table sugar is like half fructose and half glucose so a lot of the sugars contain fructose and this type is called type B just so you could actually differentiate now we get 2 lb LDL / p which is particle right here lb is large buoyant the large fluffy type of LDL okay it this when someone does the ketogenic diet because it you in a minute fasting you cholesterol from the fat cells so you need these these LDL carriers to transport cholesterol in different places but this type of LDL is benign it arteries or creates damage okay this is the bad one this is the good one I suggest to do your own testing on this and you will see that if your LDL is high it you and in a minute fasting if you carbs you this right here the other thing to look at is the triglycerides you want them low and you them low if you which is a good indicator because you using triglycerides now for your energy source also you want your HDL higher and you normally see this when you and I F alright so that keep it very very simple and I put an additional link down below for more information on this but definitely get it checked and if you it you high you here you or on the low side thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
Best Remedy (Antidote) for Tylenol Poisoning	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtXSelhaI4Q	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so we best remedy or antidote for Tylenol poisoning another name for Tylenol or the generic version of Tylenol is acetaminophen and there induced liver injury especially if you take large amounts of it either by accident or on purpose over 70,000 people are hospitalized from taking too much of this and over 300 people a year die of Tylenol poisoning so what this Thailand I destroys the liver cells and one of the best antioxidants for the liver that helps protect against damage is glutathione but the remedy or antidote you need to take which is widely accepted by the medical field is NAC and that stands for n-acetylcysteine NAC is a precursor or a building block for glutathione and I would also recommend taking glutamine with that which is not a necessity but I sent something that can actually help bolster the glutathione but glutathione is the most powerful antioxidant for the liver your body actually makes it and it protects the liver cells against free radical damage and poisons and so it decreases the side-effects from things that are poisonous to the liver now as far as the amounts that you would take if you have a large exposure to Tylenol would be a hundred and forty milligrams per kilogram of your own body weight so if you weighed 150 pounds that would be 68 kilograms you would need to take nine thousand five hundred and twenty milligrams okay now normally NAC comes at about a thousand milligrams so you would take nine pills right off the bat so you want to cut this in half so you take like five thousand milligrams which is five pills every four hours 17 times now this protocol is mainly for people that had a tremendous amount of Tylenol like it don you need to take tylenol because you have serious my and you you dosage I would recommend something like maybe 1 to 2 thousand milligrams every four hours for a 24-hour period after you get the headache this can actually help minimize encounter some of the destructive nature of this chemical I just want to mention Reye now try syndrome mainly affects children not adults and it it as well like viruses but if you know of anyone that actually has this disorder I put a link down below because this is very important you would want to give that child a lot of b1 like 750 milligrams which is way over the RDAs but this has been known to help counter allow the effects alright guys thanks for watching I will see you in the next video so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
The Best 7 Herbal Diuretics for Fluid Retention	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWJY1yjW7J0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we retention and seven of the most powerful herbal diuretics a diuretic is something that will release fluid from your body there are synthetic chemical diuretics and then there are also natural diuretics but probably the most common cause of fluid retention is the high levels of glucose in your diet so I don every gram of glucose it retain 2.7 grams of water so you gonna be waterlogged if you too many carbohydrates and I see it all the time I event or something and I can just see the person their feet are all puffy and filled with fluid and they lot of carbs it to solve and then if you actually consume enough foods with potassium as in vegetables a person typically will not be retaining fluid an average person in the u.s. is consuming way too much sodium and not enough potassium and they thing we okay it your backyard and it is super healthy for your liver and the potency of the diuretic chemical in dandelion is concentrated in the greens not necessarily the root so I would recommend putting it on your salad you can get it from the health of store or just go in your backyard dandelion greens are very very very high in potassium which also helps push the fluid out but dandelion greens help you at many different levels the next herb is Yuba earthy and this acts directly on the kidney to help push fluid out it it bladder infections now horsetail typically people think of horsetail as something that is good for your nails and your hair because it silica and it is and it detoxify aluminum but horsetail also has certain properties to push fluid out of the body the only challenge with horsetail is it it will tend to deplete vitamin b1 so if you just make sure you put the beet complex back in there or nutritional yeast Horst Heldt is also really good for children who have bedwetting next one is garlic garlic is a potent diuretic it very powerful antimicrobial antifungal anti-ice anti-candida anti-inflammatory antioxidant and it has anti-cancer properties next one is black tea black tea gets rid of excess sodium it releases sodium from the body but not potassium so therefore you can have the right ratios it will inhibit a hormone from the adrenal glands called aldosterone this hormone mainly functions to retain sodium so if you reduce aldosterone you retain sodium as much so you get rid of fluid parsley parsley is really good for blood pressure it also inhibits the release of potassium so it will help retain potassium and in Germany parsley is approved as an official diuretic and last one is stinging nettle root if you this make sure you get the root portions okay not necessarily the leaves but this one is very powerful as an anti-inflammatory but it will get rid of excess fluid and some men take it for enlarged prostate so it can help with that as well alright guys so there seven herbal diuretics so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success

Wilkins reported receiving consultation fees from NGM biopharmaceuticals and then dr. mints reported receiving research support from all sorts of companies including AstraZeneca Bayer GlaxoSmithKline Medtronic Merck no Varys Abbott and the list goes on and on and on so right there I could pretty much stop that how are these researchers are going to be unbiased they companies that possibly have another interest alright next point this was an observational study okay the data was taken from six other studies over seventeen point six with 29,000 615 people between the ages of 34 and 79 both men and female now an observational study is a study which uses a food frequency questionnaire this is not a clinical study where they using randomized controls no they using a question here over a period of 17.6 years that is so subjective how is someone going to remember what they ate even last week and they don how frequently these questionnaires are passed out it could be a year it could be every five years who knows but the point is that this is not objective it not reliable a study is only as good as the data is true incredible so self-reported questionnaires are at the lowest bottom barrel of scientific studies all right next thing what did they evaluate how many variables did they look at one they based this very strong conclusion on looking at one thing eggs that you know cardiovascular disease and death did they look at whether the person ate Donuts their sugar level carbohydrate content the stress level no how about smoking no how much exercise they did absolutely not soda consumption if they had diabetes or not no none of this was looked at that was all omitted they looked at one thing eggs so realize - when they use the word association that has nothing to do with causation cause and effect at all so another term for this is miss classification bias that they couple other things here number one the data is just not reliable the questionnaires very subjective had the lowest credibility they were only looking at one variable no blood test they didn type of LDL they didn reasons why these people had heart failure and died like what about cancer HIV liver I mean a person eventually is going to die and the hearts gonna give up it causes the heart attack there are other reasons they didn also they didn that show opposing findings okay so you can see there are quite a few studies that show no relationship between the intake of eggs and serum cholesterol here cholesterol levels have no significant effects on plasma LDL here found no association with eggs and cardiovascular disease dietary consumption of eggs was not associated with cardiovascular disease here another one no association with cardiovascular disease and here another one 2009 by Jones no association between egg consumption and cardiovascular disease alright guys in summary anytime someone uses science to prove something make sure you personally look at the study see if the data is truthful or not because this study is just complete and utter BS so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
Detox and Die-Off: The Herxheimer Reaction	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW1FSIKhy7k	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let another name for this is herxheimer reaction now what either using a medical antibiotic or a natural herbal antibiotic or some type of remedy or even a probiotic which is killing microbes and there things being broken down and released and your immune system is spotting it and reacting with it so the symptoms of died off would be feeling like you have the flu achiness inflammatory joints fatigue sore throats rash lung mucus coughing swollen glands headaches and fever so all of these symptoms are occurring because your own immune system is creating them it microbe it this inflammatory State and I personally done so many detox programs and experimented with so many remedies that I bed for two weeks I wouldn I did it like 15 year 20 years ago I would go really slow I would test the waters I would take a very small amount and especially when you deal with even probiotics I have a probiotic a liquid probiotic with one person it can actually help them with arthritis the next person they can have a reaction with it so I always recommend taking a very small amount maybe a half a teaspoon if you herbal detox take a very small amount just to see how you feel because the last thing you want to do is end up in bed for two weeks completely sick now in your mind you might be thinking oh this is great detoxing no you just having an immune reaction where your immune system is creating a whole bunch of inflammation so if you started a detox program and you have this reaction and I antibiotics I of herbal remedy I would instantly cut back or stop it until you feel a lot better okay then when you start it back again go really really slow maybe even take one drop of the thing or a fourth of a capsule just to test the waters and I would also recommend having some activated charcoal available or bentonite clay and you take this and it can help to reduce the reaction so this is how it works it works on the principle of adsorption not absorption so you have the endotoxin or whatever is going on there and then activated charcoal or bentonite clay will start attracting around it okay and cover the toxin and help you eliminate it from the body another good remedy would be malignant very effective for died off from Candida and then another one is NAC because this actually will increase glutathione which will help the liver counter some of the free radicals that are building up from this and lastly the question is what herbal remedies are good detoxifiers well it kill off microbes so that that list that could be oregano oil could be even garlic it could be time could be black walnut hauls or clove so I put a couple links down below so you can look at those things as well thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
The Best Foods for a Recovering Alcoholic	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4qLZzjIq-k	Dr. Eric Berg DC	had another question related to a recovering alcoholic and what would be the best foods for that individual well what do you have you have liver damage maybe some inflammation maybe a fatty liver maybe even cirrhosis you definitely have nutritional deficiencies so the best foods that I would recommend starting from the top would be cruciferous vegetables why because cruciferous vegetables have an added X Factor they have a lot more phytonutrients that other vegetables just don with repairing liver function we need a lot of natural antioxidants from the food because there and free radical damage now as far as deficiencies are concerned you see definitely low vitamin b1 you gonna see other B vitamins deficient definitely going to see zinc deficient a lot of other trace minerals so for that reason number 2 shellfish shellfish contain all of the trace minerals very very high in selenium and zinc and iodine which is great for the liver and especially the selenium both of them can act as antioxidants now number three we have sunflower seeds sunflower seeds are very high in vitamin b1 which is very very important in liver function and definitely if the person has drank alcohol they vitamin b1 but of course my favorite is nutritional yeast you vitamins and nutritional yeast and nutritional yeast provides a natural form of course if you get the version that vitamins but if you alcoholic you really need to increase this one right here okay nutritionally a lot of it okay next is fish and I talking about wild caught fish because of the omega-3 which is very anti-inflammatory so it inflammation and provide you with some really good quality proteins out of all the fish you want to do the fattier fish salmon and sardines alright number five large salads okay of course the salad could be cruciferous vegetables but sometimes people like to steam these but I always recommend doing like raw salads large salads that for the liver it will also provide you with vitamin C which is a very important antioxidant for your liver and it interesting because if you go to a restaurant I was at a restaurant a couple days ago and I and like no one is ordering salads except me and so they protein fat the carbs but no salads an average American consumes only 1.5 cups of salad per day so where are they going to get their vitamin C where are they gonna get their potassium large salads actually will help an alcoholic recover they want to do moderate protein large amounts of greens and generally nutrient-dense foods now for the inflammation that could be going on and for the cirrhosis they need to be doing in a minute fasting I have a video down below exactly how to do that one to two meals a day and make sure those meals are big enough so they between the meals so you want to do in a minute fasting with some periodic prolonged fasting why so you can create this condition called a Toph Ajit the tapa ji is like a self-cleaning oven it starts to clean up the old damaged proteins which you cirrhosis and help turn those into healthy new amino acids and that happens roughly about an 18 hour fast so if you were to do all mad one meal a day you would have enough at otha ji to really see some great great improvement but then if you were to end on top of that maybe every week or every two weeks a longer fast you would really speed up the results now kombucha tea is a really good product if you get the one with the lowest amounts of sugar to act as a substitute for beer or wine because the consistency of it is a kind of a thick carbonated beverage and it beverage where it can actually help relax the person and make them feel calmer so I do recommend that and it does have a small amount of alcohol like but it it you wanted to take it the next level these are the nutrients that I would recommend to help someone repair liver damage now what these nutrients do is they increase glutathione which is the most important antioxidant for the liver for repair and glutathione is the thing to actually speed up the toxic effective alcohol like when you have a hangover so it cleans up acetyl aldehyde which is the byproduct of alcohol what alcohol turns into in the liver so it cleans it up but the problem with taking glutathione directly sometimes is that it gets broken down and you don get the full benefit so I recommend taking the precursors cysteine glycine glutamine and AC these will really help and also vitamin C is needed to make glutathione and also zinc as well and zinc will also replace what you deficient in as well and you can get your B vitamins from nutritional yeast right here and milk thistle is one of the best herbs to support a healthy liver in addition this alone will increase glutathione so those are the things I would recommend for a recovering alcoholic so if you want more knowledge on how to create a

The Amazing Benefits of Alpha-Lipoic Acid	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGnzlkx1rcs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I want to talk about the benefits of alpha lipoic acid now what is alpha lipoic acid well your body makes it and you can get it as a supplement it certain foods as well it it you getting a lot more of it like a thousand times more of it than your body can make but alpha lipoic acid is a very powerful antioxidant and in your body you have networks of antioxidants so when one antioxidant does its job and it donates an electron to this free radical which is an unpaired electron so it stabilizes this free radical it will borrow an electron from another antioxidant so alpha lipoic acid is always helping other antioxidants like glutathione and vitamin E to help them recharge so it helps rejuvenate other antioxidants so antioxidants are scavengers for free radicals so they basically kind of the act as a sponge to soak up free radicals and so let for example you high levels of glucose alpha lipoic acid will protect the tissues from that or let mitochondria and you have this excess production of oxidation it gross alpha lipoic acid can help counter that so no matter if the oxidation is coming in from the outside as in certain types of chemicals or whatever or being produced by your own body from this own your own cells like in hydrogen peroxide or other types of compounds that give free radicals so this compound is designed to protect that oxidation from that now alpha lipoic acid it can also act as a key later to help detoxify mercury from the body now mercury in the body it will also produce oxidation and so will other heavy metals well alpha lipoic acid can help counter that and help to chelate it so it connect onto it or bind and pull it out of the body so it mercury detox and it really good for areas of your body that are aligned with lipids as in nerves the nerves are lined with a lipid or a fat layer called myelin so if someone has MS for example which is an autoimmune condition alpha lipoic acid would be really good to minimize the side effects from that condition it anything involving nerve damage I done other videos on other remedies like benfotiamine which is a type of that side will be one which is really good for peripheral neuropathies but if you were to add alpha lipoic acid with benfotiamine together and you had peripheral neuropathy you would feel really good really fast and fYI Germany has approved alpha lipoic acid for neuropathies for many many years so this compound counters oxidation free radicals it crosses the blood-brain barrier it protects the myelin sheath it also can help the mitochondria to make more energy so it has a lot of different functions some people take it to lower their a1c because it supports healthy blood sugars and the last thing is if you taking 600 milligrams three times a day don empty stomach it because it competes with food and I know some people are gonna ask what brand do I get I don recommendation on that you to do your own research so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success

What To Do After a Stroke: IMPORTANT	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOc-magAzx8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	all right today we about 7 things to do after someone experiences a stroke now what happens when you get a stroke is you get hypoxia so you have a blood clot in the brain and you start killing neurons so you damaged brain tissue so you have this lowered amount of oxygen that then causes the brain tissue the brain tissue is very sensitive to oxygen and it does not survive without oxygen in fact your brain only represents 2 percent of the tissue in your body but it uses 20% of the oxygen so you need oxygen to keep the brain going so what do you do for a stroke well the question is well how do you increase oxygen in the brain that what you need to focus on the single most important thing that I would recommend and to do this as quickly as possible is to do hyperbaric oxygen therapy because what they do is they combine pure oxygen well it like 99.5% oxygen under pressure so it pushes all this oxygen through your lungs up into the into the blood up into the brain so it can really help heal the damage after a stroke so this would be number one number two ketones now why do ketones help the brain well they actually give you more oxygen glucose does not give you as much oxygen as ketones and ketones are wonderful on providing an alternative fuel for especially a damaged brain now how do you do that exogenous ketones you can get these as supplements called ketone salts and I would consume these through the day so even if the person doesn change a diet which we recommend they do and they have higher glucose if there ketones in the blood because you took this the brain will use the ketones over the glucose MCT oil can also give you ketones going on a low-carb diet can give you more ketones and in a minute fasting can spike your ketone levels so all of these are essential if you had a stroke the worst thing to do is stick with the standard American diet and snack okay that would be the worst thing you can do DHA is also very important this is an omega-3 fatty acid and your brain needs that as a part of its structure this has been shown to help improve a damaged brain so I would consume a good amount of it vitamin D can help repair a damaged brain lots of exercise will flood the body in the brain with o2 and I would definitely want to include long walks low stress lots of oxygen very very important now there else that you may want to consider it is called acute intermittent hypoxia now this is interesting because you basically creating a hypoxic state with a very short period of time and then you because anytime you oxygen on a very short-term basis and then putting it back in you what you genes that increase the growth of brain tissue so the key the term is intermittent okay not a chronic state where you down the oxygen but just a little bit I mean there under hypoxic conditions when they training in high altitudes for example that then can strengthen their their circulation and their endurance yet there relationship to people who had strokes up and a link down below and the last thing is whole about M&C complex now normally vitamin C comes as a synthetic fraction of the entire complex but the entire vitamin C complex that has all the factors can help strengthen the blood vessels to prevent a stroke in the future especially when you with aneurysms and weaknesses within the blood vessel itself all right there you have it the seven things that a person should do after they experience a stroke so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
The Effects of Autophagy on Infection	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOwPN-_6cjg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today I effects of a toffee G on infections now you may have heard me talk about in other videos of Vltava G for recycling damaged proteins but there really cool thing about etapa G and it called xenophanes eat and that targets pathogen so your immune system will use this mechanism to clean up microbes that shouldn mold viruses and even Candida now it is true that unfortunately certain viruses especially have adapted to this and they have ways of evading this mechanism so you might not handle all your microbes in your body but it can definitely lessen the load so what is the Tov G for those people that are new it a condition where your body starts to eat up damaged protein and clean up microbes it shouldn recycle them into new amino acids and new materials and the way that you would trigger this state is to do fasting okay so you to start seeing some really good at ofuji etapa G is great for anti-aging it good to clean up old damage proteins that shouldn it whatever and what when someone to lose their appetite animals in the wild when they get an infection they stop eating and this could be the mechanism that helps them survive so etaf adji is an evolutionary pathway to help survival now if you channel I would highly recommend getting more information to how to do intermittent fasting correctly I put some links down below because it has lots of benefits that go way beyond just losing weight now this is the thing that I would recommend in addition to fasting if you infection or some type of chronic systemic immune weakness whether it viral infection that maybe keeps coming back over and over and over I would add some antiviral and anti-american ptosis very much maybe a few minutes if that so garlic that could be very very beneficial and I would take it in a little capsule form on an empty stomach and you can take any one of these right here or a few of these but you have garlic st. John and oregano my favorites are oregano and garlic and if you take these two on empty stomach I think that would actually really help to accelerate the process of dealing with the infection in addition to a fasting to stimulate a tapa gee thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
What Causes Low Blood Pressure? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNqSWV93anA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we the causes of low blood pressure now someone blood pressure but there becomes too low and you feel dizzy and you don gonna discuss the different reasons for that number one postural hypotension this is a condition where you stay end up too fast and you feel dizzy and you have to sit down a lot of people have experienced this especially if you let after you went for a jog and it was really hot outside so you dehydrated and let sleep that well and let before you went out drinking and you a little hungover well you gonna have this right here now what happening is a part of the nervous system called the autonomic nervous system is not adapting for this positional change when you stand up and you lose oxygen so some people can even faint now there of that called pots which I did a video on and I put a link down below and this is really low vitamin b1 and so I recommend the person taking higher amounts of b1 and that can greatly improve this and it also supports the heart as well because if your heart is weak that can actually cause low blood pressure and I put that down here and it just so happens and vitamin b1 is essential for keeping the heart working correctly if you even actually cause the heart to work harder and develop something called cardiomegaly which is enlarged heart but adrenal fatigue can definitely cause postural hypotension and even be behind pots because the adrenal is the stress gland and it adapts to all forms of stress including just a mild stress of standing up alright so now let the next one dehydration now I want to differentiate dehydration from low salt they however they can cross over now some people can be dehydrated without having a deficiency of salt because dehydration is really just they okay so it could happen when you exercise too much in heat but then again you depending on how much salt you have in your reserve it could be more or less or let you had vomiting or diarrhea or diuretics that can put you in a state of dehydration which you just need to drink more fluid and not having enough fluid can actually cause low blood pressure then we have a situation which is low salt and because we have low salt we not able to hold the fluid in the body and you you retain hopefully the right amount of fluid and so this could come from actually taking way too much potassium and not enough sodium it could also come from starting the ketogenic diet and you not putting back in the electrolytes in the fluid also exercising and just sweating out a lot of things electrolytes because when you sweat you then potassium but you are going to sweat out both of those electrolytes all right the next one is Addison a real severe adrenal condition it autoimmune where the adrenal glands are just not working anymore and you getting a massive sodium deficiency because the adrenals specifically aldosterone is needed to retain salt and so in these cases you need to be taking salt like all day long and part of this is related to anemia too so if you anemic you can have low blood pressure that could be loan iron it could be low b12 it could be other things as well then number seven postprandial that means after you eat the blood pressure drops now remember when I talked about the autonomic nervous system well in this situation the autonomic nervous system helps to control blood flow whether it digestive system or to the extremities when you weakness within the autonomic nervous system and you eat and all the blood is shunted to your digestive system and away from your brain you kind of dizzy when you eat and that just means you have a weakness within the autonomic nervous system if you have that situation I put a link down below for more information on what to do about it and then number 9 we already reviewed this anemia now one last thing about this postural hypotension there that per se but it issues okay and the autonomic nervous system so what you do is you take your blood pressure sitting down okay it should be 120 or 80 and then you take your blood pressure when you okay and you this test the top number it normally should go up to adapt for gravity stress right well if your adrenals are weak it to ten points then there issue with the adrenal gland because the adrenal gland is not adapting to that stress and then you can actually further investigate what could be behind that alright thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
Why Are Children So Vitamin D Deficient?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eFa99gmT7k	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I want to talk about why so many children have low vitamin D levels well the first reason is the invention of our friendly computers right there inside they don probably when you were a kid you were outside constantly so there you number two low fat foods generally speaking the high fat diet has not gone mainstream yet so people are still feeding their kids more low fat foods which basically have two point five times less vitamin D than higher fat foods number three grain fed meats farm-raised fish actually have lower amounts of vitamin D and before low magnesium in their diet where do you get magnesium from leafy greens vegetables kids are not consuming enough vegetable they gonna be deficient you need magnesium to absorb vitamin D all right number five sugar especially fructose degrades vitamin D number six asthma and allergies when you have these conditions you vitamin D and by taking vitamin D you can actually improve these conditions fYI and number seven a fatty liver so the less capacity of liver function the less amount of vitamin D you be able to process store and make enough bile to actually extract vitamin D from the food that you eat and you definitely gonna have a fatty liver if you are overweight and you can see in the last two decades the trend is kids are getting fatter and fatter and fatter and with that comes insulin resistance if you have instant resistance you will not be able to absorb vitamin D as well so that have a deficiency of vitamin D if you have children I would highly recommend that you start giving them some vitamin D you can even get it in a liquid form put some drops into their water and they don alright thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
Bogus Diagnosis Disorder	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6ZCH_KoFts	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we a new diagnosis and it diagnosis disorder we have the code right here the main symptom is the urge to make up and invent a mental illness and I authors of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for mental disorders the dsm-5 and you may not know this but they actually vote on certain diseases okay there subjective and sometimes you read this in the newspaper there epidemic of mental health problems right spreading all the country know there an epidemic of prescription drugs one out of six Americans take psychiatric drugs and the question is is it working are people getting healthier with their mental health actually know things are getting worse we substance abuse we rates of suicide but I want to share with you some very interesting scientific diagnoses that are in this book the first one is called borderline personality disorder okay this is a condition where you more emotion more intensely for a longer period of time like I don ever had a chronic feeling of boredom I mean I think that for everyone to experience certain times in their life and that illness but they say that we don the cause yet but we think it there problem with the environment but until we do research and really find the cause take an antidepressant all right next one separation anxiety disorder this occurs when you have a relationship or a marriage breakup okay I mean yous need to get over it faster or else you disorder and when you read down the list in this book it has a section on infants and they stated that infants show stranger anxiety stranger anxiety by crying when someone unfamiliar approaches I think that response to a stranger isn that communicate is through crying and apparently this condition starts when you I mean I determine that what tests have they used to scientifically prove that so you can take an indian person for that one and then we have caffeine withdrawal disorder first of all this is not a mental disorder this is a physical chemical imbalance okay all right here one premenstrual dysphoric disorder so when you go through your menstrual cycle you have a feeling of hopelessness or you have bloating in your lower abdomen okay this is hormonal this is not a mental disorder and is treated with an antidepressant it gets more hilarious check this out minor neurocognitive disorder this is a situation is as you get older you have a decline in cognitive function that beyond your normal age this is a physical problem okay this is probably the beginning of Alzheimer starts 25 years before you even have symptoms so this is a physical condition and they panty depressant all right next one is my favorite intermittent explosive disorder no you don have a temper tantrum or you start arguing verbal arguments and if you do that for two times a week for three months you you have a somatic symptom disorder this is extreme focus on the physical symptom mainly pain or fatigue I think I had this disorder when I was in my 20s because I was in pain and I was always tired and I was constantly focused on him this occurs when you have excessive thoughts on your symptoms so what you really should be doing is kind of ignoring them and not looking like you may be thinking I the diagnostic manual is this thick it filled with things like this and that leads to a lot of over medicated people and a lot of people that have been excessively over diagnosed if that even a word so here we have a situation of a somewhat of a normal behavior that that has side effects okay all of the psych drugs carry a was called a black box warning okay why do they have this because they have severe severe side effects that can create way worse symptoms and the symptoms that you trying to treat nausea insomnia impotence weight gain ejaculation disorder abnormal bleeding seizures visual problems increase risk of suicide are you kidding birth defects heart condition the FDA stated that they don recommend celexa if you have low blood sugar or low magnesium who doesn low magnesium and one of the last symptoms if you scroll down all the side effects is sudden death I guess people aren to actually really hear what they saying but I causes sudden death I don gonna take it so anyway in summary there mood for someone with diet that is something that is completely and utterly ignored healthy keto intermittent fasting B vitamins specifically vitamin b1 vitamin D are essential anyway put your comments below and tell me what your thoughts are on this topic so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
When NOT to Take Extra Vitamin D	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvA-wpmuaCI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now I importance of vitamin D and why you should take it and why people are deficient I needed to create an opposite video on when not to take vitamin D silly because there exception to the rule that being said I do want to mention that vitamin D from my viewpoint is the most important nutrient simply because it almost impossible to get from your diet and people are not outside anymore like they used to so they to get it from the Sun and the consequences of not having enough vitamin D for the immune system for your bones for your joints creating a whole back pain that being said there are certain conditions where you avoid taking vitamin D there only one side effect from taking excessive amounts of vitamin D and that would be hypercalcemia okay too much calcium in the blood simply because vitamin D helps you absorb calcium by 20 times in the intestines so if you calcium in the blood that could be a problem specifically for the kidney okay kidney stones out of all of these symptoms for hypocalcemia bone pain excessive urination muscle weakness right here and depression and anxiety kidney stones would be the most serious but since a kidney stone is really a supersaturated calcium deposit with some oxalates or uric acid if you were to consume 2 to 2.5 or more liters of fluid per day and keep your ox let low by avoiding almonds and spinach and have some lemon juice that would cut the risk way way down and the second thing I want to mention is these conditions that I where you sometimes you vitamin D because of this furnace right here but some doctors will put you in vitamin D they calcium in your blood which i think is a smart thing for example the first condition started which is a condition which involves along the skin the lymph nodes that can involve other organs where you have this these abnormal immune cells that are stuck in the lungs encapsulating foreign toxin or microbe or something but really in only four to seven percent of the cases they 100 percent of the cases and actually a very low percent of cases but it something you should look at if you have this condition and you D alright next condition is primary hyperparathyroidism this is a situation we have a tumor affecting the parathyroid and that of parathyroid hormone which is dumping a lot of calcium into the body so you can actually have this condition right here and it could end up in the kidney as well so you just want to be aware of taking too much vitamin D or any vitamin D if you have this condition all right number three this is a rare genetic disease which I probably shouldn put on the list because it I wanted to just mention it familial hypocalcemic hypercalcemia in this condition you have hyper too much calcium okay and so that would be one condition we you would want to avoid vitamin D before lithium can have an effect of creating excessive calcium in the blood so that is another thing on the list okay number five diuretics specifically hydrochlorothiazide so the problem is as you get rid of the fluid you can also get rid of calcium which could end up in your kidney so if you take more calcium it calcium to go in the blood and end up in the kidney potentially but it something to know about okay number six certain cancers will cause hypercalcemia and number seven if you have a hyper thyroid condition where your thyroid is working too much that could dump a lot of calcium into the blood as well so realize these are the things that occur very rarely but the most common thing is someone has a deficiency but this is the main problem and some of the symptoms that could potentially happen with this could be kidney stones bone pain excessive urination muscle weakness and depression alright thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success

Dr.Berg Explains 11 Causes of Depression	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axsfoQ6mvFk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let depression I interesting book by Kelly Brogan MD amazing credentials she psychiatrist and this is what she said there is not one study that proves that depression is a chemical imbalance people are taught we yeah you have depression you have a chemical imbalance just take this drug it later they still have the depression and they medications or they might say it genetic you have the gene for depression which is absolutely not true it been proven it epigenetics are those factors that control your genes a lot of its environment the food that you the nutrition that can affect the genes so let depression number one low vitamin D this is why people in the winter a lot of times get the blues because they don get much Sun vitamin D can greatly help someone depression number two low vitamin b12 now our bodies store b12 for up to a year but at some point if you consuming animal products or you have a problem in your gut and you run out of b12 you neurological problems from that but you can get depression number three Mohs ink or low chromium you can get both of these trace minerals from shellfish a lot of people when they consume shellfish just feel better it brings their mood up and that reasons why number four low blood sugar or high blood sugar but if you have low blood sugar chances are you can have high insulin that you can actually have depression from low blood sugars or high blood sugar or normal blood sugars because you have insulin resistance this is why keto and intermittent fasting are very important when you do intermittent fasting you can greatly elevate the moon and when you do the ketogenic diet and you great mood stabilizers and also ketones feed the brain all right number five lack of sleep and when I depression I hopelessness or apathetic you don anymore anxiety is different anxiety is more like I about problems and I don solution to that that fatigue so many people that are depressed actually are physically exhausted and guess what that will make you depressed being tired will give you the sensation of depression it difficult to be depressed a huge full of energy this is why sleep is very very important alright number seven postpartum you just gave birth and now you estrogen okay I put a link down below of another video that I did to increase estrogen and you can watch that if you just had a baby and you alright number eight you through your menstrual cycle and at some point during that period of time you get depressed same thing it now number nine you medication that and one of the side effects is depression now the problem with certain psychiatric medication is they inhibit certain neurotransmitters like serotonin so they caused this recycling effect so they prevent the loss of that neurotransmitter the problem is over time your receptors downgrade that means you need a little more medication to create the same effect and over time you need more and more and more and the side effects go higher and higher and next thing you know you need another medication and another medication and you effects and more side effects alright number 10 you have stress due to a loss let well guess what depression is a normal response to a loss if you weren depressed that would be a problem okay so this is normal 11 invite mental situation you ongoing situation a problem that you can because of that so the best thing to do for these situations is to make sure your sleep is good that way your energy will be up make sure you have enough vitamin D and b12 and trace minerals and definitely get on keto and especially in a minute fasting all right thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success

Can the Ketogenic Diet Cause Brain Tumors (Glioblastomas)?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeyvWykx2l0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so is the ketogenic diet now causing brain tumors now recently there was a study done on the ketogenic diet increasing tumor growth specifically the growth of glioblastoma which is a specific type of aggressive tumor that grows in the brain and I want to discuss the study so I reached out to Professor Thomas Seyfried to get his opinion on it and I copied his response in the description below the entire thing so you can check it out this abstract or data about this study was presented before the peer review okay so that point number one so it really wasn reviewed before it was published and if you don Seyfried he is a professor when researching cancer for decades at Boston College and he is author of this book cancer as a metabolic disease an amazing amazing book the research that he is doing using the ketogenic diet with fasting is amazing and it away I put some links down below so you can get more data on that so the success rate on different types of cancer including glioblastoma is remarkable but what I want to talk about is basically the most important factor it of mice that they use in the study it was a u-87 - mg xenograft Mouse okay specifically n OD s CI D what does it stand for non obese diabetic severely compromised immuno deficiency mice that chose a type of mouse that has no relevance to either normal humans or normal mice at all what important to mention is not only do these mice have compensated innate and or adapted immune systems okay there two parts of the immune system that we have innate and they adapted well they had weaknesses within both parts okay but they also Express characteristics of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and then he also mentioned these findings are inconsistent with other studies that show opposing data so how they recommend that you read the entire correspondence because the news will take this and blast it out there and distort it and people won understand the study they won study they don mice that have nothing to do with our human bodies okay they don research of Professor c3 what they gonna look at is this and that to discourage them from doing the exact diet that is going to help them avoid cancer or tumors in the future and I also put a link down below of an interview that I did with Professor Seyfried when he gets into the actual cause of cancer itself and it has to do with the mitochondria the respiration or the normal machinery that burns fuel is altered to a completely different mechanism because cancer cells ferment glucose they also ferment glutamine but mainly glucose and they do this anaerobically or without oxygen so when the mitochondria get damaged the cell to survive flips to a different type of machinery that can burn a different type of fuel and that happens to be the mechanism for cancer which he talks about extensively in this book right here and you so it just makes logical sense oh it running on glucose so let right and there glutamine that he which is the type of amino acid and that is why you would want to do low-carb keto within a minute fasting so we can then have the combination of lowering the glucose and that specific type of amino acid so anyway I wanted to point this out you do not have to worry about the ketogenic diet causing brain tumors unless you are a non obese diabetic severely compromised immuno deficiency Mouse thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
How to Fix Your Low Estrogen Levels	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkThAmV1M8Y	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now in the past i videos on what to do for estrogen dominance but in this video we to talk about what to do if you are low on estrogen okay let postmenopausal or you just have low estrogen these are the some of the symptoms hot flashes thinning hair breast atrophy vaginal dryness depression utis loss of collagen so you do not want to do a low fat diet you want to do the ketogenic diet that a higher fat diet cholesterol is needed to make estrogen all right number two boron this is a trace mineral which is very very important in maintaining normal cholesterol levels and boron will just help balance estrogen whether it too high it needs to come down or too low and needs to be brought up all right herbal remedies that will increase estrogen black cohosh fennel wild yam and a very special herb from thailand pereira marifika all right next thing is fasting in a low-carb diet why because fasting and low-carb diet lower insulin now what insulin will increase androgens in a female body and indirectly lower estrogen so if you eat very frequently and you do a lot of snacks and you diet that all right next one is vitamin e why is that so important because out of all the glands in your body the pituitary needs a lot of vitamin e especially after menopause so if you in vitamin e you may not produce the hormones that signal the ovaries and the adrenal to make estrogen if you sure it you want the tocopherol and tocatrino complex together this can actually greatly help someone next thing is adjust your stress levels if you have high levels of stress you have high levels of cortisol that is a hormone that will just shut this right down because realize that during menopause the adrenal glands are supposed to back up the ovaries they make the same hormones but just in smaller amounts so if your adrenal glands are already stressed and weakened going in the menopause they be magnified and the same part of the gland and the adrenals that make cortisol also make estrogen so the bottom line is lowering your stress is going to help you make more estrogen because the adrenal glands will be able to work better and lastly you have to adjust your exercise and make sure you training if you recovering that alone will shut down estrogen so the key is making sure you recovering and make sure you don train some people do very well on one to two workouts a week and as soon as they do three or even four their body breaking down they and their estrogen will plummet all right there you go these are the things that can help you increase your estrogen levels so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
The Benefits of Intermittent Hypoxic Training (IHT)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QVPkrYO57g	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I about something actually very fascinating you may have never heard about this before but it intermittent hypoxic training okay so we intermittent hypoxic training or therapy all right what is this well it training or therapy very similar to training in high altitudes you your body lower amounts of oxygen and this is the key term intermittently okay because if you cut down the oxygen too low too long it can be dangerous just like fasting is really good short term but not for two years so by giving your body a little doses of hypoxia a lack of oxygen you can create an amazing adaptation some of the videos I recently we more oxygen right this is about taking the oxygen away a lot of the top athletes do this type of training to get the unfair advantage number two chronic lung diseases doing this training at the right intervals under supervision can increase your oxygen carrying capacity greatly number three bronchial asthma and by the way both of these right here would benefit greatly from vitamin D as well okay number four hypertension five diabetes number six brain damage let had Parkinson this training can cause your body to just carry more oxygen and feed the areas that are hypoxic number seven radiation toxicity number eight increasing of your antioxidant Network when you put your body in a hypoxic state it starts to rebound and starts creating antioxidants like crazy number nine it increases the number of mitochondria Wow number ten and actually I think this is the most amazing thing it will increase not only the number of red blood cells but the size of your red blood cells so you can carry more oxygen so you this is amazing number 11 it helps release excessive amounts of calcium from the cell number 12 it your tissues is probably why it helps diabetes asthma and brain damage and number 13 it decreases oxidative stress all right so how do you do it you can get a device like this which is a little mask over your mouth right here where you can breathe and you probably can hear me but basically this restricts air and you can use different settings that will simulate different altitudes so maybe you start at 3,000 feet and you slowly go up to 19,000 feet and you mimicking the amount of oxygen at different altitudes and there ways to do it too one way is like you on this bicycle and you less amount of oxygen and more nitrogen to create the same effect so one pattern might look like between three to five minutes of hypoxic air where you breathing more co2 and then two to five minutes of ambient normal air back and forth for let what you can do is you can get a pulse oximeter they can get them from Amazon and that measure the amount of oxygen in your blood as your feedback mechanism now before I did hyperbaric my oxygen was 95 and now it doing this training it temporarily but then it goes right back up to where you were so this is just another tool that you can use to create a hormetic effect which basically you giving a small amount of stress and tremendous body to rebound and adapt and become even stronger alright thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
What Causes Nosebleeds/Epistaxis Â 8 Common Causes of Nose Bleeding Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJs0ZHwfCpc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let may experience a nosebleed now just because you start bleeding from your nose doesn it most common type of cancer that causes a nosebleed would be the squamous cell carcinoma let things low vitamin k1 vitamin k1 has to do with clotting stopping you from bleeding where do you get vitamin k1 these things called vegetables okay let diet you could be deficient in k1 number 2 liver damage in the liver you have all these different clotting factors so if there is damage like cirrhosis or maybe a fatty liver you might not have the function to help you with those clotting factors low months of biome biome is produced by the liver it gallbladder it helps you to break down fats in your diet and help extract the fat soluble vitamins and guess what vitamin k1 is one of them so if you don don some type of problem where you don have enough bile that could be a cause or if you which is coumadin this is a blood thinner that is used to prevent clots a lot of times if someone has atrial fibrillation they are taking this to thin the blood to prevent a stroke but the function of this is to block vitamin k1 it rat poison which basically causes the rat to bleed internally and die however when you taking large amounts to create that same effect okay number two sinus irritation from either an allergy or some type of virus or infection this is very very common it on the mucous membranes and that can create a little bleeding number three high blood pressure if you have high blood pressure and you have at the same time some fragile capillaries in your sinuses that can create a nosebleed now number four liver disease I already talked about that but that controls the clotting factors but if the liver is damaged you platelets and platelets are those things in your blood that helps you clot so one cause of lower amounts of platelets would be if you had leukemia which is a cancer of the blood or anemia or a decrease in vitamin b12 or iron or ful late or you have Epstein Barr virus or some other virus that can cause low platelets as well or let or you have liver cirrhosis those are some things that can cause decrease platelets number five over-the-counter medications like aspirin and Tylenol that will definitely thin your blood number six cocaine number seven sulfite base preservatives they put sulfates and a lot of different foods I put a link down below on the video on sulfides but it in wine it a preservative and sulfites can irritate the sinuses and create nosebleeds and number eight lastly already mentioned this but cancer but again this is very very rare so if you have a nosebleed kind of scan down to find out which one of these is responsible for it thanks for watching so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success

Rid Your Back Fat: The Fastest Way	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_51QZsORXg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys I show you the fastest way to get rid of your back fat and these are the most important things can you take awhile guess what you fasting hands down is the most powerful tool to get rid of very resistant stubborn fat especially on your back now there fat in your liver you have a fat in the visceral area around the abdomen okay then you have what subcutaneous fat and that is the fat that skin so that is the pizza crust that you might have on the front that wraps right around the back now this is the first thing to go away then this and lastly this right here and this is why it frustrating for some people that so hard and they still are not able to get rid of this back fat but I show you how to do it so realize that fasting will actually increase your metabolism fasting will normalize insulin and insulin resistance so if you have a stubborn metabolism over time fasting will correct it so if we took the ketogenic diet and you just did this okay and you did not fast you may not ever get rid of your back fat or even the fat around your lower part of your stomach and it really depends on the frequency of your meal so if you doing snacks between the meal but it still keto you still may have a problem especially if you have a slow metabolism now some people will be able to lose that extra fat but most people will not so if we compare keto with them fasting and fasting is actually more important however if you combine them you even better results so I that you that being said 80% of the population if they did fasting for 18 hours would be able to get rid of their back that over a period of time so let example they skip their breakfast their first meal is at 12:00 and their second meal at 6 that will give you an 18 hour window so this should work for the majority of the population ever if you work on you hours up to 23 hours okay so 23 hours would give you like a 1 hour of eating that but between 20 hours and 23 hours so let breakfast lunch and you ate at 3 o and then you next meal it was at 7 o window and that will give you 20 hours of fasting that would be very very powerful yet some people need to take it to the next level and fast all the way to this one meal a day which could be at 6 it could be at 5 it could be at 7 it could be 8 it doesn that you fast for 23 hours ok and you will lose the fat in the liver first visceral fat and then subcutaneous fat realize this won get rid of the fat around the liver so you might not see anything visibly for a bit but it time just have patience that you a patient and we put you in the waiting room now what are you gonna be consuming when you you can do some tea you can do some coffee I would recommend just a little tiny bit of cream okay not too much I would also recommend because you going to be eliminating a lot of fluid and electrolytes to add the electrolytes back in and some B vitamins to nutritional yeast I would also recommend some apple cider vinegar that would speed things up with some lemon juice you can do real lemons and roughly about 2 litres of fluid especially when you starting out because you lose a lot of fluid and don little bit of sea salt will be very very beneficial and lastly there couple other things you can do to speed things up you can start bringing your carbs down below 10 grams I a link down below of a video that I did entitled keto on steroids okay so that will actually help you understand what this means right here and then you can add exercise now you would think exercise would be the most thing it see people at the gym all the time that are working out like crazy and they they all have the pizza crust that they is all sugary or the exercise protein bar before during and after they workout and they with carbs so exercise typically will give you like fifteen percent of the results and that carbs because the carbs that you eat will nullify the exercise results however if you combine the fasting with keto and then add some exercise in here and ideally you would add in a pretty hardcore workout maybe a couple times a week a full body workout we multiple muscle groups cuts called compound resistance that would be really really important but just make sure you don down your progress I out I daily yeah no weight loss they overtraining and the last thing I would do if if you it need to cut down your fat to about 70 grams simply because we want to force your body to burn and live off your own fat not the dietary fat as much you don grams would be perfect alright go ahead and try this and then put your comments down below thanks for watching so I back with a quick video to show you the absolute fastest way to get rid woops just oh my gosh so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
The Sodium-Potassium Ratio is More Important Than a Low Sodium Diet	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4MFnrMpzBA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I want to talk about the sodium-potassium ratios that we need typically a person thinks of sodium being dangerous to the heart blood pressure and can even increase the risk of getting a stroke but the question is is it the higher amount of sodium or is it the deficiency of potassium now I going to put some links down below that talk about potassium being protective against strokes the kidney the heart in potassium actually lowering blood pressure so what than these two minerals is the ratio they come in normally you would need 4700 milligrams for potassium and 2300 for sodium and an average person has them flipped and that put them in trouble so ideally you would need two to one but if there an imbalance or you have a problem with the heart or blood pressure I would raise potassium three to one or even a four to one ratio but it does take a period of time to correct this it could take months or even a couple years but the more sodium that you have in the diet the lower the potassium so they kind of work in opposites now what interesting is one ounce of bread contains 210 milligrams of sodium two tablespoons of salad dressing at the grocery store can give you over 500 milligrams of sodium six ounces of pizza that thousand milligrams of sodium right there eight ounces of v8 will give you over a thousand milligrams and one little can of tomato soup is one thousand two hundred and sixty milligrams of sodium that amount of sodium with the carbohydrates okay so not only do we have more sodium we have more carbs and the carb depletes potassium plus the sodium we use in carbohydrates are not in the form of sea salt it so you don involved sea salt has 84 minerals table salt has these foods usually have MSG monosodium glutamate which is additional sodium that they don there so in America we on the sodium the carbs and very low on potassium so this is the perfect chemistry to set someone up for high blood pressure and eventual cardiovascular problems so the point of this video is to understand that these ratios of potassium sodium are more important than these minerals individually as long as you two to one ratio you and if you want to correct it go up to a 3 to 4 to 1 ratio and that faster if you have a lot of potassium in the diet you don better make sure that your sodium is very very low as well so you can keep these ratios in check so if you want more knowledge on how to create a healthy body subscribe now and get daily notifications	Success
Does Eating Yeast Really Cause Yeast Infections or Candida Infections? - Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbjvV3pUktM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey Dr Burg here in this video we going to talk about a myth that you probably heard that if you eat yeast you to avoid uh eating mushrooms because they have toenail fungus or they going to avoid consuming um apple cider vinegar or vinegar because they think they from that that is a myth there is such a thing as a good yeast and a bad yeast and even if we take candida for example candida can be totally harmless in the body and if there unfriendly yeast coming in the body that can turn against you and create problems so there even kind of neutral and they can go either side depending on the environment um kefir for example is a type of a sour yogurt it um um Dairy that is really the only thing that I know that will help get rid of uh certain types of candida stuff so you have to actually consume the good yeast to destroy the bad yeast because they kefir at the health the store make sure that you don the flavored yogurts get the actual plane and the other thing too it difficult to find you try to find yogurt and it it yogurt and kefir that is way way better grass-fed is even better but um yeah that fat is very very very beneficial to your body um so there different types of microbes in the body you have friendly bacteria friendly yeast friendly fungus all those microbes um help protect you against the unfriendly fungus or unfriendly yeast so if you have fungus growing on your skin or your toenails we know um that you don gut to be able to counter that so and I use Liquid U alive probiotic Flora it a liquid probiotic that I take on a regular basis just to counteract that it yeast and friendly uh bacteria so fermented foods do not worsen the situation and I know there a book out called the Candida diet it filled with false information it true you these foods are very very beneficial uh so so fermented foods would be like sauerkraut uh kimchi um apple cider vinegar um um yogurt kefir those are really good for your digestive system fermented foods are foods that are enhanced nutritionally they easier to break down because they have certain things in them like lactic acid which our bodies really need um so they there over a 100 trillion different microbes um living on your body and you only have um I trillion I got to I have to add a zero to that uh a thousand trillion microbes living on your body and you have 100 trillion cells so these microbes are by a factor of 10 times more than we actually have cells so they living in the the inside of your body in your mouth and your esophagus they align everything uh and so don consuming yeast like nutritional yeast for example or kefir or fermented foods because it could be very beneficial on the unfriendly side all right so hope that helped I will see you in the next one	Success
Calcium and Osteoporosis Â Calcium Might Cause a Heart Attack Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJfn32avPO0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey this is Dr Berg again in this short video we and osteoporosis uh this is the loss of bone and there osteopenia which is the kind of the precursor or the thing that happens just before osteoporosis um there is a myth going around that um women get osteoporosis because they the big huge uh trials that were just done the research on uh women that take calcium just found out that um the more calcium they take the more they get heart attacks yeah especially if they postmenopausal and I why that is um but most osteoporosis is not a calcium problem per se it is a problem with cortisol cortisol is a stress hormone that is made by your adrenal glands and if your adrenal glands are overactive and the way they be overactive is is especially during menopause because the adrenals back up the ovaries during menopause because they make estrogen so yes estrogen can infect osteoporosis but just the fact that the adrenals can difference from what the OV when the OV was producing before so we have these weak adrenals you go through menopause and then you lose your bones it because you it the adrenals are so tired they failing to back up the ovaries okay now what happens is when you have high cortisol it protein in the bone so you lose protein most of your bone is protein and it very destructive on calcium as well so you lose calcium you lose protein you lose other minerals and you lose your vitamin D levels I would say most of the vitamin D deficiencies in the United States uh especially in the northern version uh because they don adrenal High cortisol that become low low in vitamin D okay all right so cortisol that what this comes down to stress stress will cause high cortisol so I live on a go live on a desert island by yourself I taking calcium start to do things to start to improve the stress situation and change your environment um do things that are um less stressful um work on your adrenals nutritionally uh acupressure uh go for long walks there to lower cortisol so it problem directly uh Studies have shown that higher calcium and I will put the studies below so you can look them up yourself and just to realize I making this up um high high levels of calcium will double the ch chance of getting a heart attack and why is that why because when you take calcium calcium needs a transporter vitamin there are two transporter vitamins one is vitamin D which transports the calcium into the blood but there vitamin K2 that transports calcium from the blood all the way into the tissues the function of vitamin K2 is to mobilize the calcium out of the arteries and out of the soft tissue and put it in the bone vitamin K2 is in a lot of the fats it yolks it the things that the doctors tell you not to consume if you have a heart problem right well we need K2 you can get this um in a tablet form take 100 micro grams and you can then also take vitamin D3 I would take 10,000 international units together these two together with a little fish oil maybe codiv oil so if you took all three these together um this would be very very beneficial to protect your bones why because this is going to transport it this will help to um transport it as well and then of course I you not to neglect cortisol fix this too but these are very good protective vitamins to help transport calcium the other thing is um just by lowering cortisol your vitamin D3 will go up as well um but this is very beneficial now if you already have osteoporosis you going to need to take some calcium I do not recommend taking calcium carbonate if you your bottle right now and look at the label make sure it carbonate that better off chewing on the cement outside it need calcium citrate calcium lactate calcium gluconate all the different types of calcium but not carbonate but if you have osteoporosis you might want to add calcium to this and that would be like your your bone uh building factors and to prevent the heart attacks um the last point I wanted to make is that um is this many people ask me like what food can I can I get these vitamins it difficult to get vitamin D from food um unless you consume Civ oil um but you can get it from the Sun so if you go outside 10 minutes a day or 15 you can get 10,000 iuse so that way it free you don definitely the K2 that you want to take more of to help prevent this and again check with your doctor if you have this I you that this is going to cure you or diagnose this is the the reason why you have osteoprosis but I some extra data to present to your doctor so you guys can figure it out but it takes if you have ostosis it does take a bit of time to have that be restored it could take several years because it the body when you have osteoporosis your body has been very very very um healthwise been way way down so give it time it months it but this will help you hope you enjoyed the video I	Success
What Causes Upper Arm Fat? Losing Fat From Arms Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIyNBO8-KTg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey Dr bur here in this short video I going to talk about upper arm fat um I wrote a book on body types we talked I created uh the body type system of weight loss and but I have not mentioned people that gain weight in the upper part of the body so I on that now just to quickly review there pot belly where the person has a protruding internal pushing out force that would be more liver because there fluid that is in there there uh and then there high adrenal cortisol stress hormone situation that you have the person with fa uh weight in the hip the thighs and the butt that the lower part of the body that estrogen dominant situation and then the other one is the thyroid body type which would be the person that gains weight all over now by talking to a lot of people um that have upper arm fat I always ask them when did it start okay because there association between upper arm fat and increased breast tissue as well and so every single person that I talked to that has upper arm has hip thighs and butto Ock as well so they kind of mimic a thyroid body type but it really have any thyroid symptoms so the real reason why people have upper arm fat is the estrogen dominant that it is so if the person tends to get their cycle more balanced that would help that so anything that supports the menstrual cycle to help balance estrogen get on that kale shake that I recommend kale and frozen fruit start blending it up in the morning avoid soy um and also anything related to um estrogen like in the food supply buy more hormone free Meats uh especially Dairy and also butter those have to be organic and even the eggs um if we want to help reduce estrogen and that will improve the situation so that estrogen dominance	Success
The Best Liver Cleansing Foods Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekN-SSAtUYg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hello everyone Dr Berg here in this video we foods to clean the liver okay the to make your liver happy all right so now the first thing I want to mention is the liver is the only internal organ that can completely 100% regenerate and all you need is 25% of your liver left to be able to do that that takes 3 and a half years of healthy eating to do it now the best foods hands down of anything that you can possibly eat for your liver would be the cruciferous vegetables so first of all the word cruciferous comes from the plant which means cross Cru so it has a little cross on the leaves that examples of cruciferous vegetables would be kale um collard greens cabbage broccoli brussels sprouts radish all those wonderful bitter vegetables okay so those those vegetables um are not very uh popular among a lot of people they um on the plate is like you have the kale leaf or you have this little um parsley that plate so the thing about cruciferous is that not only does do they have the most macronutrients like vitamins and minerals and amino acids and trace minerals but they have something very very unique called phytonutrients and um if you want to know some of the names probably put you to sleep of the indol 3 sulfuranes lycopenes isoflavonoids all those chemical names but those are names that describe these plant-based chemicals called phytonutrients that give very unique health benefits now I can this video tell you that consuming those vegetables or any supplement is going to cure any diseases but I will say that you should just go out yourself and look at the research that in Mass amounts showing you that consuming these vegetables will decrease the risks of all sorts of cancers diseases macular degeneration and act as a protective mechanism um so they very very very important to consume and there and that shake you take kale and blueberries and blend it up and drink it down every day I hope you these cruciferous vegetables have very very unique properties now they have some really cool things that they do to the liver and by the way the liver is on the right side of your body 3 and 12 lbs the size of a football it functions the liver um makes protein on your body it basically controls the blood sugars it stores sugar it controls detoxification it stores fat cable vitamins it makes certain hormones insulin like uh growth factor that fat burning hormone it also controls growth hormone too so that very important organ the problem with the liver is that a lot of um issues with the liver will not show up until 95% of that liver is destroyed and then it really can liver um you have to do you know biopsies which is really not good to do but if you have a pot belly I know your liver is a fatty liver because I took five of my patients and I sent them to the radiologist for ultrasounds and they had kind of like a protruding gut and all five out of five had fatty livers and um I in the past just to get a double check on that and a lot of them have fatted livers so you may have a fat liver and not even know it so what I is start consuming those Foods immediately because they good at help dissolving the fat and also protecting your health down the road the liver is such a Hub of Health I mean you fact the thyroid uses the liver to convert T4 to T3 so without the liver working you can hormone so again it and detoxification so many things the thing that the cruciferous vegetables do which is very unique is that they um stimulate certain enzymes in the liver that are responsible for something called Phase 1 Phase 2 detoxification you know if you were to do a cleanse and with a Herbal Cleanse or maybe some other type of cleanse a lot of times you get sick you feel the detox but when you do it with cruciferous vegetables you will not feel any detox and the reason why is it goes through phase one phase 2 detoxification so phase one is breaking down poisons or toxins that are stored in the liver and into smaller particles and then phase two takes it from that level all the way down to elimination completely so it cruciferous vegetables are responsible for breaking these poisons into harmless particles that will not cause any detoxification so that we live in a toxic waste dump and welcome the planet Earth and so when you consuming these foods thank goodness they actually help us they help cleanse and clean without the feeling of being sick okay so for those of you that are planning and doing a diet or a cleanse starting January 1st uh I recommend that you use my chapter 10 it liver enhancement it um it also comes together with a program of another product that I have which is the cruciferous so I have my own product a lot of you are already taking it but it in this product it has 250 capsules and it all organic organic brussels sprouts sprouts um cauliflower asparagus kale parsley parsley has more vitamin A than kale yeah but it to eat it that pill form red radish cabbage garlic hands down garlic is the best thing for almost any viral stuff anything I mean it turmeric and organic seelp why because when you consume certain cruciferous vegetables sometimes they can pull out um iodine so this puts it right back in so this is the like the ultimate product um and for the holidays I right here so normally it I be $24.95 which is a pretty good price for 250 capsules this will last you if you took six of these a day it for 41 days okay so that for doing a cleanse okay so here coupon code to get the

Most Pain is Referred Pain Â Explained By Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GHVuUnX0H4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys today we referred pain now what is referred pain basically it a different location than you hurt so for example if you step on a dog he you they but for this video I use a volunteer here so Jared thank you for coming up here all right I tell you what let okay Wow looks like I didn that right they there okay the first thing is the pancreas the pancreas is an organ let is right underneath the left ribcage right through here and it comes actually even crosses over sometimes so it right here if you have inflammation in your pancreas it can be referred to the left shoulder or the back okay right through in here or it doesn necessarily have to be referred it could just hurt right over the pancreas right there now the gallbladder which is the opposite side right underneath the ribcage right through in here will usually refer pain to the shoulder area right through here there muscle called the levator angle a scapula muscle and it just kind of want a massage on the right trap but it muscle right through and here that raises up the shoulder like this and that be a tight not to be painful this is gallbladder for sure and also be the what little nerve that goes underneath the diaphragm okay and that nerve is called the phrenic nerve and it goes all the way to the neck the cervical vertebra like see three four and five so some of these nerve roots make up something called the phrenic nerve so you can have pain in the right side of your neck right through in here it can even refer to the right temple through here and the jaw and cause a headache on this side pain could be right through in here okay and you can even create tension in your neck and pull out the vertebra to one side and pinch the nerve and cause pain anywhere down the right arm I the time even to the fingers right through now the liver is right through in here if the liver is inflamed or congested or not working that can cause pain also in the right shoulder but primarily it going to be in this muscle right through in here the rhomboid on the right side now over here we have the spleen which is just underneath the ribcage so the pancreas and the spleen is right here that can cause pain on the left shoulder right through in here and the heart is just off the midline right through in here and by the way the hearts the size of your fist and that will cause pain down the left arm right through here it can cause pain in the shoulder or even the jaw on this side now put your finger on your belly button okay good so his prostate is right down here that can refer pain to the back side now if you had ovaries what will happen is it just to the left or just to the right of the of that area right here that will cause pain in what sacroiliac joints so the sacroiliac joints on the right side on the left side there are little joints that connect the pelvic bone to the sacrum right here so to be right here and right here so if you have pain on the right side your female that would be the right ovary paying the left side right here that could be the left ovary and if you the pain can be right in the lower back right through in here now there something called sciatica pain and that is pain that runs down the back of the leg and go all the way to the lower part of the foot that nerve either in your back or one of the muscles in your butt you have several muscles there and one is called the piriformis and that can go into a spasm and tighten up the nerve and cause sciatic pain on that side sonic pain usually comes from either a tailbone injury some injury to the lower back or prolonged sitting where you lose the curve of your lower back in which case you need to actually put that curve back in and the last organ we about is the kidney okay so the kidneys are located here in here okay and the kind of the upper abdomen deep inside so in the back if you have 12 vertebra right through in here and you have the 12th rib the kidneys are like just right underneath that right here and right here so if there with the kidney whether it stone or inflammation your kidney you can have pain anywhere underneath the last 12th rib to the spine it here somewhere in the upper back on this side or this side right here now if there from either kidney that goes down to through the little tube called the ureter on its way to the bladder this would cause pain in the groin area so the problem is not in the groin it actually in the ureter that little tube there now the thing to know about referred pain is they don about what causes referred pain where it could be some type of problem with the nerve circuitry or some soft tissue whether it be fossa or ligament or a tendon or muscle so the next point I want to talk about is what percentage of the population has referred pain versus pain that actually is coming from the actual pain source so the answer to that is it to say that 50 60 percent of the pain that an average person has is referred from another area of the body especially if you hadn an area and you start hurting for no reason then suspect it could be referred now there things that you need to do if you have referred pain obviously involves an organ and that organ usually has a problem because the person good so you can treat this area over and over and over and even get rid of the pain but it until you fix the diet now if you new to my channel you know what the solution is but if you are someone that is new to the channel there you need to do healthy keto and in a minute fasting both of these actions together can help clean up these organs and actually help to give them a rest because you minute fasting and you the inflammation is going to go way down the organ is going to eventually heal and you as far as myself I head right shoulder pain for 12 years and I did not make the connection between my gallbladder and this right shoulder I would get massages I would get chiropractic treatments and it would last for a nanosecond and it kept coming back little did I know it was related to my diet and after I eventually found you know in a minute fasting and did that I right shoulder for years but usually the person will swear it was from an old injury that they had and that responsible for it but it related to their diet so if you on healthy keto and in a minute fasting do yourself a favor and try it and see how much it can help you and the very last thing I want to say is that if you go to a practitioner and you get treated and you need repeated treatments over and over and over for months and months and months suspect that there is this situation going on in your body and isolate the area that you have focus on that and ignore this because this is the symptom this is the cause all right thanks for watching and if you haven already subscribed click the red button below and that little bell icon so you can be

Do This For Instant Chronic Pain Relief Â Manage Chronic Pain Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwQfb_ZBBy0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys I talk about chronic pain now being in practice for 29 years being a chiropractor I come in with pain I of thousands of people come in with acute pain and most of them had chronic pain whether it the knee the hip back the shoulder the elbow neck head abdomen it could be in a rib anywhere in the body so I have a lot of experience dealing with chronic pain and I powerful things that you can do if you have chronic pain but before we get into it I want to make sure that you click the red subscribe button so you could be notified of all the very cool videos that I weeks and in addition to that you notified of the live Q&A sessions I be doing throughout the week okay so one of the most common reasons why people have chronic pain is post surgery and post injury when you get a surgery whether it or the shoulder you can develop scar tissue that can come back to haunt you years later if you have an injury same thing happens the body heals with scar tissue if I wasn now I would have chronic pain really bad because I I treated people that were in serious motorcycle accidents that were going very fast and then hit a car hit something and basically survived but they are living with chronic pain I had other people parachute for example and the chute one guy is chute didn even open and he landed in the trees can you imagine the trauma from that I had people come in with tailbone injuries that created all sorts of back pain one guy was filling up his tank with gasoline and he did not put the car in park so as his car rolled away because apparently it was on a hill he tried to stop it and his foot got caught underneath the tire and he ran over his ankle and he had chronic pain for over six years and you can also have pain that is inflamed for example that can cause pain in the right shoulder and I video that I just did on this so you can get more data on a referral pain diabetics have chronic pain especially in the feet in the hands you can have chronic pain from having an autoimmune condition whether it arthritis or lupus there different types of autoimmune conditions that cause pain because autoimmune is about inflammation and when inflammation builds up that can cause pain and then we have arthritis or severe stiffness now as far as chronic pain goes there not a lot of exact knowledge on why people develop chronic pain now there are some theories out there but it exactly known why but what I talk about and what I is my opinion on the subject but if you get a treatment whether it chiropractor or a physical therapist and you have to keep going over and over and over then you might want to step back and reevaluate and try something a little different because either you don don the flip side of that if you have a lot of scar tissue and permanent damage that but there are things you can do that will give a person great relief I patients come in that had chronic pain so severe that they wanted to commit suicide it was that bad now I have a lot of videos right now on YouTube on very specific parts of your body and what to do I technique that you can apply to anywhere in the body and then you can watch the specific video to get more data on your specific problem and there nutritional protocol that works very very well so let post-surgery chronic pain and post-injury chronic pain okay let pretend that you have pain on the left ankle right here from a surgery or an injury okay let putting gas in your car and you didn put in brake and you ran over here ankle okay and you have pain now on the left side right here on the outside all right what you want to do is you want to work on the opposite side over here you do not want to work in the area that you have pain if you do you this is definitely something that is not taught in universities or colleges or the schooling that I had I had to figure this out on myself simply because the way that they taught us didn work but it borders on magic as far as its effectiveness okay so you work on the opposite side so wherever it hurts on this side you work on the opposite side the first thing that you want to do if you friend or family member is you get them to rate it on the scale from zero to ten zero being no pain attending the most severe okay you get a number let it have pain in the left ankle you work on the opposite side okay what do I mean work on the opposite side I mean use massage slash acupressure so you you doesn you you opposite side and when I say opposite I the exact opposite point now what interesting about this when you work on the good side it tender when you press if you the exact spot where the injury or the pain is coming from okay now at first when you do this it very tender on the good side so you want to go light and you want to gradually increase pressure but never go too hard you don all you have to do is keep working on this area before let minutes and then you have the person re-rate their pain it down to a four okay but it so then what you do is you ask them okay where moved a little higher or it moved in the top part then you do the exact mirror image on this side so you do the opposite on that side okay and I put some links down below of me actually do you can see but you always work in the opposite side now here that you had a injury in the past and they especially if it part of the body and they they have set up a lot of compensation going in their body to recruit muscles from the opposite side because they limping a little bit okay so the muscles on this side are going to work harder than on this side and so you create this asymmetrical gait and that alone can create a lot of tension and imbalances if you the person has pain on the outside of this joint right here you gonna work on the opposite joint but you that are a little bit higher than this joint okay so you work on the calf muscle or the shin muscle if it ankle if it toe same thing you muscle right here when you work on the opposite muscle you releasing these very very tight cables and a lot of spasm in the calf muscle or the front part of this lower leg as you spasms you it you can use oil or not be very very gentle because these muscles are so tight they tender so step one you work on the opposite us mirror image step two you work on the muscles a little bit higher than the injury on the opposite side okay if the pain is in the knee okay you knee or if it on the inside of the knee or if it the front part of the knee you work on the front part of the opposite knee then you work on the muscles up here okay and you can just massage those muscles so that the same thing with the wrist okay you work on this wrist and these muscles right here if it was this elbow you work on the opposite elbow and the muscles up through here on the front and back and when you do this you to give the person a tremendous amount of relief now realize it might take some time to fully bring it down to zero but you kid changes right off the bat and it quite magical so that would handle the foot ankle the knee the hip you would want to work on the opposite hip okay now the back you would want to work on the front okay the lower abdomen so wherever it hurts on the back you work on the front and just massage in there try to do the mirror image so you can go you go side to side left and right or front to back and that will give the person a lot of relief shoulder just work on the opposite shoulder now there referred pain which you other video but a lot of pain is referred even chronic pain so if there if the right shoulder is a problem it gonna be the gallbladder if that left shoulder it could be the pancreas or the spleen and you to watch the video on that because if you do the opposite shoulder and you have no results suspect there referral problem there the inside the body that pain to another part of the body now a lot of neck pain comes from a digestive issue it can also come from a whiplash injury that put some links down below of what to do for whiplash because that involves several other steps now head pain a lot of this is referred from digestion gallbladder but if you had an injury to a part of your head let right side you work on the opposite side I did a complete video on this as well you can check it out now but a lot of people have had injuries to the head now they have chronic pain in their head and they don gonna be happy that they watch this video abdomen pain really relates to food certain foods of the person eating that you inflammation creating bloating putting the person in a constant inflammatory State you need to get on healthy keto and in a minute fasting for that and that should help especially fasting and so one of the most important things to do for pain and inflammation is fasting it it gives the body a chance to reset and alot of the referral pain that people have pushing the shoulder the neck the head seems to go away but even if they have any of these right here the inflammation will go down because one of the things that happens when you fasting is inflammation just drops way way down so if you have an autoimmune condition you sure the most common type of pain with the diabetic is pain in the feet and the best remedy is something called benfotiamine okay you higher doses of this like four tablets a day or capsules a day and you take spread it out through the day and benfotiamine is a fat soluble vitamin b1 that is great for any type of nerve damage coming from arthritis all right so that as the protocol goes you need to do fasting okay you just need to do it to see for yourself it effective if you click the

What is Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgBJiQbV30k	Dr. Eric Berg DC	So today we chronic fatigue syndrome now if you look at this up you has an unknown cause and the name for that is idiopathic which means a known cause it single case that I poor sleep and sleeping does not improve the situation they exhausted and there pick this up now I personally had this condition in my 20s and I did not know what to do about it I did not look sick from the outside but when I would wake up in the morning I was so tired despite drinking Mass amounts of coffee I could not wake up I was in a constant fog trying to search out something that could help me I street with my wife and I would say honey there in there maybe I can buy another vitamin to try to get my energy back and I had a warehouse filled with supplements and I 100 150 pills a day and nothing worked but before we get into what I did to solve this problem click that red subscribe button and that little bell icon so you can be notified of all the new videos that I in addition to that you notifications of the upcoming live q a that I do several times a week alright so what are the big symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome you guessed it chronic fatigue but there will give us the clue to uncovering what also have memory loss sore throat we enlarged glands and your armpits and your neck right through and here that a little red flag as well joint pain headaches you you sleep but there your energy an extreme exhaustion okay so the enlarged glands and the sore throat give it away one of the biggest causes of chronic fatigue syndrome is a hidden virus okay what you need to know about viruses is this a virus is not really alive it material wrapped in a little Sac that gets activated by your own cells okay and what happens when your immune system overcomes the viruses and deactivates them they can lie dormant for yours and they can also come out of remission and be active that virus the most common virus behind chronic fatigue syndrome is the Epstein-Barr virus okay if you you have Epstein-Barr virus 90 of the population on planet Earth have Epstein-Barr virus it I had it myself really really bad to the point where I could barely even swallow it was so painful this was in high school so what happens is you have this infection it eventually kind of goes in remission you years then you accumulate a lot of stress and maybe you have nutritional deficiencies and then the virus comes out of remission now you may not experience a full-blown infection but just a few of them and one is chronic fatigue or achiness so what makes this virus come out of remission primarily is stress it could be a loss of a loved one or stress at work or whatever and the virus starts coming out of remission if you combine stress with nutritional deficiencies the virus can come out and actually create extreme exhaustion also Epstein virus is one of the causes of Hashimoto hypothyroid condition if you have Hashimoto the video I have on that down below and also take selenium very very important in this situation right here you need high doses of Vitamin D now in the study I have Below on this it it equates high dosages of vitamin D being 20 000 IUS from my viewpoint that is not that high I would recommend 40 000 IUS if this is what you have vitamin D is one of the most potent nutrients to help put a virus back in remission zinc is number two you would want to take 30 milligrams of zinc and also folic acid that as well you can get this from the help of store if you definitely need to learn about something called healthy keto and intermittent fasting because that will help you with this right here and will also help to put this back in remission and let forget about this dress you must do everything you can to improve this stress State Because unless the stress improve it back into remission and the second thing that will cause chronic fatigue syndrome and this is what I had I had this and I had this as well really bad insulin resistance what is insulin resistance well insulin is a hormone that does a lot of things but one of the things that we the cell to allow Fuel and nutrients to go into the cell so if you have a lot of insulin being pumped out in your body over a long period of time that could be toxic so the body is going to resist that and you create this condition called insulin resistance at least 65 to 70 plus percent of the population has this and they don the big things it okay so if you look down you can see your belly chances are you have insulin resistance if you can three or four hours without needing a snack or food you have insulin resistance if you crave sweets you have insulin resistance if you eat a meal and you and you need a little bit of sweet after that you have insulin resistance if you having to urinate chances are you have insulin resistance insulin also lowers blood sugar so insulin is related to blood sugars and consuming too many carbohydrates so if you most of the population that what between insulin resistance and fatigue is that your cells are starving of fuel especially the brain and even the muscles they you energy you focus one really really good simple demonstration you could do with yourself is just consume a protein meal okay just proteins you can have some vegetables no sugar no extra carbohydrates and see how you feel okay if this fatigue goes away then it Condition it correct if you actually do healthy keto and intermittent fasting okay I have about 500 videos on this but don right now just watch the ones that I put down below in the description okay there you have it the two main causes of chronic fatigue syndrome which if you really understand this and you apply what I straightforward to resolve this condition thanks for watching and if you haven click the red button below and that little bell icon so you can be notified of all the new videos that I be releasing and

Sharp Stomach Pain That Comes and Goes	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjmBV2SqY8k	Dr. Eric Berg DC	we have sharp stomach pain that comes and goes there are actually 10 reasons for this specific symptom the first one is something called SIBO and that stands for a small intestinal bacterial overgrowth now take a look at this you have the small intestine right here and you have the large intestine right here sound normally you all the bacteria or most of the bacteria in the large intestine and not the small intestine now you have some bacteria in the small intestine but the majority is in the large intestine where it ferments especially fiber when you have an imbalance we have too many microbes in the small intestine what happens when you eat especially probiotics because you fiber as in vegetables when the fiber goes in here you see microbes start eating the fiber and start to create this fermentation so you get all this gas and the microbes also will compete for the nutrients so you end up becoming deprived of nutrients because they pretty much eating everything that they see normally you all those microbes in here instead you digesting the food from the pancreas and the lining of the small intestine and then breaking down the food and 90% of it is supposed to be absorbed in the small intestine so the worst thing to consume when you have SIBO is vegetables so this is a good time to be a carnivore for a couple months so you can actually clean this thing out and if you do have SIBO and I have videos on it I link down below you need to be taking betaine hydrochloride to acidify the stomach so you can kill off the microbes in the stomach so they don the small intestine number two let you have a part of your intestine just a part of it the the part that very end right here let inflamed okay let which is inflammation of the ileum right down over here and you eat food and it goes through this long little tube right here no pain no pain and then it hits this area of inflammation that raw and you just start hurting okay so if you have inflammation in a certain part your colon that sharp stomach pain and this usually comes from damage with something you eating whether it like gluten for example or other allergies in which case you need to do a food allergy test and avoid those foods so you can start healing this area so I probably should just add gluten and food allergies also if you have an ulcer in part of your colon that can also cause pain and by the way chlorophyll is a great way to heal an ulcer all right number three a gallbladder and the bile duct so you got the liver right here that makes bile it comes down into this common bile duct it it goes into the gallbladder where it concentrated and then when you eat this same contracts and it pushes it out into the small intestine with help of the enzymes from the pancreas together so we have bile plus lipase which is the enzyme from the pancreas to help break down fats but if you type of food or you have high levels of estrogen or cortisol you can develop a stone either in the gallbladder or on the bile duct and that can create a lot of irritation or if you wrong type of foods like junk foods and vegetable oils like corn oil or soy oil which is highly inflammatory that can irritate these ducts right here and cause all sorts of pain and bloating when it becomes distended okay that pressure can cause pain so a problem with the gallbladder and this bile duct is very common I put some links down below for you to get more data on that area number four the pancreas or the pancreatic duct okay so the pancreas makes enzymes the pancreas also makes insulin okay so it actually makes a hormone actually several hormones and enzymes both functions if you many carbohydrates you that pancreas to work really really hard because it has to pump out a tremendous amount of insulin now realize this pancreas has a dual function it hormones and it if you pancreas you other part too so you strain and that can interfere with the normal flow of digestive juices coming through here and it can swell up and cause all sorts of problems with pain congestion especially sharp pain in grains and it reason why a lot of people have sharp pain in their stomach and for some people this could be literally poisonous to their system and really create a lot of damage into the small intestine through here and again the food knowledge is as well okay number six fortification what do I mean by fortification well they enriched flour products with iron and synthetic vitamins iron is a very very toxic to the microbes and to your body especially with men and postmenopausal women who are not menstruating and getting rid of their their blood each month so our bodies don excessive amounts of iron and iron is very very damaging to our brains to our gut and to the liver especially you can create all sorts of issues including cirrhosis so when someone grains in America especially in Canada in the UK it and that just tears up your stomach in other countries that don can somehow get away with consuming grains and not have the bloating and the digestive issues but they still have the weight gain because it turns into carbs pretty fast but the other thing that European countries will do and other countries around the world is that they will make bread products a little bit differently they then they overnight as compared to the bread in the US where they don long it ends up fermenting in your gut so you feel a lot of bloating and anytime you feel bloating you we oils these are like the soy oils canola the corn oil cottonseed oil these are highly inflammatory to the digestive system and the amount of consumption of these oils are off the charts and this is hidden in a lot of foods especially salad dressing mayonnaise and you consuming on a regular basis and not even really realizing that this could be the reason why you have all this pain in your gut and then we have GMO grains so this would be soy and corn and even wheat is sprayed with glyphosate which is the Roundup Ready which can really irritate your digestive system and affect these microbes number 9 low stomach acid this is very very common if you don stomach what food is going to go through here slightly undigested and as the food is not digested up here it ends up down here creating a huge strain and you gonna get abnormal fermentation bloating and pain a simple problem you just need to add outside of vinegar and betaine how to chloride and problems solved and last thing is frequent eating if you doing six meals a day three meals with three snacks not a good idea when you do it with fasting you allow the gut to heal and rest so if you sharp pain and you you really need to do in a minute fasting it do it gives your whole system a chance to reset and heal as far as protein goes you don to do a moderate amount because too much protein can also overload the digestive system especially if you don enough stomach acid and also you want to keep your carbs lower because that can really irritate the liver and the gallbladder and especially the pancreas and normally I recommend a lot of vegetables but not if you have SIBO alright thanks for watching and I you in the next video and if you haven already subscribed click the red button below and that little

10 Benefits of Cryotherapy (Freezing)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUBe0e8c27c	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let cryotherapy or the benefits of freezing so since the Stone Age time our bodies have adapted to various things like starvation and freezing so a little bit of freezing occasionally is very beneficial to your body it creates something called the hormetic effect which is inducing a small stress to make your body stronger and there are certain genes proteins and enzymes to get activated when you put your body in colder temperatures whether you put yourself into a crowd there opee chamber or just take a cold shower you can activate certain genes one is the satellite sound now a satellite cell is like a pre muscle cell like a stem cell that can actually then turn into a muscle cell so one of the benefits is muscle soreness or muscle repair from damage and that gets activated and then you can increase these enzymes called kinases which increase muscle synthesis so again it repairing a muscle damaged after some injury and this is why they apply ice after you have an injury also cold therapy will suppress certain genes that regulate inflammation so it about vaso constricting the blood flow and getting the blood flow out of there it create an effect that epigenetics so so certain things in the environment can turn on or turn off certain genes and col therapy can also increase the number of mitochondria which relates to increasing your metabolism so these are the benefits decreased muscle soreness repair damage improve your immune system but of course if you can add too much stress so I very short amounts of cold therapy number three can decrease inflammation for it can increase your mood try taking a cold shower you exhilaration really fast alright number five it can help you sleep number six it can improve your metabolism number seven it will increase your antioxidant Network - then fight against oxidative stress so it can actually help lower your oxidative stress it can improve herniated discs decrease pain and spasm and I put another video explaining the hormetic effect of various things check it out it interesting	Success
Why Did Mexico Surpass America in Obesity?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDrNV-cPBGM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we Mexico has surpassed the US and obesity rates in Mexico the rate of becoming obese is thirty two point eight percent for adults and in the u.s. it one point eight percent so Mexico is rated number one in obesity not something you want to be rated for seventy percent of adults are overweight childhood obesity spiked up three times within the past ten years and diabetes has doubled since the year 2000 no other country has experienced the rise and obesity of that magnitude so the question is now before I tell you the answer I want to see what you think go ahead and type the answer down below okay I you do that okay I who consumes more soda than any other country in the world and coca-cola controls 73 percent of the Mexican is drink market as compared to the u.s. they only control 42 percent now any time you out whether it this you want to look at what happened what was introduced what was a change right before the spike in a worsening of a symptom or in this case the major spike in obesity and this thing is so obvious before the spike in obesity they were not drinking as much soda and now they are and yes there was a decrease in vegetable consumption by 30% but that does not compare with the massive spike of soda and of course coca-cola wants to retain that control so they sponsoring this programs called exercise is medicine which basically distracts everyone from the sugar that spikes insulin that causes you to get fat and the problem is exercise only gives you 15% of your results 85% of your weight loss results occurs by changing your diet alright guys thanks for watching and comment below on what your thoughts and considerations are about this situation	Success
8 Warning Signs You Should Go See a Doctor	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWnKGxRCNAE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we eight signs and symptoms that you need to go see a doctor now my first disclaimer is I device this is my opinion and check with your doctor before taking my advice of going to the doctor right it doesn make sense now I know you this is obvious this is common sense everyone knows this but you surprised number one if you out go get that checked now it could be that you just exercised or you did fasting where you didn electrolytes in which case you need to take electrolytes or a sea salt but depending on the circumstance if you fainting definitely the regular basis so you passing out get checked out there could be a problem with something called the autonomic nervous system alright number two you have some significant weight loss but no change in diet okay maybe you a sudden you start losing massive amounts of weight get an evaluation and find out what number three chronic constipation when I was in practice I had this patient come to me out of town and she wanted to lose weight she was a very large woman but when we did the consultation I found out that she has serious constipation she goes the bathroom every two weeks and she need to handle your constipation so that would be a putting attention on something not as important anyway I gave her some advice and then when I went to lunch I walked out the building and I walked past her car and he was filled with wrappers from fast-food places in all sorts of all sorts of junk so if you have chronic constipation get an evaluation get your colon scoped out find out what is going on because it can be quite dangerous also chronic diarrhea okay what happens you can lose a lot of electrolytes and that can be very dangerous you can lose zinc and potassium sodium even vitamin D and this can actually greatly affect your heart all right number four excessive urination or thirst now hopefully you and you know that healthy keto and intermittent fasting is the solution for diabetes however if you the time and you chances are you have high blood sugars and you should get it tested and see what have chest pain left arm pain or jaw pain now it could be indigestion and it could be some other thing but it always good to get a test an EKG some deeper evaluation just to rule out a problem with your heart alright number six if you start getting slurred speech facial drooping on one side loss of vision or half of your body becomes paralyzed go get it checked out that sounds like a stroke and by the way as a side note if you can do hyperbaric oxygen therapy right after you had a stroke you can actually minimize the damage big time alright number seven if you have blood in the urine mouth or nose get it checked this could be your coughing up blood from maybe an infection or something else and this could be just a simple situation where you have some allergy and you blew your nose and there talking about more of an excessive situation when you have blood coming out of your body not good alright number eight you have symptoms that are unchanging after you change your diet so you get in healthy keto you a minute fasting and you still have some symptom that when you run into a problem especially if it and sometimes you need more data you need tests to be able to figure this out all right in summary to avoid this these signs and symptoms and that best way to avoid these get on healthy keto and intermittent fasting and I put the links down below	Success
Stop Using Anti-aging Face Creams and Follow this Anti-aging Hacks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njNWerv9mBc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I had a question from someone who made a comment on one of the YouTube videos and they wanted to know about the anti-aging creams if they should use those and do they actually work and the answer is no I they don what they do is make your skin a little bit tighter and they do add more hydration on a temporary basis but not actually younger and in one study which I anti-aging creams will reduce your wrinkles by less than 10 percent over 12 weeks 10 percent is not even noticeable to the human eye so you going to really see too much so what is the solution is there a way to reverse the aging process or at least slow it down and the answer is yes if you understand the simple concept of inside out versus outside and there you body younger by applying something topically or trying to work from the outside in it really comes from the inside out and it but you really want to look at the balance of how much oxidation is going on or things that are breaking your tissues down or destroying your DNA versus the antioxidants in the body which are countering all this free radical damage and just so you know a free radical is an unpaired electron so let right here that spinning around and it only has one electron it doesn electron over here okay it what happens it makes the atom very very unstable and so it can create destruction to the body and an antioxidant will donate an electron to stabilize this to create less damage and there is exogenous that means outside the body from your diet you vegetables you vegetables it is giving you antioxidants and also vitamins act as antioxidants vitamin E vitamin A vitamin C even vitamin b1 can an antioxidant and they always come in networks because when an antioxidant donates its electron it then becomes unstable and it can create some problems so it will borrow an electron from another antioxidant so they come in networks so you have the food that you eat with antioxidants okay that exogenous then you have endogenous antioxidants your body actually can make and the oxidants so that combination of both need to be in such quantity to counter the amount of oxidation coming in from the environment and from your diet that things break down and making you age prematurely so what can make this worse the big thing is glucose high carb diets that will trigger insulin which will then combine with certain proteins in your body and cause this other phenomena called glycation so when you combine sugar with a protein it creates a protein that that less elastic and that you look a lot older and another term for that is advanced glycation end products and that is created by glucose having a high amount of glucose in the diet the other thing that is nutritional deficiencies can fail to supply certain biochemical enzymes that are supposed to repair and keep your tissue stable at the cellular level so nutrition is a really key part in slowing the aging process down faster than it scenario is this combination between a high carb diet and low nutrients that going to age your skin it you look older it inside of the body and on the flip side of that if you switch your fuel from glucose to ketones ketones act as an antioxidant which is really really cool so it I always recommend the healthy version of the ketogenic diet so that way we can actually add the nutrients from the food to prevent the free radical damage and keep your skin and your tissues looking healthy so there involved they hormone that you really want to preserve is growth hormone growth hormone is all about anti-aging it intact and I the hair the nails the inside of the body growth hormone is responsible for that as we age growth hormone goes down we want to keep it as high as possible so there are certain things that lower growth hormone and there things that will increase it glucose by the way will lower our growth hormone insulin will lower growth hormone so high carbohydrate diets stay away from them cortisol from stress will also inhibit growth hormone cortisol is very destructive on your proteins on your skin and it will aid you in an accelerated rate alcohol is another thing that is very dehydrating it will inhibit growth hormone it will make you look old alright so how do we raise growth hormone well exercise okay but make sure you don exercise correctly with them enough recovery you can spike growth from about five to seven hundred percent so that one key factor regular exercise plus the exercise can if done correctly reduced the cortisol to stress and then fast and fasting is probably one of the most important things if you wanted to slow down the aging process and look younger also when you do periodic prolonged fasting you stimulate stem cells stem cells actually help you regrow new tissue like your immune system your gut your skin so fasting is probably one of the biggest things that can help you look younger it can stimulate growth hormone by thirteen hundred to two thousand percent and then we have sleep sleep is another key factor to enhancing growth hormones so if you do intermittent fasting and prolong fasting you get enough sleep you keep your stress down you exercise you do healthy keto that is your best bet to slow down the aging process but to actually think that you can actually do it with a cream it work alright guys thanks for watching and check out a couple of these very interesting videos I have related to growth hormone	Success
How To Test Yourself For Adrenal Fatigue Â Dr. Berg On Adrenal Insufficiency	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjMhPVi1jzs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey it video on how to test yourself for adrenal fatigue again this is not the definitive diagnosis for adrenal diseases I you can get some clues on maybe some potential weaknesses within your adrenals but you go to your doctor to confirm it okay so that said there are several symptoms that go along with the adrenal function you can easily maybe you o between nine and ten and you miss that cutoff you start waking up and now you really have can or 12 and you takes 90 minutes because you missed the wave and then you might get up at 2 o exhausted those are symptoms of the adrenal you especially an hour after lunch you exhausted you need a nap yet at 2 o awake achy you can call that whatever you want you can call it plantar fasciitis that feet you can call it fibromyalgia all that means is you anti inflammatory hormones and your whole body is a key brain fog hard to focus non-sequitur go in a room can remember why you went in there you know it book it doesn tolerance people are starting to get on your nerves right you into a room and you see something out of order and your attention focuses in on only that and not the rest of the room breathing issues and that has to do with two things number one going up the stairs flight of stairs and your your legs are getting heavier okay or at night you can that pH is actually too alkaline not too acidic and that you problems okay sinus the sinus does get congested with adrenal so that get allergies as well decreased libido is adrenal and lastly Disney dizzy when you stand up so let down like that on a table and then you late for about three or four minutes and you take your blood pressure okay and then you stand up and take the blood pressure okay that is the test to measure adrenal function it is called the Raglan check your blood pressure lying down for you no wait just relax for a few minutes and then stand up and check your blood pressure now normal blood pressure is 120 over 80 so let and when you stand up this blood pressure the top number that systolic that should go up by 6 to 10 points normally with adrenal fatigue it will go down or it goes excessively to high so it determine your ability to adapt to gravity stress so now that the test but here to the purpose of the adrenal and your adrenal gland your adrenal gland is a survival gland it actually helps you cope with stress it helps you adapt your body to stress standing up is a little bit of gravity stress and your body will then adapt and raise the blood pressure to adapt for that position change because if you did not adapt to that gravity stress there won blood flow in your brain and you will pass out thus the symptom of dizzy when you stand up too fast ok does it you get that so that adapting another way you could run up the stairs and if you get out of breath too fast from a little run up the stairs we know that heavy legs some people will get up too fast and they can even pass out that an adrenal weakness because it because what happens the adrenal gland has an outside this is all gland tissue and they both on the kidneys and it has an inside the Drina gland is the only gland that has two parts and inside and outside the outside is all gland tissue produces hormones but the inside is all nerve tissue I don it a kind of a double thing and the nerve tissue inside the adrenal produces hormone like messages and they neuro transmitters adrenaline noradrenaline serotonin dopamine gaba those are all neurotransmitters and adrenaline is a stress hormone so adrenaline is there to help neurologically activate certain things like if you being chased by a tiger the artery has to open up to the heart the lung has to open up I mean think about they EpiPen epinephrine to help them breathe if they have an allergy they inject the heart with adrenaline to open up the blood flow so in other words this tissue on the inside is part of the adrenal system of the stress response it gets your body to adapt to stress and if you wanted to know the name of that nervous system I it system another name for the sympathetic nervous system is the flight or fight mode so you tossed around but I want to explain what that means a little bit more if if you see a lion in the wilderness chase zebra the lion is attacking he zebra the zebra is flighting is running away they just depends on what end of the spectrum the lion is looking for supper and the zebra is looking to avoid being supper and so it one is a starting situation if I don eat that animal I going to die it if I get eaten I won what flatter fight means and so we all have the system inside body but we Tigers what we the news the media other people threaten financial disasters threatened stresses losses physical trauma so you have a lot of other stresses worried that type of thing that type of stress is equivalent to physical trauma okay so basically in a thumbnail sketch if you that your adrenals are fatigued you can simply just check one test you can just basically check the blood pressure lying and standing and seeing if this blood pressure goes up six to ten points if it doesn weakness within that system there lot of videos I have on what you do about adrenal fatigue but I wanted to explain just a way to test it okay now in this next part I want to show you one more part or one more thing that happens with adrenal and a very simple thing you can do to help with adrenal fatigue so one of the problems with an a burnt-out adrenal is that you start excessively thinking and analyzing everything let me demonstrate oh my god how many calories is this oh gosh my wife is really irritating me John at work he is just really something else my videographer is taking way too long when you thinking I know it but really you have to realize what happening you space the best thing the easiest thing that you can do when you is create space what do you do to get outside go for a walk go for a hike get out there and just get your attention on something else and do it for an hour do it for longer it to add more space because what that will do that will chill out the adrenals allow you to heal better versus going into the gym behind the treadmill and trying to watch that TV screen right there yeah you worked out but you didn get any more space so you really have to balance out the the entire day of activities for something that will just get your attention going way out there all right hope that helps see you the next video	Success
Calcium Benefits: Way Beyond The Bones Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK4Qd3AtzEY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey it we relationship to other functions most people Associated calcium with just bone building but calcium has some very important other functions that you need to know about the number one function is it communication the signaling of communication between cells it mineral that helps the cell communicate um there is a condition that occurs when you will start to increase the calcium inside your cells okay so normally outside the cell you have 10,000 times more calcium than inside the cell so we got this perfect Network balance of calcium regulation in and outside the cell okay so just a little bit of disruption of that balance can create a lot of side effects but this condition where you have low calcium yet high calcium inside the cell which is um very common is called intracellular hyper calcinosis now don name all it means is there cell inside that too much calcium inside that cell okay and that there we let that happens you get hypertension you get Harding of the arteries why because all that calcium cannot be mobilized now it people take when they have high blood pressure one form of um hypertension medication is called calcium channel blockers what do you think that does it blocks calcium from going inside the cell okay and it actually helps lower blood pressure but we got to look at the whole picture here because this condition can also lead to diabetes because of the relationship ship between how calcium affects the receptors for insulin okay so it can create diabetes uh cancer now how can that occur well one thing that calcium does is it controls um the reproduction of cellular growth in other words there called apoptosis which basically means normal cell death in your body if you have too much cells that are growing out of control that so you have a mechanism in your body that controls um the growth of cells and actually causing cells to die in a good way just to keep them regulated well calcium is involved in that so if there get a situation where it control and the cells are growing growing growing and the cells can get bigger prostate cancer um tumors um and just regular cancer um and I I to share some links down below if you want to get the Tactical uh version of this but inflammation is another symptom in soft tissue calcium that that the AR uh I arthritis btis tendonitis kidney stones gall stones plaing on the arteries in the brain that these things can occur if there much calcium inside the cell okay so now that that well calcium doesn unless it has uh Transport Systems so you have certain vitamins and certain things that help mobilize calcium number one vitamin D if the person is low in vitamin D that can create the situation because they calcium here and then the body to compensate by holding more calcium inside the cell low vitamin D levels right interesting but I always want to know what causes low vitamin D levels because there not getting Sun Number One stress high levels of cortisol that hormone can keep your vitamin D levels low which can create this whole Chain Reaction so when people say these conditions can be caused by stress they can but here occur um another thing is low bile b e that liver that helps you absorb uh certain fats and fat C of vitamins vitamin D is a fat C of vitamin so if you have a gallbladder issue um or liver issue or let get a lot of uh saturated fats that help release it um you could be deficient in BIO and get right should shoulder pain bloating digestive problems constipation well that is that means that you don have enough bile so it hard to absorb vitamin D and it to hard hard to regulate the calcium see that whole Chain Reaction there another vitamin called vitamin K2 I created a couple videos on this but vitamin K2 is very very important to go with go with Vitamin K Vitamin D3 because vitamin K2 not K1 regulates calcium it gets rid of soft tissue calcium it takes the calcium from the cells and it drives it into the bone it helps make the arteries elastic it really good for osteoporosis it good for all these conditions um so vitamin K2 how can you become deficient well if you have a low fat diet because guess where you get this in all the grass-fed fats animal products it some vegetarians called NATO and things if you you want to get that but the point is that lowfat diets and low um foods low in grass-fed things like grass-fed uh butter grass-fed beef if you eating typical grain-fed animal products you very very common thing that people have they get this situation right here now poor diet uh low Omega vitamin uh omega3 fatty acids now that interesting because back in the 1920s vitamin I mean omega-3 was called um vitamin F vitamin f is another name for these un saturated uh fats which basically is omega-3 if you vitamin O3 omega-3 you can have a problem with calcium Transportation as well uh and then low magnesium you get magnesium from vegetables if you eating vegetables you might be low magnesium boom we get this excess calcium so I mean a lot of people take calci magnesium for these conditions right here but now you understand why it works um this is why it works now if you calcium calcium carbonate that Limestone um well guess what that can create the situation too because it not going to be absorbed and it can clog up all your cells okay so you have to be able to understand that that is not the best source of calcium just read the label make sure it carbonate the other thing is that if your digestive system is bad you can absorb minerals that could be another reason but if you look at why people take vitamin D vitamin K2 omega-3 and magnesium they take those to help um decrease inflammation they take it to improve the immune system they take it for all these conditions but what what they doing is they of calcium okay so I just want to give you some insights on the importance of calcium and the danger of uh too much calcium inside the cell and it has a lot more to do with not just the bone but intercellular communication okay	Success
Hypertension, Vitamin K2, and Vitamin D3 Testimonial - Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpPEIXotGMs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey Dr Burke here in this short little video we want to talk about a great success so um we blood pressure now before we get started I want to just let you know we making any claims to cure blood pressure any medical diseases what I do is I like to work with the person as a kind of a team to work on the nutrition part to help them increase health so then they can reduce the medication so now um you were on some medications uh tell us a little bit about medications you blood pressure was pretty high right yes I was uh taking Lipitor beta blocker and norx and I forget the other on it was a concoction of few different medications basically very high blood pressure 160 by 110 and uh since I and seeing uh but now for for a while I you introduced me to D3 and K2 uh and uh when I started to do that along with the kale juice and all that uh my blood pressure kept on going down and my physician uh kept on reducing the dosage uh of the medication that I was taking and actually I medication and I actually have low blood pressure at some times uh just came off of the month of uh fasting in which it was little difficult to take the d and the D3 and K2 uh maybe transposing the numbers but in any event I track uh and I every day and my blood pressure is completely normal uh I would say about 120 by 75 which is remarkable even with the medication I was taking I was 135 130 by 80 85 but now without medication I am even lower wow that that the medication obviously was not working your wife is a radiologist and I she was happy that you reducing your medications but I want to explain what K2 is and D3 um vitamin D3 and K2 um don pressure what they do is they help mobilize calcium in the arteries and brings me to yeah I get to that and so the calcium that plugs up the pipes sort to speak the vessels and it makes it more like hardened arteries the blood pressure go up because they um K2 and D3 um and I like to do like four of each per day I I like the D3 to be 10,000 IUS and the K2 to be at 100 micrograms and take four of each in the morning and then what happens is that um it starts to mobilize calcium out of the vessels not just the heart valves and the blood vessels but the arteries through the the corate to the neck up into the brain because you had a problem when you tilt your neck back remember you actually had pain yeah uh I could not do this and I could not lie down and look up and the whole uh you know I I used to the the the ceiling would be uh turning and I don that problem and the only thing I doing different is really taking these three and you had predicted that that that putting me on those things and also inside of my teeth uh I just had my uh hygienist she felt that I had a lot more of calcium or deposits on my inside of the DN and now I certainly uh a surplus of calcium buildup which your my body apparently was releasing and it was sticking to my teeth what what happens is that um K2 helps mobilize calcium out of the wrong place and and it helps get it out of the system if there sometimes it can come out through the pores of your body I coming of the deer Ducks but most of the time it just goes into the bone so um yeah so anything like soft tissue calcium uh arthritis btis tontis blood pressure um calcium buildup in the joints where you clear up with these two n nutrients so it think within the next three four years you doing this combination because it handles so many issues with people I mean as people get older they turn into a stone they become very very stiff and they get heart problems women that take calcium without the K2 and the D3 end up with a lot of problems with the heart so um even the medication for blood pressure one of the medications is calcium channel blockers what that is a medication that get the calcium out of the heart right now they for the heart which is a calcium Scan they look for plaing calcium which is much better than so cholesterol is a whole different thing over here but calcium is a a more important indicator right now for overall health so I just wanted to say this is awesome and thank you for sticking to it and your success and I wish you the best in the future thank you very much you welcome	Success
Sleepy After Lunch? Your SIESTA Means You Have...	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzOA4uQ6-5w	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so let siesta where you want to take a nap and why that is due to carbohydrates more than any other reason now there are many countries that take a siesta and by the way siesta comes from the Spanish word meaning nap and the Latin word for sixth hour and that refers to the countdown from dawn meaning midday so there are many countries known for these siestas Mexico certain countries in South America Italy Philippines Vietnam certain Mediterranean countries southern Europe and Spain and of course in America we don say that we have a siesta but we basically fall asleep in front of our computer right after lunch so the question is is it normal for someone to get tired after eating now there post prandial which means after a meal zomlings and that means food comma and of course this is a common feature for diabetes so when you have the combination of especially refined carbohydrates and volume of calories together it can really create a blood sugar spike and an insulin spike both of these are going to make you tired now the question is why would they make you tired there go beyond the insulin resistance mechanism where you fuel go into the cell alright number one you activate something called the parasympathetic nervous system so there nervous system you know the sympathetic which is flight-or-fight and the parasympathetic which is rest and digest so when you eat a lot of food especially we to activate this system over here and inhibit this system and you want to take a nap so that would be the gut brain connection and with that you brain and more blood into the digestive system so try to be awake when you don have the amount of blood to the brain it three decreases the arousal pathways in the hypothalamus in the brain making you tired and number four and this is interesting when you consume a high carb diet you gonna absorb certain amino acids but not others specifically you valine leucine isoleucine but not tryptophan so tryptophan is going to be absorbed through the blood-brain barrier and it serotonin and melatonin the sleep hormone so if you live in any one of these countries or in the US I want you to try an experiment like in Mexico you would have tortillas and corn based type things rice Italy you pasta Philippines in Vietnam you gonna have rice noodles the Mediterranean you pasta and bread southern Europe well you might have potatoes or some other starch and in Spain you carbs so here consuming carbohydrates at your lunch for one week and you your energy is going to go straight up the need for a nap is not going to be there and for those of you that are new to my channel check out this video on low carbs it will tell you exactly what to eat	Success
What is Menopause... Really	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dNttlPqRzU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today I want to talk about what is menopause really well it situation where you eggs a woman has about 400 eggs and every month the egg gets released right around age 51 maybe a little bit earlier a little bit later you ran out of that last egg you menstruation no more pregnancy it right well then comes the hot flashes the vaginal dryness the vaginal atrophy mood changes weight gain loss of libido bone loss and atrophy so just when you thought things are gonna be great you got all these things to deal with so what actually is happening is you getting a shift in hormones and there three hormones that are involved you have estrogen testosterone and progesterone and these are not accurate but I typically before menopause versus after you about 50 maybe 40 to 50 percent testosterone is gonna drop about 50 percent but check this out progesterone is gonna drop between 70 and 90 percent so progesterone is the one that really crashes and burns progesterone counters and buffers estrogen they work together so forgetting this massive drop in progesterone versus estrogen we have this ratio that going to make estrogen appear dominant in the body and this is why you have some of the symptoms right here because it when in reality it is lower but this is the one that actually makes it appear to be high in the body and creates a lot of problems now the other thing you have to realize is that you have a backup mechanism okay a plan B and that adrenals the adrenals actually make these three hormones too and they supposed to act as a backup to the ovaries and give you the right amount of these hormones of course you don the same amount of hormones as before menopause because you baby but here weak going into menopause and they not able to back up the ovaries appropriately you seeing problems with these hormones because you you can start experiencing these symptoms right here happens all the time in fact 70 percent of women after menopause develop hot flashes so in reality all these symptoms are not normal but if the adrenals are weak that problems so what you really need to do is support the adrenals before menopause and try to keep your stress as low as possible that more than anything estrogen not only comes from the ovary and from the adrenals it comes from your own fat so depending on how much weight you certain levels of estrogen so this could literally just go down slightly maybe down maybe I know 30% maybe even 20% making this difference here this ratio even worse so the real situation is this the adrenals are just not backing up these ovaries right here so number one support the adrenals before menopause but some of you watching are actually after menopause so what do you do in that situation well you do not go on a low-fat diet do not lower your dietary cholesterol why because all of these hormones are made out of cholesterol that you actually go on a low-fat diet low cholesterol diet you are going to negatively influence these hormones alright number three counter high cortisol because the adrenals are acting to support the ovaries you a spike in cortisol okay that cortisol it several ways one is it destroys your bone that sometimes develop osteopenia and even osteoporosis and they get atrophy it looks like cellulite but it loss of muscle which you atrophy or loose muscle tissue and look like it basically a loss of muscle tissue and it thanks to cortisol cortisol also affects the sleep cycle and it also releases stored sugar so it raises insulin it turns your own body proteins especially the thigh and the leg muscles and your butt muscles into glucose which then triggers insulin this is why after menopause it the darn cortisol that insulin so I put some links down below on all sorts of things you can do to support the adrenals but you definitely need to get on healthy keto and in a minute fasting to keep the insulin in check that you lose weight and also helping you correct a very slow metabolism number form it would make sense to do something to beef up no pun intended your progesterone wild yam cream is a really good remedy there yam cream for that and that way this will push this up and help you reduce some of these right here now because your estrogen is a little bit higher and that could be damaging because it being opposed by the progesterone effectively I would recommend consuming more cruciferous vegetables just to keep that estrogen in check cruciferous vegetables seek help in something called dim which is basically concentrated cruciferous all can help to balance these three estrogens and give you more of a good estrogen and less of the bad so it like breast cancer things like that and lastly vitamin E a lot of the vitamin E is stored in the pituitary gland that actually controls the adrenal and controls the ovary and so vitamin E drops significantly after menopause so if you actually take enough vitamin E in the correct type which I you in a second you can support the adrenals and the ovaries and minimize a lot of these symptoms right here the type of vitamin E that I would recommend is not a synthetic version I would get the natural to call mix with something called tocotrienols okay tocotrienols you can look it up and get them in a whole food blend and that can really support your pituitary and really help you reduce these symptoms right here all right check out the other videos I have on the screen to give you even more things you can do for menopause thanks for watching	Success
Will Adrenal Fatigue Cause Weight Gain? Cushing's Syndrome & High Cortisol Levels Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czu9yMSj6oM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let answer the question will adrenal fatigue actually cause you to gain weight or not but you also have to understand why you would get weight gain with adrenal fatigue and how it all works so the first thing you need to know is that the medical profession does not acknowledge adrenal fatigue as a medical problem okay they don know why not because there is a condition of hyper cortisol ism okay that gland has an outside and an inside the outside makes cortisol this is the stress hormone so there called Cushing book I collection of medical illustration volume for endocrinology by Frank knitter so as you can see right here there syndrome this is high cortisol hyper cortisol ism okay too much cortisol but here wake up with this condition no it starts at a certain point and it gradually gets worse and worse and worse and worse just like you have instant resistance pre-diabetic and then eventually a diabetic so the cortisol being high there could be subclinical where you start developing symptoms yet it full-blown problem yet and that way I look at adrenal fatigue because you can have a series of stress events over the years and start having more and more problems with fatigue to the point where it becomes magnified as a full-blown Cushing here are the symptoms with a full-blown Cushing syndrome case okay a lot of visceral fat so you but not necessarily kind of like a superficial love handles as much or superficial fat all over its gonna be in the midsection mainly and I think the reason why is because cortisol is a stress hormone and if you think about during dates your body would want to store fat closest to the organs the vital organs the liver the heart things like that number two high blood pressure the three round face red cheeks fatigue lowered immune system susceptible to viruses anxiety Buffalo Hump okay fat on your collarbone also you have thin skin because cortisol is a very destructive hormone it catabolic so it starts to break down proteins and you your skin the skin is just very very thin decreased libido then we have low potassium and you also have high sodium so you vitamin D levels okay now there of other symptoms involved but these are the main ones also insomnia that another one as well other than that you can be perfectly fine and a lot of people have a lot of these symptoms so they may not have a full-blown Cushing syndrome but they might have something that adrenal fatigue so if we come back to the question can adrenal fatigue cause weight gain it really depends on how chronic it is okay now high cortisol can come from many things stress it could come from a tumor and your pituitary it could come from a virus it could come from major loss of a loved one so it can come from many different things but if you have chronic stress that can definitely create adrenal fatigue so it really depends how long you stress or if it was a short-term thing and your diet there having high cortisol causing the fat but then what about the diet are you eating really good to maybe counter some of that effect because the more stressor you are the healthier the diet should be but in theory people will tend to eat what when they carbs right so that makes things worse and then also what is causing this stress what is triggering this thing you locate the actual cause of the stress and fix it and sometimes you can slowly over time but there something you can do to improve this situation so really the weight gain depends on several factors so here another question that I think it really important is why with someone with adrenal fatigue or high cortisol actually gain weight in the first place well the cortisol is a survival hormone and it needs to release quick energy okay so what it does is it releases stored sugar from your liver and your muscles so it just dumps this sugar okay so that then this sugar then gets converted into fat later okay especially if you don because we tiger anymore we we all the sugar can easily then be converted to fat around your gut so cortisol gives you quick energy releases sugar but it also does this other thing it will make new sugar it neo Genesis now where does it make sure you converts your muscles into sugar which then turns into fat okay and what muscle does it primarily go after your thigh muscle and your gluttonous Maximus so you start losing your thighs and your butt so all this turns into sugar then converts into fat around the midsection so that in the midsection but now how does this actually work well high sugar stimulates insulin okay and insulin will do two things insulin is a fat making hormone but it also prevents the burning of fat so if here you are in this chronic stress states okay we eating sugar just being in stress and your body is not going to be able to get you in the ketosis because of highest cortisol and the high sugar in the high insulin so it hard for you to get in the state of fat-burning if you have high cortisol and we diet at all and they also mentioned that the cortisol receptors a lot of them are in the midsection right here so that where you the kind of a protective mechanism to feed organs during stress dates and because the vitamin D is low your cortisol can be even higher because vitamin D helps to regulate cortisol it helps to keep cortisol in check this and this is why a low vitamin D state can also gain weight because the chorus all goes up also your potassium is going to be lowered okay right here and you not going to be able to regulate that insulin resistance when you take insulin you make insulin more sensitive and it can actually help to prevent it from getting out of control so when you have high cortisol there potassium low vitamin D high sodium situation alright so now that you have all the different pieces to this puzzle which i think is very important starting out with increasing your awareness of what is the stress that whole thing you have to look into your life and find out what stress that is even if there is a tumor somewhere what could trigger the tumor alright so now that you question is identifying the trigger what is causing this high level of cortisol it related to stress and you have to kind of scan your environment find out where it and do what you can to improve it as much as possible very important okay next one is keto healthy keto this is going to lower your stress because ketones are a more efficient fuel they they very stressful and it creates the blood sugar swings and it can really wear you out then intamin fasting it increases your cells tolerance to so it actually makes your cells tough so these these two right here are very very important taking vitamin D can actually help lower cortisol so that important I would take at least 20,000 I use okay with that take vitamin k2 vitamin C is needed a lot of the vitamin C in your body is stored in your green or glands so you need about M and C to support the adrenal and this can also come from sauerkraut is a good source of vitamin C and leafy greens and then potassium from leafy leafy greens as well as avocados because potassium can help make insulin work better and help minimize the insulin spike and also almost forgot about it would be one very very very important all right so coming full circle will adrenal fatigue cause weight gain it really depends on your diet how long the stress is been there alright have you fixed the stress and use other factors like nutrients and fasting and check out this video on the adrenal body type if you haven definitely check it out	Success
What Causes Cataracts? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH5ZEufCG3k	Dr. Eric Berg DC	all right in this next question a person asks Dr Berg what causes cataracts all right so I want to discuss cataracts and it has to do with a person acid alkaline levels and I talk about this in my book on page 50 under the adrenal gland chapter because when the adrenal gland overacts and produces too much cortisol that what happen s is it it causes the release of a lot of acid from the urine so when you check the urine the person pH is very very very acid it acid so you may look at that and go wow the person is too acid we need to alkalize them that would be a big mistake because when you lose your acids your pH then starts becoming more alkaline so seven is neutral when you go above seven becoming more alkaline and when you seven below seven it if you is going to rise upward and because the blood operates at a very narrow band between 7.34 and 7.45 so it it it a very small range and if the pH of that blood blood goes too high you to develop something called alkalosis now what is alkalosis that just means that your blood is a condition that happens with adrenal gland problems and stress so but when you measure the urine it acid that your acids and your body is becoming too on the opposite and the blood is becoming too alkaline when the blood is overly alkaline you you a big problem with calcium calcium will not not necessarily go this doesn work um go in the body anymore it goes on the tissues okay so it develops on the nerves as ntis like all the itis is inflammation on the heels as heel spurs on the joints is arthritis on the Bersa is berstis that on the tendons is tendonitis on the eyes is cataracts that because the body is to alkaline I talking about the blood I mean there have to alkalize or die and that actually a myth because you going to create a worsening of the problems calcium Dev develops on the arteries as plaing on the kidneys as kidney stones and the gall Bladers gall stones on the nerve on the left actually it could be on the right or left as a little twitching on the eyelid that because the pH is too alkaline and the calcium is not going in the bone of the muscle that calves or tight shoulders up here so all from the adrenal gland overacting you can have all those conditions can you imagine treating each one of those separately we have to get to the root problem the cause and so doing that you would want to acidify the body now how do you do that well people that are excessively alkaline tend to Crave acids like they might like the um what um apple cider know the cider vinegar chips the vinegar chips they might like carbonated water or Sodas because it is carbonic acid so they want what they should do is do peligrino or perer because the carbonated water will acidify them as well but the best thing to do is to take a little lemon in your water or maybe some apple cider vinegar in your water or even cranberry all those are very acidic and of course I recommend that in my book on the drenal chapter you unsweetened cranberry upet of vinegar and a little lemon and some water to start to acidify you and sometimes people say well Dr B why are we trying to acidify because most people are actually too alkaline in the blood but they they the calcium doesn breathing becomes off so you you can like you don down at night because you don calcium to wind you down so there lot of other problems that occur but that so this is some extra background data I hope that help I video	Success

The #1 Most Powerful Epigenetic Trigger: SURPRISING	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzJtZt4_Y5Y	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we powerful trigger of epigenetics now what is epigenetics so epigenetics is those factors that are outside of your genes that affect your genes that turn them on or turn them off it or silenced so epigenetics are the controlling factor for what diseases you to live what health so it predestined gene that you to live with because your genes are a certain way there to this and that there are certain things that influence epigenetics your environment medication drugs your diet your age so as you get older you have more more DNA damage but realize all these work together so you also have do you die if you die it really good that can actually help slow this down if you drugs and chemicals that can speed things up then you have the stress level of the person that can affect your outcome and then we have nutritional efficiencies which is a huge factor that has the ability to mimic radiation as far as damage to your DNA and exercise is also an epigenetic factor but there actually something even bigger and more powerful that can create a more dramatic effect I don the term spontaneous remission where someone has a disease and all of a sudden it just goes away or they positive and then all of a sudden they and it shrank and just completely disappeared and there book mind over medicine by Lisa Rankin MD who talked about this I the link down below and actually on this page at the end but it book about spontaneous remission and also the placebo effect and why that works in certain people and maybe not other people quite fascinating and there which is a database of over 3,500 references 300 journals 20 different languages documenting case after case of unexplained spontaneous disease remission where someone had a disease they had no treatment and then it just disappeared fascinating so we need to add another one on this list so I gonna have to put an 8 right here and this would be your thoughts your beliefs how much confidence you have on something or your viewpoint or your agreement on something and this is why a lot of times if someone has cancer they go the doctor this is you have exactly four months to live and they die exactly a four month so your mental state and your thoughts are by far superior to all of these right here and this also explains why when someone their outcome is not good in fact it almost impossible to heal if you stress state and of course because thoughts are invisible you can it people tend to downplay it especially within the medical profession but you should check out this link that I put down below and also check out this book quite fascinating so anyway I wanted to expand your viewpoint on epigenetics and check out this video on this page you	Success
4 Ways to Neutralize Uric Acid	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVnEp5wYztw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today I want to talk about neutralizing uric acid and some of the conflicting information that revolves around that topic uric acid is formed when it trying to break down purine which is another compound found in foods mainly in like organ meats and meats but it in certain vegetables as well uric acid can also act as an antioxidant in your body and that it might elevate when you fasting as a way to enhance your immune system now when the pH of your urine becomes too acidic this uric acid can leak out into the joints and cause gout it can leak into the kidneys and cause uric acid kidney stones so what is the solution one thing you could do is you could alkalize your body okay you can do that with the tasin citrate which is alkaline you can do that with by consuming more alkaline vegetables you can also consume baking soda you can also consume some other alkaline minerals like magnesium and calcium as soon as this pH starts going up a little bit you gout for example will go away now this is where the confusion comes in because apple cider vinegar seems to be very good to help neutralize uric acid but this is an acid so it confusing but this is just an exception to the rule ALP Center vinegar will help neutralize uric acid now vitamin C from lemons or lemon juice will also help reduce your acid also reducing glucose and fructose will definitely decrease uric acid and this is why a diabetic has a higher risk of having gout because their blood sugars are just too high now also organ meats if you have gout you might want to decrease the amount of organ meats and sardines and just go a little lower on the protein that you consume now the vegetables that will aggravate uric acid are asparagus spinach and green peas as well as cauliflower and check out some of these other videos on your cast if you just want more data thanks for watching	Success

Burke it here again we did a podcast for you summit and then I had the pleasure of speaking at your summit about PCOS and because that about although I do see people with all kinds of different expressions of metabolic syndrome but my little passion my big passion is eCos so I would love to talk to you about that thing and so I wanted to thank you once again for inviting me to speak with you today and being at your summit and I got to meet your lovely wife and being in your home so thank you thank you again so what is eCos first and foremost it important polycystic ovary syndrome but dr. Burke you probably a great majority of your listeners know what PCOS is or at least have heard of it so every time I do a talk including at your summit which was a huge audience by the way I asked all of those people how many of you people have heard of PCOS and almost I would say at least 80% and remember that a lot of the talks that we do do a lot of our audiences are our medical professionals up that summit so it professionals know of PCOS unfortunately it reproductive endocrine and surn hormonal concern of women in the reproductive years the most common okay if statistics say between 80 to maybe 30% of all young women so pre menopausal women have PCOS polycystic ovary syndrome it might be more it might be less I don totally honest diagnostic criteria is the best way to diagnose PCOS but this is how it diagnosed so basically let that what are the three diagnostic criteria so two out of the three and you polycystic ovary syndrome is a syndrome it meaning you have to rule out other underlying at other possible conditions right so there conditions that can mimic PCOS but they because it what they rule out other conditions and when it not any of those then if you have two out of these three expressions so one is clinical expressions not necessarily lab not not necessarily lab with clinical expressions of high male hormones so with all those androgens or hyper and drogyny a-- so high levels of male hormones and a woman and a lot of us know what this looks like severe acne hirsutism which is facial and body hair grows and then male pattern baldness and women right we and many there you could get very evening as a voice you can get an enlarged enlarged clitoris I mean this is it gets worse and worse more of these free male hormones you have going through your body right clinical expression of high male hormones because the lab expressions are not best because fluctuate throughout the day so it very hard to pinpoint but the clinical expressions are very obvious nicely from experience when I was in my 20s the second thing is abnormal or irregular period and/or ovulation right which is a big concern we about that and then the third is the presence of these cysts that called polycystic ovary syndrome the presence of multiple cysts on the ovaries on ultrasound so when the doctor does an ultrasound the technician does an ultrasound if you have two out of these three and you ruled out other conditions there list of conditions then you with PCOS please note that no we did we talk about obesity so weight is not a diagnostic criteria or some other related conditions okay so that PCOS is very common as I said maybe eight to thirty percent of all women maybe even more that debilitating okay so what do I mean by this imagine being 20 years old and a cute young girl or young lady and having facial hair and acting right not not to say all these other things but there lot of that in itself can be devastating I went I could say 15 there younger women with PCOS you can get diagnosed with PCOS after puberty although although it diagnose PCOS in puberty because or around puberty and adolescence because a lot of these expressions or symptoms aren it getting treated early enough probably right right it debilitating it is it very serious because it associated with many serious concerns and this is what I hope to talk a little bit with you today so as dr. Fung would say and does say in that book that you have there if PCOS was just about a little acne and a few missed periods and that wouldn be so bad I think it even if thou were it but it maybe we can talk a little bit about that yes so there consequences of having this condition I would spike gas you tell me if I correct or not but pregnancy if you pregnant you and you it longer fertile and then you you have this condition and then now you artificially or whatever I mean what what are the consequences well maybe you should probably talk about what body that thank you people a foundation yeah so this is a great thing so that art book is about PCOS plan it doom and gloom and we tell you okay this is the worst thing ever and thirty percent of women have it we possibly preventable and reversible condition that that this and why doctor fun who doctor like you said why is he writing about PCOS the reason why he about PCOS is because he obesity code he code he fasting and now we know about PCOS and we know it condition we know just like diabetes just like obese it causes PCOS it PCOS I was very in I weighed 97 pounds when I was diagnosed PCOS I was always very good I when I talk about this I find that this is very important it is true that a lot of women with PCOS have obesity a lot of women with piece as well so it added thing and they have central obesity in most cases I did right away start to get the central Issa to even at a very thin so meaning I had a higher percentage of body fat even though I was thin and I had fat around my organs okay like why I expressed so many of these things so quickly and so young I develop diabetes right away I develop retention right away so it these conditions because it has the same underlying problem which is high insulin I for insulin emia which leads to insulin resistance and again as dr. Fung would say I he would say if the problem is high insulin and the solution is to lower insulin and we know how to do that and I remember saying this at your summit where I said to when I talked about PCOS I said how many of you know about PCOS and everyone was like this and I said but what if I told you you all already know how to solve it and they do because all of the your audience knows and follows your your diet your keto diet the low-carb diet with intermittent fasting because I know you talked quite a bit about it so all everybody listening to us already today knows how to help people with PCOS because a lot of people put up their hand and they don a daughter or a sister or a friend it has eCos I get messages all the time I friends whose daughters or stepdaughter top PCOS already I mm-hmm so when you when you do research and the medica the you know you type in PCOS and Google right the first two or three pages you old same old by just the same old narrative where they weathers one of this one of the characteristics of PCOS is or associations is they have high insulin but they don condition so their inability to locate cause and effect so it insulin and insulin resistance for those of you that are maybe possibly new watching this or let searching and they solution high insulin is underneath a lot of problems when you get it checked they don going to the doctor they high glucose and that is not going to show up through the I mean in other words you insulin actually takes many many years to raise the blood sugar so it brewing the oven builds up and then one day oh I insulin is one of the first things that actually occurs and the way to understand this is just look at the opposite okay what what what does the diabetic what happens with diabetes what happens when you have like with the diabetic you want to actually lower insulin and then you you know it just like when you really understand what happens with insulin and how it affects men and women then it very very obvious but I think the relationship between maybe you can explain this why do women have an increase of androgen when they have high insulin what connection I can explain that thank you very much and I know that you like to keep things simple and so do I so I appreciate that but I did write a review it you look at the scientific literature because I did write a review called for the Journal of insulin resistance so it which I like it well but it hyperinsulinemia the hyperandrogenism of women with PCOS so basically how much does high insulin contribute to the high the expression of high male hormones and women that that found that the in fact scientific literature does connect the high insulin to the high male hormone so it they know it but yet a treatment which is what you were just saying a little while ago the treatment doesn the root cause at all so when a young woman or an older woman women of all ages really they show up to their doctor with PCOS they they there they a million different expressions so it a symptomatic treatment as we know right very well they have acne like I did they given the pill if they or they another bill to treat acne if they have diabetes which I did they were given by these medications if they have hypertension they medication if they pregnant like you said they fertility drugs and then if they have a little bit of depression and anxiety around this condition they that as well and I could go on and on and on and then if they are one of the many women to develop cancer associated with this I did I had thyroid cancer and you got to go through that treatment and then you drug but they have to take forever and ever right so the treatment even though we have connected the dot and I can explain to you what what going on basically there are these cells in the ovaries called Becca that produce testosterone so more in the and our ovaries their way in there in our bodies this is basically diabetes of do overs as they call it our ovaries have all these insulin receptors and it makes sense that they do if you look at I at all animals all animals have insulin receptors in the ovaries it the body to know inside if there enough nutrition out there for us to make babies I guess it conversation with the outside world right the ovaries doesn it there so there are a lot of insulin receptors in the ovaries when you have too much insulin it over produces testosterone and you don insulin also has a major effect on our liver we all know this but one other thing that it does in the liver is it reduces the production of another molecule called sex hormone binding globulin which is within a molecule that binds his sex hormones so then again to testosterone so it not only are you over producing testosterone in the ovaries but you under producing the molecule that going to bind to the testosterone and make it inactive so now you have more testosterone roaming around but you have more active and free testosterone to go around and do what you don do all over your body so you don it to go to your skin and your hair and express itself as as it does in women right if the male hormone expressing itself in women and all of this is because of the insulin this is in the literature so if you want to have a look at that if you like reading this kind of stuff it insulin resistance well it the treatment doesn insulin it is devastating for a woman to actually have lose their hair or the facial hair they acne that I mean it it so when you understand the cause and effect relationship now as far as things that someone can do to lower insulin we know lowering the carb low carb diet will do it what are some other things that people can do basically and this is important right this is why words much time talking about insulin because mostly for like oh I don about that I just want to hear the solution it understand the root cause you important I understand that would find a lower insulin and that insulin is what causing all of these things in including the obesity that might be associated with it the central obesity like we talked about it diabetes any infertility and and possibly the cancers and everything else but seems to dementia Alzheimer and I know you talk about all these things so how do you lower insulin you lower insulin in one of two ways you eat less often because every time you eat no matter what you eat you produce insulin it drive this point home PCOS women do not eat more so that eat less move more olds calorie and calorie out theory is not going to work and this is what frustrating because most women are still being told at their doctor have to you you want to get pregnant or you want to whatever eat less move more they they eating too often they carbs eCos women have a lot of cravings alike RB foods because their insulin is high the higher your insulin this is physiological there up here I speak from experience my entire life until I was in my 30s I never ate a vegetable and I never ate a piece of me I didn want it all I wanted was I have to charge my before we shut off there you go all I wanted Evert was carved it was fruit bread pasta rice and any junk I could get my hands on lots of sodas lots of milk a lots of it was just carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon and I ate all the time why and I see this in PCOS women all the time as I had rebounding hypoglycemia and because I was thin it was always the impression that well she doesn doesn thought I - and because I kept Ethan I didn going into my organs I just couldn outside so PCOS women even more often and they graze a lot they crave a lot so here that I have so two things two ways to lower insulin eat less often and eat foods that are gonna create less of an insulin response so higher healthy fats appropriate amounts of protein and lower carb so the ketogenic diet is perfect it was perfect for me that my journey okay here are smart too so what are they going to do you substitutes I can have bread I can still craving the insulin is still high when they start their journey even if up here they they have the information you look for the substitutes they look for the sweeteners they look for the low carb breads and everything else which is going to be an issue because all of these things are going to raise your insulin you have to figure out how to eat in time restricted eating windows you have to eat meals that satiate you and you walk away you need clean periods between meals this is the most important thing in my opinion so it low carb diet with appropriate intermittent fasting periods yeah I think the secrets of this whole thing is that just to let people know when you do this your hunger your cravings go oh wait and that makes it easy to do you not going to be struggling you going to be like starving all the time not at all you once you which is a whole new concept yes Wow so this one thing that this book here and I link down below I it sure it will be soon but it for pre-order and it comes out April 14 of 2020 okay cool well I the one of the first copies you can you don and you know I buy a lot of books and if there put that down I I need something with the images you have a lot of diagrams helps people understand quickly and you can really visualize it so well done and I know how hard it is to write a book it you weeks and months and yeah so well done I don well I wrote the book with Jason Jason 5 is an experienced author and he he to tell you that it was a challenge and experience that I highly appreciate right exactly you completed and I could imagine but he you know in the end he just wants a good quality book he wants he doesn you know just up whatever it has to be perfect everything has to be perfect has to fit in and so I my first book may be my only book ever who knows I have no plan of hiding another one anytime soon Jason so I appreciate it and I want to tell you that you actually have you you I think you might be one it have a coffee I don copy I know you this is it because it says an advance copy and yeah yeah and this is uh yeah I I think I have the only one actually I in Portugal right I you send a copy doing it as you know I reached out to you right away so you yours is the very first one that I have seen wow this is great I time goes on it more but I to thank you for coming on and sharing this is going to help a lot of women that are struggling through this just realize this is not difficult to solve if you have the true information it right in here it there that talk about PCOS and they explain all the characteristics but they don solution so this is like you know what there is something that can work for you yeah I know as I said earlier I started off pretty but our book is all about exactly that what solution it is a practical guide it has a lot of good information a lot of good science there that people just can refute I hope and as I said if you go into the scientific literature it there before we wrote the book I did the review the review supported the writing of this book really and so then there a real good practical while I proud of it I a practical guide because it has recipes that has shopping list it has all kinds of stuff so you probably haven did say that and I was like wow they have boy you guys just went all out and just put everything in here this is awesome because there isn know but there you know at least in my research for four years really there really isn this specifically even though a lot of people speak about PCOS in their pictures I find a lot of doctors talk about insulin resistance whenever they have diagrams insulin insulin resistance in the middle and they have little bubbles going out there obesity cos is always there fatty liver or sleep apnea it don is like I had two children thanks to reversing PCOS well maybe we get to talk about what happens if you get pregnant with PCOS and you don you thought we did about that okay yeah it do another one of these just on pregnancy because oh my gosh this is like that make sure your health and your diet is correct because that predicts the future of that child you you better know what you are you going to be struggling with all sorts of issues and so the child so we we my daughter-in-law lives with us and so she we made sure her diet was really really clean so this child Lucy came out like a super baby I mean just incredibly healthy yeah she does get sick of cage but she she pops out of it like that but talk about a healthy child so I doing more videos on that but I want to thank you for your time and I think a lot of people are gonna be helped I put the link down below and the PCOS plant awesome thank you so much you	Success
Does the Sun Cause or Prevent Melanomas?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzF-_79YQRI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so there controversy over this topic of sun exposure and melanomas on one hand there the Sun on the flipside of that 69% of the population has vitamin D insufficiency so what do you do you caught between a rock and a hard place well I put a very interesting study down below that you should read and this is a summary of it they difference between moderate sun exposure versus getting a sunburn non-burning sun exposure is associated with a decreased risk of melanomas okay whereas people in the category of getting a sunburn which is associated with doubling the risk of melanomas okay so as long as you don you have lower incidence of melanomas versus indoor workers and it says ciao hurry in 2014 performed a meta-analysis of data from 73 cohort studies with 849 thousand participants and 22 randomized control trials with 31,000 participants so there this study the study found an inverse association of circulating vitamin D with risk of death due to cardiovascular diseases cancer and other causes so check out the study I put the link down below but realize that the radiation that you get from the Sun that potentially could cause damage in your DNA and alter the DNA sequences can also be at the same time protected from vitamin D because vitamin D has a protective function as well among many other functions anyway I put some additional interesting videos in vitamin D on this page right here go ahead and check them out	Success
What is Blood Pressure?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meLPsIqeGPw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so blood pressure what is blood pressure well first of all it measuring two things you the heart heart contraction uh pressure it systolic should be 120 um amount of pressure and U 80 is the diastolic that and that relax so if this is high then the person the heart is like it it down and turning off enough this is too high we get too much contraction this is controlled by the sympathetic part of the nervous system and this is controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system okay so that an adrenal problem you problem with the systolic going too high at before the diastolic so make note of that because that thing you should know about when you do your evaluation now pulse rate the pulse rate is the number of times the heart will beat in a course of a minute normal it should be 72 the more fit the person is it should go down to 60 50 maybe even 40 okay but if the person is not exercising and they overweight whatever and it means it high they control and they down and so that graph that going to the left it look at the HRV graph if the small dial which should be here you it go right here as they lose that parasympathetic the pulse rate will go higher and higher higher because it can uh problem that can cause a high puls rate would be potassium deficiency and why would they get a potassium deficiency not just because they eating enough potassium from the food because they have to have 7even cups but they depletes potassium refined carbohydrates uh will deplete potassium uh cheesecake might deplete some potassium if there pulse rate goes higher and higher higher and the person beat boom boom boom boom in their ear so they need to H add more greens and then avocado whatever and then we have to avoid the sugar so that talk about with blood pressure	Success
How to Deal With Food Cravings By Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Ld_fI7-SU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so as we debug the weight loss we look for energy levels we look for sleep problems we look for digestion and then we a good indication that there wrong in the body that something missing and it if you you you so this is a very good indicator that we need to fix it okay because when you burning fat you so it just kind of it just tells us that their diet isn craving sweet that deficiency we need to have seven to ten cups of vegetable per day to get rid of potassium deficiencies but if they already are eating potassium enough it could be just a complete adrenal burnout mainly the inside of the adrenal and they need l-tryptophan to increase the serotonin which is the pleasure hormone yeah okay so um they reduce stress and then we have starches that would be like potato and pasta and mac and cheese and all those wonderful pleasure foods that people are addicted to that a b vitamin deficiency so give them nutritional yeast make sure the potassium is in there as well but they might need l-tryptophan too to increase serotonin to give them that comfort feeling and we might even want to increase dopamine too by that product that we talked about before but start with this right here now salt if they crave salt then we know the adrenal is losing salt and salt buffers the ph and it transports carbon dioxide so it actually helps breathing so we having a consume sea salt as long as they need that salt because it going down so sometimes if they deficient in salt they tired as well salt salt could even be one reason why it could be cramping that it can cause a problem with that so make sure they out a lot and they need more salt as well now fat if they crave fatty foods deep fried foods deep fry catfish with tartar sauce fried chicken i have a history of craving fat not that i ever give in to my cravings but that means that the person has a liver gallbladder bile thing they absorbing the fats of vitamins thereby they satisfied so again give them the bile and that will handle it through the gallbladder formula now what about chocolate what if they crave chocolate that would be an l tryptophan thing give them that and that that will increase serotonin this means the adrenal is needs more serotonin because it know what magnesium actually is used to build l-tryptophan so you could also give the magnesium two for chocolate cravings okay but again if you fix the adrenal you just handled this one this one this one and this one yeah okay sour if they crave sour or lemon they have a choline deficiency and their choline is needed to make this neurotransmitter called acetylcholine and acetylcholine is essential for sleep and awake cycles and also to support something called the parasympathetic nervous system and that that helps you sleep so the best remedy would be to give them a lot of lemons um and a lot of you can even give them choline which is actually a lemon tasting vitamin they it choline and they the other thing that you can give them is nutritional yeast to increase the acetylcholine and that will help the b vitamin given the b vitamins to make more acetylcholine but typically they to help consume choline to actually strip off the liver so people that have a fatty liver will a lot of times crave sour because they foods to dissolve the fat on the liver now if they crave ice that deficiency so make sure they anemic or pregnant or whatever or have a digestive problem but usually if they crave ice that they so just go outside in the backyard and give them a teaspoon of dirt okay caffeine that is uh you give them uh recommend a phenol parasitan that they can get if you if they want to come off caffeine i just recommend and reduce it i don always recommend this but you if you need it you can give it to them but when you take caffeine from chocolate or from tea or coffee it depletes calcium and b1 just fyi so just look for those deficiencies they might show signs of those deficiencies alcohol as a substitute i like to give them kombucha tea because that actually helps gives the same texture as beer and you can also give them that dopa mu it in that african bean to actually help them come off alcohol and drugs it it stimulates dopamine which is the pleasure and reward system of the brain now if they need more bile they need more fat cycle vitamins because they fats msg monosodium glutamate will just increase potassium the opposing mineral to help balance that out and then you going to have to educate them on what this is what food that it that this will increase insulin by 300 percent so the food manufacturing companies purposely put that in the food to make you addictive and they and it makes the food taste better than it really is so they can get away away with selling crap and make it taste good it crap that tastes good crazy okay stress eater we have a lot of stress eaters out there so a good remedy would be magnolia that relora but just look for a product that says magnolia and that a chill pill and it helps them every time they go through stress okay so use this flow chart for cravings and we factor	Success
Dr. Berg's Opinion on the Coronavirus	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_qmjTJ6RLQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hi guys I quite a few people to do a video on the corona virus I opinion on it let me just get something in red right here okay so what is the corona virus when we the virus that talking about a mutated virus 2019 the n which means novel or new coronal virus for v ok this is the city where it originated from potentially from some seafood the they really don tremendous amount about this virus yet but what you need to know is that kronole viruses in general are very common so there of corona virus this specific one is a mutated virus and the mutation is something that gets altered this life not passed on through generations and generations the common thread with all these corona viruses is that they attack the lungs okay and I several aspects of this virus first thing you need to know is a virus is not necessarily a living thing it cannot reproduce without hijacking your own cells so it leeches or hijacks your DNA machinery from your cell and then it turns on a little copy machine and it starts reproducing like crazy so that what it does so a virus is like a parasite and what I mean by a parasite is it takes something from you but it doesn of like a criminal now with the good bacteria that lives in your digestive system you give them a home you give them food but they give you vitamins they give you certain compounds that are beneficial for your immune system so they exchanging good things with you but these viruses just don other point I want to bring up is the topic on glucose sugar the flu virus infection depends on cellular glucose there study I they found that when you increase glucose you increase the flu infection rate now I virus lives on glucose but it might there there thrive in a glucose filled environment so what would be the opposite fuel of glucose fat fuel or ketones right so ketones are really beneficial to support a healthy immune system now when you combine fasting you can actually put your body in a tappa gene and one of the purposes of etapa G which goes beyond just recycling damaged protein is cleaning up microbes bacteria viruses parasites from your body so a fasting is very very beneficial also when you do prolonged fasting you can increase stem cells for the immune system and basically grow a new immune system as well as strengthen your immune system too and unfortunately right now the news is blowing this up all over the place okay it internet it they epidemic threat to society or it might even turn into a pandemic event an example of an epidemic would be some sudden spike in a virus throughout the country pandemic is more a worldwide spread event now I did two different videos okay but I down below one on the bubonic plague which is in 1840 if I the other one is the Spanish flu which was also a pandemic event in 1918 and I tell you what really happened because the way that they is saying is that this virus just floats around and infects everyone and kills everyone but that let plague or the black plague what occurred just before that event and by the way this is based on some autopsies which they found this grave site and they dug up these bodies they found a higher incidence of rickets injuries to these bodies and other types of things that show nutritional deficiencies okay so there was a war involved which I back to in a second but there was also right before that a massive volcano which covered the sky with this cloud of smoke that obstructed the Sun so you had a change in vitamin D levels number one number two there was a huge problem in growing plant food so right there you can create two things one is nutritional deficiencies from the food that you eat and number two just not enough Sun and that can actually really affect your immune system vitamin D has a major influence over your immune system there are vitamin D receptors in the nucleus of your cells there are vitamin D receptors in your white blood cell it modulates your immune system which means it can control it to a large degree and many different types of viruses and microorganisms epstein-barr virus hepatitis B virus cytomegalovirus even TB which is a bacteria have an interesting strategy of blocking your vitamin D receptor and not allowing vitamin E to work that well in your body which allows them to thrive so with viruses there susceptibility factor for the virus to set in and take over and this explains to why some people get sick and some people don their vitamin D levels their stress level and their strength of your immune system now the Spanish flu in 1918 was also very very interesting because it was a global thing so if you look at what happened just before that it was World War one what happened with World War one you had this huge shift in transportation of food and also preserving food with things like canned food and creating food that refined without nutrients and this was a worldwide thing so you have this huge global shift of food from fresh food to preserved foods now what difference well a major drop in nutrients okay also the peak at when most people died during the Spanish flu was smack dab right in the middle of winter January interesting and there was some other factors as well one was that they didn effect of aspirin and so they were giving people massive amounts of aspirin and what happens is that can create a toxic effect with your lungs and actually create bleeding of the lung and you can actually die simply because you again I want to really bring up this point this important point in the susceptibility to pulling in this virus and actually having it manifest and this just explains why some people contract it and get sick some people don other fascinating point is with influenza there are over three hundred thousand to six hundred thousand people who die globally from the flu okay now in America 30,000 to 60,000 people die now if we compare America based in the population with other countries that have died of the flu you find some really interesting information in America we have double the rate of deaths from influenza than any other country yet we spend the most money on medical care vaccinations and we supposed to have the best health care well according to that we have a bit of conflicting data and I really think it has to do with a combination of all the junk food and the amount of sugar and the amount of refined food that Americans eat which assess people up for having a weak immune system okay on this chart I am showing you different things that cause you to die on a monthly basis okay so with the corona virus 25 people have died per month roughly okay now check this out aspirin 250 people a month die from aspirin that of coronavirus look at ultra genic deaths 20,000 this means deaths from medical treatment whether it from surgery medication or getting infection hospital that you die 20,000 people a month die from this and this is just in the United States and these other ones are global okay check this out the flu influenza 38,000 people a month die from influenza look compare this to the corona virus it doesn compare but the news is blowing this so far out of proportion why don talk about this or this or even that look at this HIV virus 49,000 people a month die from HIV that than this isn people die from car accidents these stats dominate this number right here now check this out 1 million people die from heart disease every single month Wow it just seems like there of a distortion of what there should be emphasizing and also all the stress that panic is going to cause people to get in car accidents and increase this rate not to mention more stress with a heart the only point I have to put things in the right proportion ok so what can you do number one keep your immune system really really strong take more vitamin D also zinc is very very important for the immune system if you that wash your hands limit the exposure next thing I would do is I would get on a healthy keto plan nutrient-dense foods I would do fasting that would be very very important and the last thing limit the amount of news that you watch that keeps your adrenals so revved up and stressed so that way you can keep your stress at a good level thanks for watching	Success
The #1 Thing Missing in Addiction Recovery	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AupL5gTil8o	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I that is missing when you recover from an addiction now if you recovering from alcohol for example you have to realize that in your body alcohol acts as a carbohydrate even though it carbohydrate now they put carbohydrates in it like beer wine and things like that mixed drinks but pure alcohol ethanol is not a carbohydrate which means you blood sugar issues okay because your body is constantly trying to get rid of it it considers it a toxin so it pulling it out as a priority and there a lot of liver issues and things like that so the symptoms from that alone from the blood sugar highs and lows are gonna be anxiety fatigue moodiness definitely craving dizzy and confusion so if you Anonymous for example you replace the alcohol for carbohydrates okay because donuts sugar in the coffee cookies candy load you up with carbohydrates so you never really get rid of this blood sugar problem realize what we chemical imbalance whether it alcohol those things are pulling nutrients out of your tissues and what I mean by chemical imbalance is a nutrient imbalance nutrient deficiencies big-time and there blood sugar fluctuation called insulin resistance and when you have insulin resistance you have difficulty absorbing nutrients in the first place so not only is the alcohol creating a deficiency but the insulin resistance is also on top of that blocking your ability to absorb nutrients so it keeps things completely out of balance I would run your body on ketones okay ketones are an alternative-fuel ketones are a byproduct of burning your own fat your body loves ketones and prefers ketones but way over glucose when you were in ketosis which means you these symptoms completely go away you just feel much better now how do you do it you have to lower your carbs but you want to be on a healthy keto eating plan so you want to lower your carbs and then you want to do fasting in a minute fasting what interesting about fasting is that it will also put your body into a healing mode so you start repairing the insulin resistance so now you start absorbing nutrients but you do have to realize that this process even though you gonna feel better right away takes quite a bit of time to correct especially if you a long period of time so you may need to do this for some months if not years to really see the full benefits but you be feeling good so you want to want to continue it the other thing that I think is very very important in the meantime while you you actually take key challenge them self okay you can get them in a supplement or through something called NCT oil that will turn into ketones so these are called exogenous ketones or ketone salts you take them your brain starts feeling a lot better it makes it easier to be successful long-term especially because there are a lot of symptoms that are associated with withdrawals and physiological cravings for certain things so you want to satisfy the body with the right fuel that number two you want to give it certain nutrients the best source of the b-complex is nutritional yeast what you want to do is you want to be consuming this all day long it have large amounts of it you feel better from it next thing is trace minerals trace minerals are also very important in many different things but you become deficient in trace minerals when you consume alcohol or take drugs as well but it C is also important but don that you would get at the you know drugstore that get a food base a natural vitamin C complex you want to keep taking these for a period of months and months until your body comes to a balance date I think the implementation of these basic things is this basic diet is not emphasized enough in these rehab programs so I highly recommend you try it so you can actually see for yourself and then you how to basic video on this page check it out	Success

Serious Excess Calcium Side Effects (Soft-Tissue Calcium) Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-oDjYNmKgo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	okay so this is fascinating I kind of stumbled on this um the other day and I wanted to kind of uh connect the dots for you um I started looking at all these things and there denominator excess calcium now when I say excess calcium I calcium that it necessarily um just because you have too much calcium let calcium it everything up because it it and there called hyper calcemia in the blood um and the calcium is going in inside the cell inside the cell and outside the cell you have 10,000 times the concentration of calcium outside the cell so when that calcium starts going inside the cell intracellular calcium that also talking about that too okay so when I talk about excess calcium I in the wrong place of your body all right we calcium in the bone all right so look check this out this is incredible um let through what calcium can do um hey that rhymed okay so let here angina chest pain calcium causes stimulates the sympathetic nervous system that causes contraction of the smooth muscle the cardiac muscle and the nerve the nerve muscle the nerve not the nerve muscle but the neurology uh so too much calcium can cause a cramp of the heart and cause uh angina chest pain and even a a heart attack because the heart is Contracting too much and it they don magnesium okay now arhythmia too much calcium but just so you know low calcium could also cause arhythmia too but more likely it affects the electrical cognitivity of the heart so you have atrial fib is too much calcium and the heart rate too high too much calcium you can even have a stroke because it excess calcium will stimulate too much fibrin and that goes in there and it starts plugging stuff up because remember calcium is kind of like the cement that patches stuff up in the body and if there for example it goes in there cause plaing and aosca plaing and it plugs up the arteries so it but it up and then this alone will cause a heart attack all right high blood pressure why because the the arteries are not elastic anymore and you to get U like an adrenal problem would be excess cortisol will cause high systolic blood pressure first so excess calcium okay um now fibroids I did a whole video on this and I talked about Calcium deficiency what I should have done is clarified it means unavailable calcium because it up in the cells and it it would be deficient but fi uh calcium controls the communic of cells and if that calcium loses control then the cells plorer and they uh they they start duplicating and start growing and you start getting tumors and fibroids and polyps and pimples and cancer and from the loss of U control of calcium okay um calcium stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and that therefore it messes up the parasympathetic so you a bladder valve problem because of the autonomic nervous system now you can relax and contract that bladder muscle so you retention yet it all the valves are controlled with the autonomic nervous system so if calcium is too much it an imbalance with your autonomic nervous system you at night and you valve problem and then we got cramps one cause of um cramps is too much calcium we talked about that in another video and then you called soft tissue calcification and soft tissue calcification that arteries is plaque the joints is spurring and grinding and popping and clicking in stiffness and all the iises like burtis tontis uh arthritis all the iises because there are going all over the place stenosis that column uh is getting smaller because there the canal and then tetany which is twitching underneath the left eyelid cataract that joint clicking all excessive calcium itching in hives is excess calcium constipation is excess calcium why because what people use magnesium for constipation because it lowers the calcium and relaxes the colon uh you can be very fatigued if you have excess calcium decrease reflexes weak so we have uh the smooth muscle you lose tone with with too much calcium and that the colon It actually just kind of gets all flabby and congested because of excess calcium so you get a hypo smooth muscle contraction um and and what muscle you have the bronchial tubes you have um the arteries and the heart you have the the colon all that is effective affected and now we have insomnia with too much calcium so be you can anxiety depression 30% of the time is from hypercalcemia so that give the person more magnesium for that uh bronchial constriction boom excess calcium um asthma why because calcium when it ionizes and it goes into the tissues it helps the mucous membranes it protects you against a lot of different things but if it everything up you get asthma and you get the chronic cough at night so you this chronic cough um and then mucous membranes are all um swollen of the colon of the sinus and the lung so we get a lot of mucous membranes problem in the colon and viruses come out of remission when you get excess calcium too canker sore yeah that excess calcium so here stimulate sympathetics causes contraction of smooth muscle calcium channel blockers are used for the heart for high blood pressure why don root of it they never do that magnesium is the natural calcium channel blocker because it opposes calcium High sympathetic dominant causes low parasympathetic all right let about the causes I stop consuming calcium unless it calcium carbonate and the person is taking a lot of calcium but many times the root cause of excess calcium is a lack of fat soluble vitamins because people are avoiding fat they think it bad but fat C vitamins are needed to transport the calcium uh like vitamin f is all the essential fatty acids in fish oil and these essential fatty acids are converted to an available type of essential fatty acid it conjugated linolic acid CLA with some microbes in your gut so there could be a digestive problem that you to utilize this fat so low vitamin F That oils low vitamin K2 we did a video on that um even low vitamin D can cause that but I want to explain this because high vitamin D will cause hyperal calcemia as well so let me kind of clarify what I mean by that if the person has low vitamin D the parathyroid gland will overreact it parathyroid gland will overreact and Spike the vitamin D Storage in that gland and then that hyper calcium state so there chain of reactions so with this situation you can have too much or too little vitamin D depending on what going on the other thing too is let say you don gallbladder you any of these fats so it doesn matter so you want to kind of keep going deeper and deeper and deeper till you find the root problem but I put a lot of people on omega-3 fatty acids official oils K2 vitamin D uh for excess calcium and it things right here okay now we also have um cortisol stress can cause this as well because it makes the body alkaline calcium can okay so we have to acidify and that why apple cider vinegar ionizes calcium for cramps and it it gets rid of cramps because it mobilizes calcium and it good for a lot of different things um all right low hydrochloric acid in the stomach could also be the source of excess calcium and um so that what really um it really needs a lot of this fat because it runs on oxidized fatty acids not on glucose it runs on fat all right so I hope this helped and it might be a little complex so you might have to watch this multiple times	Success
Insulin is the Cause of Most Major Illnesses Â Dr. Berg on High Insulin Levels	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmhvx9uCV-8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so the first thing you need to know is that insulin controls Sugar by lowering sugar in the bloodstream so insulin comes in and takes the sugar out of the blood and it puts it in storage and our bodies only have roughly probably one maybe two teaspoons depending on how big you are of sugar in the entire circulation so it anything more than that is toxic and your body will instantly convert it will convert the sugar to fat and cholesterol now this is a one-way Street fat is not then converted back to Sugar it doesn that so fat um is broken down into other things like fatty acids and ketones but it back so once it to stay there for a while and uh so sugar is one of the biggest c culprits for obesity hands down now excess insulin will cause diabetes uh that why when your pancreas burns out and you don inject you with it because you the insulin and even the insulin goes too high it resistance it resistance so it doesn that the insulin might be there but your body considers it too it toxic when you have too much of that coming through the bloodstream uh that because you instead of changing the diet they just start to give you medication to help absorb more of this insulin so it really crazy so the point is that insulin too much insulin will cause diabetes cancer why cancer well in order to diagnose cancer they do what pet scans pet scans scan the body for areas of your body that there excessive amount of dig of sugar in cells because cancer cells live on sugar so guess what I would do if I had cancer or to prevent cancer I the insulin low I sugar and that the cancer okay now insulin is a type of hormone that makes things grow they makes things get bigger they cause tumors and if you want if there medical professionals listening to this it things get bigger estrogen and Insulin are anabolic they make things grow and that fibroids tumors and eventually cancer because uh if I had a fibroid or if I had something like that you can starve it off by not eating any more sugar but who does that um now polycystic ovarian um disorder that is a lot of different uh Cy in the ovaries um that too much insulin if they were to cut this down that problem would go away neurological memory uh there Diabetes Type 3 which actually destroys your brain uh one of the side effects from too much sugar and too much insulin is that you have peripheral neuropathy that your fingertips and your toes that you get numbness and tingling in your hands and feet so that then we have respiratory we have asthma allergies those are two side effects uh we talked about acne and boil those little bumps um also um you just get fat um high blood pressure cholesterol insulin converts to cholesterol and triglycerides way way more than any type of eating cholesterol will turn into cholesterol so these are some of the side effects that you that come from insulin as being the root cause for many many problems so I just want to touch on that so you have that basic information	Success
Could Your Snacking be a Medical Disease?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV1yv4vC1vo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	could you snacking or Benji be a medical disease in this video we out the newest eating disorder called binge eating disorder or bed published in the dsm-5 the diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders the fifth edition describes it in detail but let see if you have this disorder do you have excessive eating at least once a week for a period of three months do you eat every two hours have you been eating more rapidly recently are you eating until you uncomfortable sometimes do you ever eat alone you ever feel guilt after eating something that you know you shouldn have eaten or have you ever been on a fat diet where you group like you carbohydrates or dairy and have you ever engaged in sporadic fasting and binging I think they call that intermittent fasting well you know what you may be suffering from the binge eating disorder but don is a drug for that called vyvanse vyvanse is a new application of an old drug they use for some other things but it this disease and they improved it in only 12 weeks which is pretty fast now what was interesting about this drug is they pre-screened anyone with pre-existing heart conditions and took those people out of the study so we started with people with relatively good hearts but check this out these are the potential serious side effects sudden cardiac death stroke significant high blood pressure psychosis high rate of abuse seeing and hearing things and I have to say this for those of you that are new to my channel I am completely and utterly sarcastic I am NOT promoting this solution for this disease it opinion that snacking in binging is not a medical disease it is a normal thing that a lot of people go through and just did health Aikido combined with him in the fasting the need for snacks would go way way down so if you channel and you do have any of these and you don put a link down below of exactly what to do to fully handle the temptation of binging and snacking	Success
Early Signs & Causes of Appendicitis Explained by Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVS84yERyek	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let of appendicitis now first of all do we really need our appendix I mean isn just an extra organ well actually you do need your appendix it serves a very very important purpose it backup for when you get food poisoning and get diarrhea or you have some type of gut infection where you have diarrhea and you lose your good bacteria so there bacteria and immune factors that sitting in this appendix that will be released if you have diarrhea because your body wants to prevent the bad bacteria from stepping in and taking over so it the good bacteria so here we have the small intestine over here and it connects with a little valve called ileocecal valve and then you have the large intestine okay and the appendix is right down here and sometimes that can be blocked with various things even from a parasite or a stone or because your diet is poor you get inflammation and this closes down and then that gets infected and the early symptoms usually are going to be a sudden pain between the location of where your appendix is and your bellybutton so about two inches to the right of your bellybutton okay you right there or nausea or you have bowel changes diarrhea or constipation or pain around your bellybutton or you might have a low-grade fever because there but these are the early signs of appendicitis now remember when I was a kid I probably was seven years old and I was complaining of pain in my abdomen my mother took me to the hospital and I remember laying on this table and the doctors pressing around to see if there pressing right over this point and it hurt really bad and I didn anything so that could have been a potential big problem but it really wasn ate because I lived on sugar back then but I I went home and nothing ever occurred from that but there important things that you can do to prevent appendicitis and number one is making sure you have enough probiotics there probiotics out there you get one that survives the stomach but probiotics can act to protect the colon against infections so probiotics are really really really important in keeping your immune system really really strong and also making healthy lactic acid to prevent the unfriendly bacteria and things that can set in in the lower colon number two make sure you have enough fiber to feed these microbes okay and I would be a good thing number three cut the sugar down because pathogens love sugar and we want to avoid sugar thus the ketogenic diet right okay garlic is really good to kill off microbes and prevent infections in the large intestine time is an herb rosemary is a good natural antibiotic but it only really kills the bad guys not the good guys onion is good oregano is really really good and you can see all these herbs are normally in a pizza so go ahead and eat more pizza and being very very sarcastic you can put these on different foods different dishes meats things like that and radish radish is really really good as well apple cider vinegar is very healthy for the colon and fasting fasting gives your intestines a chance to chill out and also allows the food to cycle through so you 24/7 to set you up for appendicitis and lastly if you haven digestion I put it up right here it actually a very important video	Success
The Relationship Between Hepatitis C, Iron, and Cirrhosis Explained by Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwKoZk5OqtU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we relationship between hepatitis C iron and cirrhosis what are the symptoms of Hep C and by the way hepatitis E is the most common type of hepatitis and we talking about a specific virus so the main symptoms would be fatigue flu-like symptoms darker urine abdominal pain yellow skin eyes and there more now what is that there is a high rate of people with Hep C that also have high iron and when you have hepatitis C it makes it more difficult to get rid of iron so usually you and that iron creates oxidation and a lot of free radicals and that going to lead to inflammation and cirrhosis and not only that iron is needed to keep the virus that the problem in reproduction mode so it actually thrives on iron so there three things that I would recommend there can get it from the health food store probably online but it it which is in breast milk but it can be extracted from colostrum and cow and you can get it as a supplement based on certain studies which I put a link down below you don take less than 3.6 grams to create the effect because lactoferrin is a very powerful antimicrobial it also suppresses the replication of the virus in hepatitis C it binds to the virus it helps lower liver enzymes it helps lower inflammation it also increases phagocytosis which is part of the immune systems so it booster but what works it works by preventing iron to be available to the virus so it starving off the food for the virus which by the way it it cells so affarin can go in there in effect the DNA and the RNA and prevent the iron from being used by the virus and this is also beneficial to people with HIV cytomegalovirus epstein-barr virus and others I next thing that I would recommend for Hep C would be vitamin D there high rate of people who have Hep C that also have a vitamin D deficiency now whether that sunshine it could also be because they have instant resistance or they could have a defect in the vitamin d receptor and the last thing I recommend is fasting okay why because fasting strengthens your immune system if you do periodic prolonged fasting like 48 hours within 72 hours you stimulate stem cells and that will help you grow a new immune system also fasting stimulates the tapa G which has a function of cleaning up microbes including viruses now if you haven seen my videos in vitamin D and why you would be deficient I put this video up here check it out	Success
Significantly Boost Your Red Blood Cell (RBC) Production With.....	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLwPMnFBwSA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so let your red blood cell but before I talk about that I need to explain what a red blood cell does in your body they and they carrying oxygen and what they have in this red blood cell it with a bunch of hemoglobin and that basically filled with iron and it connects to oxygen so allows oxygen to be transported through the body and in one red blood cell you have 270 million hemoglobin molecules so it of oxygen that cell is carrying your body makes 2.4 million red blood cells every single second and they a factory inside your long bones a red blood cell will last between 100 and 120 days and it takes about one minute for a red blood cell to travel from your lung all the way through your body and back to the lung so what the red blood cell is doing it capillaries and it and it tissues that way and it comes back without oxygen and then you breathe and it gets reoxygenate it just does this over and over and over the interesting thing about the red blood cell is it has no nucleus that it has no DNA or RNA now what interesting about that is that viruses use your DNA to replicate so the viruses can cells now as far as the quantity of red blood cell you have between 20 and 30 trillion red blood cells that makes up 70% of all of your cells so you have a lot of red blood cells in your body the other interesting thing about the red blood cell is that it can for fuel it uses glucose now you might say well oh well where is that going to come from well your body can very easily make glucose it it could make it from ketones it can make it from fat it can make it from protein so you don need to consume glucose to feed your red blood cell now if you red blood cells like you whether you have an iron deficiency or a b12 deficiency and I don create a video on problems with your red blood cell at this point but if you do have not enough red blood cells you gonna be tired shortness of breath you weak because you you don oxygen through the body so now the question is what can you do to strengthen your red blood cells well first of all to make sure you have enough iron okay but not too much and you want to make sure you have b12 very very important okay but there and it training now what does that mean intermittent meaning you something and then not do it hypoxia meaning without oxygen or low oxygen training a lot of top athletes do this and there whether they use a mask when they working out or they they have a hypoxic tent there different ways to actually do this training so basically you starve oxygen to the body for a little bit and then you breathe back in forth now what I like to do is I like to use a hypoxic mask not what I of exercises where I very much I like to do it when I hopping and puffing so I will wear this mask for about two minutes and then I take it off for two minutes and I it on for two minutes and I my oxygen I hyperbaric oxygen therapy which is really really cool because it puts oxygen into your brain into your tissues it about this therapy it opposite we first you might think wow this is a stupid thing to do but if you really understand what actually quite smart when you starve the body of oxygen for a short period of time not a long period of time you trigger certain genes that create significant changes within the red blood cell you increase the red blood cell production by up to ten times so instead of making 2.4 million red blood cells every single second you making 30 million red blood cells every second that is HUGE you also increase the size of the red blood cell now what is the significance of this you more oxygen so when you do a workout or exercise you when you sleep you you sleep and also there therapeutic benefits to things like chronic lung disease or asthma or hypertension diabetes or even Parkinson oxygen to the tissues and if there area of your body that well this can help it it will also stimulate your antioxidant reserve especially in the heart and that this therapy is also a cardio protective as well as neural protective so if you want more information about in a minute hypoxic therapy I created a video it right here check it out	Success
How to Stop Panic Attacks? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyHpd9fh_WQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let attack okay now over the years working with a lot of different people there been quite a few people who came in my office with panic attacks and they are always on the same diet which I to discuss but a panic attack is a severe anxiety it okay it suffocating and so here that you should do number one slow down your breathing if you notice someone in a panic attack they inhalation is different than the exhalation they could be doing like the exhalation is usually shorter so you want to breathe in for maybe five seconds and then breathe out four to five seconds to keep that the same and slow it down that you out of this panic attack it pull you out of what or flight mechanism because you have the adrenals involved the adrenals of the stress clan there going on in your brain you have something called the amygdala and it very similar to the adrenals because it mechanism they found that when you remove this structure in the brain you lose all your fear so one purpose of the amygdala is involved in fear and that mechanism it snake that away if you have no fear chances are you might not survive as well to take long walks about 40 minutes to 60 minutes every single day get out there nature gets tons and tons of space and lots of oxygen number three stop watching the news you don you don you need a lot of lots of space and probably need to watch a comedy and before vitamin b1 is very necessary in countering stress when you deficient you will have severe and xiety and take a well guess what depletes b1 refined carbohydrates people that have either panic attacks or anxiety attacks are always on a refined carb diet they sugar they might be doing a lot of coffee tea and things with sulfates as in wine and other foods that have sulfites all deplete vitamin b1 casaba will deplete vitamin b1 so you take a good amount of nutritional yeast if you had severe anxiety or a panic attack also consuming the African silkworm will deplete you of b1 I know it that you cut down on the consumption of silkworm also consuming the larvae of insects high-end diamond ace could be a problem as well so you want to limit your consumption of that chu they may do that in certain parts of Africa okay number five acupressure very powerful it can pull someone out of that panic attack very fast all right number six adaptogens these are herbs that help you adapt to stress they calm down the sympathetic nervous system they lower cortisol they help you just regulate stress alright guys thanks for watching and if you haven webinar or on the adaptogens I put both of those videos on this page	Success
7 Sneaky Viral Strategies That Hack Your Immune System	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE4X926W6x8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let strategies now these viruses are very very devious and a virus is much smaller than a bacteria now are they alive not really are they dead not really it one of those things where you have this this little sack with this tiny little copy machine and here it genetic copy machine that has the ability to copy itself over and over and over but it could only do that if it invades your cells into the nucleus of the cell and then leech onto it and suck the life out of your cell and then replicate that way certain cells that don anything like your red blood cells for example so that start reproducing and create a lot of damage within your immune system because your immune system ceases foreign invader now and it creates inflammation and it starts to create collateral damage alright so number one viruses can infect your own immune cells the B and T cells the monocytes and even your thymus and viral specific t-cells the thymus is right above the heart and it that help it for your white blood cells so it trains your white blood cells to defend against pathogens so these little guys can invade the thymus and other immune cells now what happens now is that virus kind of becomes part of your cell and it viewed as your own cell by your own immune system so that it goes underneath the radar and it doesn four viruses have the ability to escape antibody response so think about this a virus the shell of a virus has a little protein on it and it flag that your immune system can see in tag and go after right well these are special proteins or little flags can be hidden by the virus so our own immune system cannot find them and so you have this delayed immune response until after the infection has sent in very very sneaky all right here number five you can have two viruses invade one cell and then what they do is they work together to rearrange those proteins on the outside of the cell so they can escaped attack from our own immune system all right number six escaping what are signaling molecules for the immune system they responses and viruses can sometimes escape these little guys right here so there for your immune system to indicate that as a virus there all right number seven certain viruses can downgrade vitamin D receptors what does that mean it means that it blocks your ability to absorb vitamin D and vitamin D is intimately involved in controlling your immune system so without vitamin D you viruses and you don protection anymore so viruses have one strategy of suppressing the immune system by blocking vitamin D this is why you see so many diseases involved with an associated low vitamin D condition well that virus involved in that disease and if you haven bulletproof your immune system I put it up right here check it out	Success
The Low Potassium Epidemic: Dr. Berg Explains Symptoms, Signs, Diet, Causes, and Treatment	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epNcLy6knx4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys in this video we talk about low potassium why because potassium is probably the number one deficiency with most people but it hardest to detect because when you take a blood test most of the pottassium 98% of your potassium is inside the cell not outside the cell so when they do a blood test it unless it so the type of test that you would have to do would be an intracellular test it really ask for it doctors probably don even know about it but there is a test that you can do but I like to go by symptoms uh here are some of the symptoms of low potassium and by the way this is not vitamin K but this is a a chemical symbol of potassium it so when you blood pressure will increase why because pottassium is a physiological relaxer it uh muscle cramps because potassium is electrolyte sugar Cravings why because potassium helps you store Sugar and it will actually help you get rid of sugar Cravings um because the storage of of glucose uh needs potassium okay constipation yeah so that symptom of low potassium and then High insulin so there between sugar blood sugars diabetes and potassium in fact when you have enough potassium the need for insulin goes down so I always recommend potassium for uh diabetic clients number this is another one muscle weakness you could have this unexplainable muscle weakness and not know why why because the the electrolytes are needed to help the muscles contract and that an abnormal heartbeat because the heart is a muscle same thing with this muscle same thing with that muscle so these abnormal uh heart beats for example like um atrial fibrillation arrhythmias that deficiency of potassium and or magnesium okay anxiety and sleeping problems because potassium is something to calm you down so if you doesn that doesn you can start manifesting a lot of these symptoms now let causes lus potassium well if you are sick and you vomit or let Bic that can cause that or maybe you just not eating enough in your diet um now you might say well I eat bananas right well bananas only have 300 milligram you need 4700 mgram per day to hit your um your regular amount that you need so you would have to consume I don bananas 11 bananas so we don that sugar so what we want to do is we want to consume our potassium from vegetables from salad and you to need about 7 to 10 cups okay if you watch my other videos I talk about that it couple big salads if you don salad take kale maybe a little bit of berry blend it with water and drink your salad okay that there so we want to start to increase that and that the diet you better too because if you a Ain diet high protein uh you going to definitely need potassium you uh because uh you don potassium okay so ketosis is the state of fat burning when you fat no carbs and you could become deficient in potassium from that too so that always modify the ketosis diet and I make sure that we have enough greens and vet vegetables to help balance that and also potassium is necessary for the digestion and breakdown and buildup of protein so people that are losing their hair for example and they protein thinking that they get their hair back without potassium sorry it doesn diuretics say you medication well you your potassium and keep the blood pressure there interesting that one of the side effects so you better make sure that your diuretic is not pulling out potassium and you putting it back in okay High cortisol that stress stress can also deplete potassium in fact I testing on their potassium levels and they are eating a tremendous amount of potassium but because they this amount of stress their potassium stays low because with the adrenal it almost like you have a hole in the bucket and the pottassium goes right through so again when you stress you need even more potassium so anyway this potassium is really important uh I forgot when it High insulin will cause a low potassium and that to the list consuming sugar will deplete your potassium and you can even feel it in your heartbeat just go it starts to go boom boom boom boom fast you a strong heartbeat you can hear it in your inner ear that is a sign of low pottassium because you just ate a lot of sugar and uh you need to start consuming more salad to put that back so um and the last one is drinking too much water so this goes against what everyone says that you have to drink when you know you by the time you drink it late because you you when you drink too much water you create a condition called um hypot treia which is a dilution of all your electrolytes and then your heart starts get going out of balance and you can have a heart attack by drinking too much water so you want to drink when you don because you peeing out electrolytes you putting in electrolytes I like to hydrate my water with lemon a little bit of Ider vinegar maybe a little Stevia if it um or I drink filtered water so I just want to kind of give you an overall on this very common deficiency that people have in the symptoms so you can start

An Aging Face: Can Anything Be Done?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsPT7EOJkrE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so in this video we about the aging face okay is there any solution can you actually slow down this process unfortunately it everyone is going to age but if there something we can do to slow it down that would be a very good thing some people have accelerated aging other people don environment which I as well is the strength of your ability to recover and repair there are certain nutrients that are really necessary in the repair of your DNA and that relates to how fast you age but typically what happens as we age we start getting these horizontal and vertical lines or wrinkles on the forehead in between the eyes you especially on top of the eyelid starts becoming very very thin almost paper thin you can see it on the cheeks as well there loss of elasticity the ligaments that support the skin to the face are atrophying they the face starts to atrophy and you start losing that and starts to Sag underneath the ides right here you may also notice a dark circle underneath the eye as well and the tissue on top of the eye and the eyelid starts drooping you may also notice that the fat layer underneath the cheek bones becomes out rafi then you start sagging tissue and so you lose your cheek bones so you have the sagging eyebrows and the lids dark circles even bone loss around the face around the jaw and the teeth you potentially could also lose the fullness around the lips and there sheath muscle called the platysma underneath your your neck that becomes atrophied and you get that turkey gobbler appearance I think I starting to get that myself but other than the wrinkles the sagging skin the dark circles and that little turkey gobbler appearance you fantastic alright so let forget about that for a second and talk about what can we do to slow this thing down okay well there happening you have the breakdown of tissue and then have the building up of tissue okay I talking about proteins at the cellular level so you have the oxidation or the damaging of proteins that can definitely come from smoking smokers tend to age prematurely and then there is people who get excessive amounts of Sun including sunburns Sun Sun is good too much Sun could age the skin then you have the chemicals that are put on the skin as well as in your foods and I know a lot of women put up just layers of makeup on the skin on a daily basis and then you take it off you just want to make sure that those chemicals are non-toxic then you have alcohol that will age the skin in certain medications and recreational drug and then you have sugar and junk foods and refined carbohydrates those will definitely age your skin probably more than anything and then you have stress okay on the flip side what do we do to counter that this is what you should focus on regular exercise okay regular exercise that will counter this regular exercise will provide a lot of oxygen to the lungs to the tissues it will slow down the aging process especially on your face because it going to drive blood flow into the tissues fasting very very powerful I done to the videos on this in fact I going to put a link down below but fasting will do two things it increase your antioxidant Network to counter some of this stuff right here it genetic factors that help something called the tofu ji recycling old damaged tissue especially protein and giving you new tissue it especially if you do periodic prolonged fasting to actually help your body replenish old cells so you have less wrinkles also fasting helps your blood sugars and right there that reduce oxidation now consuming antioxidant foods are a must and that would be these things called vegetables especially cruciferous vegetables now there foods too like seafood and grass-fed meat and eggs as well but here thing when you talk about DNA repair and the nutrients required for DNA repair these are the key nutrients that are essential and I put some of the research down below vitamin b3 okay now the way that you become deficient is by training a lot of alcohol or sugar or or also consuming a lot of corn will cause a deficiency of b3 do you realize that the consumption of corn from the 70s to now has increased by 3x that crazy so we need b3 for DNA or pear also magnesium very necessary for DNA repair you can get magnesium from a lot of vegetables leafy greens things like that zinc very necessary for DNA repair shellfish seafood seek help boisterous full-length very important to prevent DNA damage and protect the DNA and this word folate comes from another word foliage which is vegetable so you get full light from vegetables and then DHA which is an omega-3 fatty acid it in salmon sardines cod liver oil and then you have vitamin C always make sure that you get it from a natural source vegetables would be a good source all right it increasing these and decreasing these if you haven Aging check them out I put them right here	Success
The Best Diet for a Healing Bone: Fracture, Surgery or Trauma	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moSq3Dr9MeE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let fracture what foods should you be eating once you had a fracture let had some trauma like I did with my shoulder and my elbow and my leg we actually broke the bone what foods would be best and this also includes some type of surgery where they had to cut your bone what what things you need to speed up the healing first let what happens when you break a bone it is quite fascinating how coordinated and organized your body is in healing a bone fracture in the perfect sequence of events first thing that happens is you have this blood clot around these two bones that have been broken and with that blood that rushes in you have all sorts of things you have white blood cells you have growth factors you have immune cells you have something called macrophages macrophages are very large phagocytes which are cells that eat things so the macrophage is going to do a lot of things it going to clean debris it increase inflammation initially and then later it inflammation the macrophage is essential and critical and making sure that this bone heals correctly it make sure that that bone becomes solid again if there down these macrophages it take longer and longer to heal it just happens what slows these guys down is high levels of sugar in the blood this is why diabetics take longer to heal so hyperglycemia high sugar in the blood or a high carbohydrate diet you know those things that they feed you at the hospital will slow down this white blood cell so we have the blood clot we have the inflammation then we have the stem cells that could activate it stem cells are undifferentiated cells their cells that don into any cells that you need so the stem cell can turn into bone some fibrous tissue or collagen so depending on what the body needs it may turn into one of these initially though the stem cell is going to form soft bone or like a splint to hold it together so it quickly goes in there and it will just start forming a kind of a soft bone now if there process it fibrin if there help from a cast or there it right away so then we osteoblasts kicking osteoblasts are those cells that build up bone that lay down bone okay if you can envision one of those stingrays in the ocean that hover around the the bottom of the ocean so this come in and kind of hover about and start depositing and making bone throughout this process you going to get new blood vessels forming new capillaries occurring the nerves are going to start to grow back if they were damaged you osteoclast worked as well the osteoclast cells have the opposite function where they getting rid of bone so after a while after the osteoblasts do their job you may see a callus well these guys are going to come in and they start cleaning up that little callus so it so they and remodeling and they after two weeks so these two cells go back and forth in the production as well as the remodeling of the bone now as far as what you need to eat we need to look at the composition of bone the raw materials that make up bone sometimes people think you know when you drink milk it is made out of calcium right well let take a look at how much calcium is in balance first of all one third of bone is made up of collagen and not non collagen even lipids like fats make a bone then you have one third is water and the last third is minerals so 48% of the one third would be calcium 37% is phosphorus 1.2 9% is magnesium and then you have silicon which is 0.12 percent and iron which is point 9% then you have a bunch of other trace minerals like zinc copper boron selenium manganese so even though these are needed in trace minerals that they minerals are very important in activating other enzymes to make this bone solid and work and functional so the raw material bone is not just about calcium it and also vitamins play a big part as well so the worst dot you on to heal the situation would be a high carbohydrate refined sugar low nutrient diet you want to consume nutrient-dense foods get low carb as in healthy keto and you want to definitely try to do some fasting that healing it okay so it formation of bone and other tissues as well vitamin E is gonna be really important you from leafy greens nuts seeds zinc it all about red meat or shellfish or seafood salmon would have zinc liver has zinc vitamin C sauerkraut you can do leafy vegetables I wouldn thing because we don sugar unless you alright vitamin d3 vital and vitamin k2 so both of these work together to make this bone really really solid vitamin D helps absorb the calcium in the blood k2 takes it from the blood and pushes it into the bone so some other really good things would be bone broth and then you have bone itself now you could just chew on a bone okay but it mess up your teeth but there are products or supplements that you can find which have raw bone which would be a really good thing to take to give you all of these and the right ratios I not going to recommend any brands you gonna have to do that research but the raw material of bone can help you build bone and then you have trace minerals really really important and the activation of the enzymes to help you repair this bone alright thanks for watching if you don imminent fasting I put some videos up here check them

Susceptibility to the Coronavirus? Facts Covered by Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjUOpvmDE7k	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today I susceptibility to the corona virus and other viruses in general of course right now in the news there are freaking people out about this virus all sorts of speculating headlines putting people in fear and worried and I just want to give my disclaimer nothing said in this video is meant to treat or cure this virus this is purely based on my opinion and there is some research done below I not gonna try to sell you a vitamin or any cure at all that being said let dive into this very interesting topic now did you realize that when someone sneezes about 20,000 little droplets containing viruses are projected through the air and that is the mode of transportation for a virus a virus does not have wings it doesn has to be propelled in the air it has to be contacted and put on your body surface and somehow invade the body and certain viruses have targets for certain tissues so if you can vision the virus like a tennis ball with these little spikes and these spikes have affinity for different tissues depending on what virus it is the corona virus has affinity for the lungs okay so it gonna go in the lungs and do its purpose now the Latin word for virus means poison now viruses are everywhere these biological entities are more abundant than any other entity on this planet just one liter of seawater contains over a hundred billion viruses so it really has to do with are you susceptible to the virus now the purpose of a virus is to deliver its DNA or RNA into the host cell your cell to be copied so it can actually continue now DNA and RNA are just genetic material so viruses can do anything without the host without you so they really dead they have the potential of acting like they lot of damage so if we take a look at your cell right here okay and the virus and this is definitely not in the right proportion cuz viruses are very very very tiny certain viruses are like forty four times smaller than bacteria and they go through five stages first one is they attach to your cell wall now realize that your immune system is looking for these guys and they so if you has a much easier job of attaching and penetrating this wall right here now the interesting thing about viruses is some viruses have this envelope around them that they take from your cell membrane cover themselves they actually steal it and they hide so they go underneath the radar so your immune system cannot find them so they attach it penetrate and then they go into the center part which is the nucleus you see they don any thing that can read this program let okay this little round disc and you trying to listen to music you going to be able to listen to music without some type of CD player right you need something to read it well the virus does not have a reader it uses your reader all it has is the CD or the DNA and it music it just wants to replicate okay like a copy machine so what it does is it penetrates it hits a nucleus it hijacks your copy machine the duplicator and when it does that it starts to reproduce at a very fast rate and this prevents your own body from using that machine so your own body can now not replicate anymore so that now we have the replicating stage and then the assemble stage so they to take different things modify their structure so then they can come out of the cell and hide from your own immune system that to do so they when they get released the cell usually dies now some viruses actually go dormant okay so that pretty much hang out and do nothing and they wait and they wait and they wait into you until you until you out and this is why so many people get virus outbreaks during stress dates because these viruses are dormant another interesting thing about certain viruses is they can activate glycolysis this is the release of sugar interesting I little bit but I do want to mention this one point in a study that I read which I you decrease glucose metabolism it weakens the influenza virus in laboratory tests now that interesting all right susceptibility okay there are several factors that make you susceptible or vulnerable to viruses in general age now here nothing you can do about getting older so you know let let there nutrient deficiencies there connection between nutritional deficiencies and the health of the immune system and the susceptibility for viruses but there on this one area right here and there not a lot of research there it down below well we in a second genetics well you can much about you genes you can do a lot about the epigenetics which involves your environment stress nutrition what you eat but you okay so we that all right number four you health of your immune system if your immune system is weak you vulnerable more susceptible to getting the virus and having it create more destruction the microflora in your digestive system also around your body has a huge influence on your immune system so when you take antibiotics or you sterilize the body you greatly increase the chance of getting infections so antibiotics steroids drugs chemotherapy all break down your immune system and make you weak so you can things off also if you have a pre-existing chronic disease that makes you susceptible to getting a virus number 6 stress I about this a little bit but stress significantly increases risk of infections and viruses I put some data down below your adrenal glands are really the gland that regulates your stress if we take a look at mice that had their adrenals extracted all sorts of problems with the immune system increasing risk of infections viruses if we also take a look at another condition called Addison where your adrenals are basically shut down they take adrenal hormones you of killer T cells in this condition interesting unique killer T cells to defend against viruses also your risk of infections the way up so the dream ills are definitely involved but this is the area I really want to focus on because you can influence this right here and you can also influence these with this so in other words you can strengthen your immune system this and this with this right here now there that happen when you have certain nutritional deficiencies number one it weakens your immune system so it makes your muses tomb weaker but nutritional deficiencies also make viruses become stronger now there interesting study I put it down below that talks about viruses are more virulent in selenium and vitamin E deficient mice which is actually quite interesting because you would think if you starve off this virus with nutrients it would become weaker but no it doesn it kicks in a certain gene that makes it stronger very similar to when we do fasting our bodies actually become stronger at least temporarily but because because you can too long so certain viruses can go from a virulent to view and virulent means able to infect the host so by taking away their nutrition they become stronger but it makes us weaker that now let want to just kind of touch on this one topic on age for a second now if we take a look at the fatality rate of the corona virus in this age group right here 80s and older you see a 14 point 8 percent death rate and let at if you comes way down to three point six percent death right if you 50s it 40s 0.4 that percent chance of dying once you infected I mean look at this 30s 20s or let percent chance okay this is extremely low this is really important to know because if you read the news they make it sound like everyone true let things here other viruses there twenty one thousand cases if we take a look at the fatality percentage is three point nine percent okay in 113 countries if we compare that to Ebola SARS and MERS look at this Ebola is 40 percent okay fatality rate SARS is nine point six percent MERS is thirty four point four percent so the corona virus actually has the lowest fatality rate at least of these four right here it information because sometimes again the news distorts things and it makes it sound like everyone that depends on the strength of the immune system and how strong you can resist it alright let nutrients involved in viruses in general one vitamin C that important vitamin of all vitamins for viruses it antiviral nutrient it decreases the time that you have a cold it decreases the risk of certain lung infections it can help decrease the susceptibility of getting an infection in general and it also can increase the white blood cell now china right now is doing a study on vitamin c in the actual city where the corona virus originated from they giving people 24,000 milligrams of intravenous vitamin c for seven days we but that viruses in general when you deplete your vitamin c that would make sense as a strategy because if you can decrease the vitamin c you can decrease the white blood cell vitamin c has the tendency to up regulate normal t killer cells vitamin c is also necessary to make interferon and interferon stops viruses by killing the infected cells so the cell that virus and it neighbors so it really will help wipe out viruses now one of the best ways to give item and see is through food and hands down the food that has the most vitamin C is sauerkraut normally a person needs between 70 and 90 milligrams of vitamin C today certain types of sauerkraut can give you up to 700 milligrams per cup so that really good source it peppers it and it number two vitamin E very very important in building up your resistance to viruses selenium another really important trace mineral zinc involved in over 200 enzymes but vital for your immune system and then of course you have vitamin D viruses have this interesting strategy to down regulate the vitamin D receptor because apparently somehow it knows that vitamin D is one of the key modulators for the immune system it helps control it and this is probably one of the reasons why people get sick in the winter in the flew more than during the summer because the Sun will give you vitamin D as far as getting selenium and zinc you can get that from fish and seafood vitamin E comes from vegetables nuts and seeds anyway this is a long video thanks for hanging in there if you have not seen my video on how to strengthen your immune system I put it up right here check it out	Success
My Best Tip for Figuring Out Health Issues	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz9NLpg8S08	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today I important tip to help figure out health problems now this is gonna be fairly short video but it so important it most important questions you can ask yourself or ask someone when figuring out a health problem it and never emphasized but it so this is the question what happened just before you experienced your health condition right there will always be some trigger it could be food-related could be some stress something going on in the environment I some examples had a patient come in with angina chest pain really bad she struggling with this for probably a week and a half it took me two seconds said when did it start she goes I don says we looking and then uh listen oh yeah it was on a Tuesday I said okay what time she said five o did you eat right before that she goes start looking and she remembered she ate a huge banana split and this is a true story it there was pressure on the liver and because the liver is right next to the heart it put pressure in the heart she went to the emergency room $40,000 later okay they found nothing and then she end up in my office later now somehow that event lingered on for a week and a half and I had to lay on the table did some gentle massage around her abdomen all the pain went away I never came back so that would be one example another example someone came in they started losing their teeth I said what happened just before that they looking they said nothing and I said well nothing did you change your diet oh yeah I became a vegan I said aha interesting so they started cutting out all fats all fat soluble vitamins vitamin D vitamin k2 and apparently that was connected to the strain the connected tissue around their teeth and the teeth fell out another person came in with serious liver pain and gallbladder problems right they went to the doc and said it was inflamed the doctor didn information to end up in my office and no one asked them what did you do just before you had these symptoms so I asked the question and found out they started some new diet it was Ideal Protein which are these powder foods which are low-carb but very processed high in soy protein isolates probably genetically modified very low fat and it it in with all these rashes in the body says when it is start got her to look find out what it was and started to put her on a food elimination program where we started limiting certain things and found out isolated it was a simple food allergy so you can use this with yourself or your friends it simple so I have a question for you so if you have a health problem right now take a look and tell us in the comment section what happened just before you started to experience that health complaint and let me know all right thanks for watching	Success
How to Stretch Tight Hamstrings Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHtXq_hkUTo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys in this video we show you how to fix tight hamstrings this technique can be used in any muscle in the body and it very very different nothing that you ever heard before but it effective not just on tight hamstrings but any tyght muscle but we demonstrate on type hamstrings and I going to show you first of all why it works and how it works and then we going to demonstrate it okay so first of all here we have the back part right here here which is the bottom part called the hamstring and that and what happens is that when the person goes down it won used to have really tight hamstrings and so if you stretch the hamstring if you stretch the tight muscle it has a rubber band effect where it stretching and it comes right back and it has to do with how the nerves are activated anytime you stretch a muscle there there called stretch receptors that counter the stretch and that make it more tight so stretching a tight muscle is not the best way to loosen a muscle what you want to do is stretch the opposite muscle on the top part of the leg and that is called the thigh muscle or the quadricep okay so by stretching the top muscle it sends nerve signals to the hamstring to tell it to relax and turn off and that has to do with any motion because if I right now this is activating and in order for this to move this has to send a signal to the opposite muscle to relax it and that coordinate because you have on off on off on off switches going on constantly coordination between the front muscle and the back and that provides Mo motion so anytime you contract a muscle or you massage a muscle the opposite muscle is going to be doing the uh opposite action relaxing so this is going to longate so if we want to make the tstrings longer and more relaxed we want to stretch the top muscles right here and neurologically the signals will come through the spinal column and relax your hamstring okay now it might sound kind of strange because I went kind of fast but I have my person right here that we going to have you stand right here now of course I necessarily have tight hamstrings but we can still improve on his stretching so I uh just kind of bring your feet a little bit outward yeah and go ahead and just touch your toes as far as you can okay so we touch his fingers to the floor right there so that going to bring them up and then we going to compare this and I take first of all that chair if you can give me that chair and you your your foot and stretch like this okay yeah perfect and we stretch this muscle the front part right here and as you kind of just like stretch it and kind of do this backwards a little bit so you feel tightness do you feel that okay good now do the other side and of course we quick demonstration but you could spend a a long time stretching the opposite muscle okay now we we your couch or your bed whatever now you here yes okay and now we stretch and kind of lean backwards and tell me where you feel this tightness do you feel the tightness right there right there yeah okay so just relax for a second let times one more time okay good now step off here and we okay come back over here okay so go ahead and uh bring your feet back a little bit now let far you can go down you can almost Palm it better yeah interesting eh so we didn stretch the opposite muscle you can do this for any muscle so that is how you can literally almost double your flexibility without over stretching the hamstrings okay so if you this technique um I have a download you can click below and I actually give you a you can download a PDF it on how to do this on all different muscles and I go through step by step of giving you ideas of how to do it for the upper back the shoulder whatever okay so I will see you on the on the next video	Success

The Top Symptoms of Magnesium Deficiency Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3DvyRrJDYE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	it magnesium did you realize that 57% of population is deficient in magnesium it enough leafy greens but magnesium is found a deficiency of magnesium is found in 80% of heart attacks so it important in the cardiovascular function because where calcium controls the contraction of the heart magnesium controls the relaxation of the heart okay and so magnesium clears out that calcium so then you can relax so you always need them in proper ratios so if you to get arrhythmias and that could be anything from a skip beat to an extra beat to an abnormal beat to a flutter to fibrillation atrial fibrillation to a palpitation where it hesitation all that electrical rhythm sort of speak the pacemaker problem would be magnesium and then we have hyper irritability I mean what about like hyperactive kids oh my gosh right here or hyperactive adults that just can cramps of the heart angina pain right here spasm of the arteries that coronary constriction this is great for it help you sleep at night because it tissue calcium so what happens magnesium helps lower the calcium buildup in the body so yes vitamin D and vitamin k2 will also help it but magnesium is another key mineral to help balance the excess calcium in your body so if you deficient magnesium you could have a tendency to have more Spurs you can have arthritis bursitis tendinitis calcium on the eye is cataract kidney stones golf stones tartar on the teeth calcium buildup on the nerve a little twitching called tetany that deficiency and then we have high blood pressure because magnesium is supposed to relax and calm things down people take it for constipation as well to help relax the muscles in your colon and if you have memory problems or learning disabilities or you learn as fast as you would like okay so that secondly what causes it okay what causes a magnesium deficiency mainly the diet because people don consume enough leafy greens it nuts it other foods it greens I get my magnesium not from a pill but from a food based concentrate I use the wheatgrass juice powder because if you look at chlorophyll chlorophyll is like the blood of the plant magnesium is the center element like our body you use blood with iron that magnesium is green and that plant uses as its chlorophyll and so I consume concentrated so wheatgrass juice powder 1tsp gives me all the magnesium I need and it it diet is an important thing stress depletes magnesium magnesium helps reduce cortisol magnesium reduces adrenaline yeah amazing vitamin D deficiencies so you need vitamin D not just to absorb calcium but to absorb magnesium yeah alcohol will deplete magnesium diuretics will deplete magnesium anti acids you need a strong stomach to absorb magnesium and all minerals by the way so if you have acid reflux that means you have not enough stomach and you take antacids anti anti anti acids you going to not be able to absorb those minerals so acid reflux really is not enough acid and so the valve doesn close and the acid shoots up and you get heartburn so that means you need to acidify the stomach so you can fix that valve and then absorb the minerals so really one of the clues for stomach acid is does the person have acid reflux yes okay then no wonder they absorbing the minerals magnesium especial so taking like tums and things like that or antacids okay so I hope you learned a little bit about magnesium and definitely apply this information and write your comments below	Success
Lose Arm Fat Fast: Tips from Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR8bmbiZFtY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys it create a video on how what to do to actually handle this skin problem here and here there are things you can do but there uh the first thing you need to know is that hormonally at age 38 things start shifting in the body now over a period of a few more years when you hit 50 now things really bottom out so during the menopause time period which is actually 52 but it can happen like 48 it could happen 56 hormonally the ovaries stop working okay so there backup organ is the adrenals on top of the kidney you have two of them and so you have this huge shift from ovarian hormones to adrenal hormones okay if there before menopause everything is magnified you get half lashes you have bone loss you have a lot of loose skin things like that but really this is a loss of collagen okay and that comes from a loss of certain hormones so I explain what hormones um all of these hormones decrease during menopause testosterone which is more lean body mass DHEA that that gives you all the other hormones and it you have estrogen that goes down and estrogen uh controls the fertility and the menstrual cycle and all that and then Pro progesterone progesterone also goes down that also involved involved in the second half of the menstrual cycle and they estrogen progesterone work together so um when one goes down they should be in certain ratios so when women are after menopause they considered estrogen dominant which is kind of weird because it what they mean is the relative ratio of estrogen to Progesterone is off so even though estrogen goes down a little bit progesterone really goes down low so that be create a situation when you estrogen dominant very similar to if you were to like take um I don sodium and um salt and pottassium they work together so if you have too much salt and not enough potassium you get fluid retention but if you have an what you can do is you can lower salt but you can also raise potassium and get rid of the fluid that way instead of just avoiding the salt so there there okay and these work together but the big one that really messes people up and that this growth hormone it growth hormone now in a in a child it mainly responsible for the growth of the child okay but when you become an adult it doesn controls other things fat burning tight muscles um energy collagen all the protein synthesis or creation of proteins hair nail skin muscle all that so growth hormone is the really the one that goes down as you age unfortunately so there are people that actually take growth hormone as a supplement it doesn you hormone a synthetic growth hormone that will work and that will actually help with your weight loss lean body mass and it slight minor side effects it expensive it weeks okay and then number two if you take it over a period of time your own glands shut down and you become dependent on it and then you have to take more and you get side effects like diabetes so there with taking hormones and that would only recommend taking it if as the last resort and you get people taking HRT hormone placement therapy bioidentical hormones which again if you take those you of confusion in the different organs so you you take you indirectly shut down the gland that so you basically put everything asleep same thing with the thyroid you take it over a period of time and then thyroid doesn so now when we have growth hormone that goes down this is the buffer this is the opposing hormone to cortisol cortisol is the stress hormone from the adrenal that very destructive on your protein so if that becomes in a what state or a cannibalism it breaks down proteins faster than it up so you get loss of muscle protein in your thighs and your butt yet you get loose skin here and here not a great sight saggy skin in your belly so really the loose skin is a combination of not enough growth hormone and too much cortisol but remember cortisol might test POS uh normal in your blood but the ratio is very very high cortisol low growth hormone so even though it oppose it there nothing to buffer it there it so it goes out there and destroys everything so that enough of this so in the next part I going to show you what to do about this situation so check this out all right now over here we have things to lower cortisol over here we want to raise growth hormone okay so let of go back and forth cortisol is triggered by stress so everything we going to do is going to reduce stress number one low intensive ex intensity exercise that would be like walking now over here you have to raise the high intensity because full body high-intensity exercise will increase growth hormone the problem is if you an adrenal body type you this yet so you walking for a period of time because just because you doesn an adrenal type you want to get out of that type and shift over here to be able to increase the growth hormone but we have to get you sleeping first to be able to handle this intensive exercise but ideally we want to work up to more intense exercise so you at first and then as you graduate slowly or gravitate into higher intensity you want to do high-intensity full body short workouts with lots of rest now the P90X is a great workout but I would extend that rest longer if you had an adrenal problem because the key is you could be overtraining especially if you and you to actually lose weight you your body a lady that did the boot camp and she was just her whole body turned to atrophy just skin hanging on her body and just no tone at all so that person you she maybe she work out once a week but the whole key is recovery okay so you can overdo it so we started with the low intensity exercise walking long walk every day just get in your space um not sitting in from a treadmill watching TV but getting out there okay so sleep will increase lower this and increase this so sleep is really important there of videos I have on sleep there nutrition you can take there techniques you can do but um that another video but the bottom line is we need to increase sleep I do not recommend um staying up past 12 the optimum time to go to sleep is about 10:30 maybe 11: but don before you go to sleep watch a comedy uh don mess up your sleep number number three support the gland again there techniques I have ACU pressure nutrition you can support the gland instead of the hormone that would be smart uh avoid stress mainly uh stressful people uh relationships that you um you know that always messes someone up I have a gal who particular individual and she can out of it she she has a situation because um he willing to change so it battle that messes everything up then you compound that with menopause not a pretty sight okay but we want to try do things to avoid stressful people and situations potassium foods important that salads um not bananas or sugar B vitamins nutritional yeast is the best B vitamins I would highly recommend that uh these two actually lower stress and then avoid sugar because that will raise this as well okay now over here intense exercise sleeping protein does trigger growth hormone but not a lot if you have too much it insulin which will inhibit this so we want just a little bit maybe 3 to 4 ounces each meal and uh but we need some Pro if you have the density of protein it difficult to stimulate growth hormone okay animal meat or animal products is the best for this but just just small amounts okay intermittent fasting now with this one it have to fast for days but you don you actually eat all these snacks between the meals that liver and that keeps the liver overworking all the time if you did three meals a day and no snacks that would be intermittent fasting okay that even if you did breakfast and then a good lunch and you didn after after that that would be intermittent fasting that will increase growth hormone but if you and grazing yeah why because the liver is where the growth hormone works through so that liver is the Hub and that connected to digestion so anything that is a strain on the digestion will slow the liver and slow this hormone so if you have constipation for example or bloatedness or a gallbladder problem it because growth hormone comes from the brain goes right through there and doesn one is the decreased cortisol fixing this and avoiding sugar again will also improve these so these are kind of the basic things that I look at if a person wants to tighten up their skin and lose weight I things I can we Implement that they already doing I that I can prove things are doing but make it better and these are kind of a good flowchart that you can use to tighten things up and you skin will start coming back and the collagen will start coming back one last thing and that has to do with digestion if your stomach is not strong enough as far as the acidity and the way you know that it indigestion bloating acid reflex gird that means you don watch my videos on that um then you can protein to be able to assimilate and pull it into your skin that could be a reason why you have loose skin too cuz you that something to acidify the stomach and really pull in that collagen into the cells to allow uh your skin nails uh hair uh collagen come back and a a really acidic stomach will allow you to absorb the minerals too especially the trace minerals and there I have that show about what Trace minerals do but trace minerals are basically minerals needed in small amounts that allow the protein to work better in your body and that would be one supplement that might be very helpful if you have also hair loss and brittle nails things like that so it not the big thing but it kind of assist in that area Okay so go ahead and try these things and uh comment below and I will see you in the next video	Success
How to Prevent Fatty Liver When You Lose Weight Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8dWWoADCFM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys it video I prevent a fatty liver when you try to lose weight on your diet okay I to use this little book to show you a reference a textbook on medical physiology this is the Bible of medical physiology this is very interesting I found this quote here and uh let me read this to you effect of insulin lack on causing a fatty liver strange as it may seem though insulin lack causes disillusion which is a breaking down of something of the fat stores in adapost tissue it causes a great increase in the amount of stored triglycerides in the liver leading to a very fatty liver wow what does that mean that means that when you lower your insulin and you start burning a lot of fat you risk of making your liver fatty because all that fat has to go through the body but there talk about so what happens you go on an eating plan and you okay if you watch some of my other videos on insulin we want to lower that thing down way down there so that avoiding the sugars we want to avoid um eating so many meals and grazing and snacking and all that so it causes this fat cell to dissolve and then the fat goes through your blood and ends up in the liver okay there going to do to prevent this from happening number one one you have to there keep the vegetables in your diet high and that least minimally every single day seven cups of vegetables because even the Atkin diet they don this high protein but then they don emphasize the vegetable and some other diets don they keep it low like Ideal Protein well what end up with a fatted liver because we need the vegetable to clean that liver to pose all the fats that that out of out of you so we want vegetable we don okay not just from a powder but actual salads and vegetables so you have to figure that out now you could drink your salad in a cal Shake if you want but we need the vegetable okay so that vinegar what apple cider vinegar is really really really good for the liver and the health dissolve a fatty liver and clean it up um there are other supplements that you can take like choline for example that also are good for uh fatty liver and that it or not guess what food has the highest choline egg yolks interesting right leathan is another thing you consume to dissolve the fatty liver and guess what I have has high leathan egg yolks so egg yolk is actually a really good thing to consume because what happen if you do that your body will then make less cholesterol because there your liver makes about 2,000 milligrams a day so if you eat a little bit more egg your body just makes less so egg yolks are totally okay so we want vegetable we want egg yolks and we definitely want appleid of vinegar two tablespoons and a glass of water three times a day okay so that important tip as you do your program to prevent a fatty liver and also how do you know if you have a fatty liver well if your belly is big you have a fatty liver okay but if you want to prevent a fatty liver go ahead and keep the vegetables in it all the time all right see you in the next video	Success
How to Increase Blood Oxygen Levels Using Nutrition Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MD1SOOlFw4c	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys Dr ber here in this short video we factors that affect oxygen and their nutritional factors okay in the body so what happens is we have this condition called acidosis that alkalosis it means your body is too acid so the pH is too low and we about in the blood normally the blood pH should be slightly alkaline and what happens is the pH goes slightly too low okay so we talking in just small little variations so when your body is too acid your breathing is going to be off you going to be like you frequently you Go Just Can hunger that all right so what do you do basically very simply you take calcium magnesium take it before bed take a little calcium magnesium boom cracks the pH um the way you get this condition is actually being in ketosis for a period of time now it to be in ketosis because you fat but ketones are acidic so you always have to offset it by eating more calcium magnesium what I do I consume so much vegetable that I don with a loss of calcium okay or I might do some cheese on a regular basis at night um but just realize if your breathing is off you need to uh alkalize your body with alkaline minerals vegetables or calcium magnesium would be the best thing all right another way to know that you need calcium is or magnesium is if you have cramps in your Cals okay so that secondly vitamin C deficiencies vitamin C is stored in your adrenal glands and vitamin C allows your body to hold oxygen in the body longer and better and so with the vitamin C deficiency you won your breath very long okay you will not be able to um you breath when you climb stairs fast your muscles will fatigue faster without vitamin C especially if you an incline like your legs are heavier um but mainly you can for a long period of time that adrenal problem but see the adrenal uh stores vitamin C so you just don enough vitamin C to store it so it drops out and you have oxygen problems mainly shows up incline walking upstairs out of breath you know that type of thing all right just make sure that when you take Vitamin C you always take it from a food concentrate don synthetic pill because the the type of vitamin C you are just ascorbic acid and that one little piece of the vitamin C complex you need the whole vitamin C complex so I like to get it from food base um a good source would be the weak grass juice powder that actually provides the full vitamin C complex then we get to vitamin E vitamin E deficiencies will create problems with high altitude breathing problems at the top of Every Mountain Top you will see empty bottles of vitamin E because mountain climbers consume a lot of vitamin E to help them climb higher and be able to survive at higher altitude so if you muscle tissue in your heart will demand so much more oxygen you cramping of the muscles in the heart and so like angina pain chest pain is really a vitamin E deficiency so vitamin E provides the oxygen to the muscle tissue if you muscle damage from an injury you need Vitamin E uh so vitamin E is really important in recovering muscle tissue and increasing oxygenation of the muscle itself and the heart all right uh where do you get vitamin E you get it from uh raw nuts you get it from the vegetables you get it from avocado okay that from a lot of um um you can get it from basically seeds nuts vegetables things like that all right so those are the three factors that you want to look at if you want to increase your oxygen carrying capacity and I will see you in the next video	Success

High Doses of Vitamin D Can Deplete Magnesium	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRjBPuj4q6I	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today I want to touch on a very important topic vitamin D you know how important vitamin D is for the immune system you know how important it is for keeping calcium in the bone you also know how important it is to decrease inflammation but it modulator so in other words it can control the immune system and a lot of people are taking a good amount of it every day and that however you need to be aware of this one fact okay if you do large amounts of vitamin D over a period of time without enough magnesium in your diet let your magnesium deficient because you don don higher doses of vitamin D intensifies magnesium deficiencies magnesium works with vitamin D they work together they share the same enzymes so as you increase vitamin D you could potentially decrease magnesium magnesium has a very very important function of keeping calcium from accumulating inside the cells inside the kidney and the arteries in the joints so it vitamin k2 and the vitamin k2 helps keep calcium from building up in the soft tissues the magnesium also does that as well so when you of d3 okay without the magnesium you could end up with potentially kidney stones or calcium buildup in the artery or calcium and joints where it should not be magnesium is really necessary also to activate vitamin D so they work together so if you amount of vegetables every day you have nothing to worry about or if you taking a good magnesium supplement you don just for the people that are not taking magnesium or not consuming vegetables and all of a sudden you end up with a health problem because you didn connect the dots and also vitamin v6 is very very important in this mechanism as well because it too is a cofactor and it helps these to work so if your diet is fairly healthy you don really have to worry about this but if you or you not somehow getting enough b6 that could be another problem as well b6 works together with these two nutrients I think the biggest danger is if you and you lot of my money because you have low back pain or something like that over a long period of time you could increase your risk of kidney stones I bringing this point up if you situation so you can actually supply your body with enough magnesium if you vegetables a day you have nothing to worry about that magnesium most of the magnesium is in leafy greens it the at the center of chlorophyll and that been watching my videos and applying my information which I of the time you have nothing to worry about and if you haven magnesium I put it right here check it out	Success
5 Potential Coronavirus Herbal Remedies	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5UPhiIl4dQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let remedies for the corona virus now the state is based on the research that was done in a previous corona virus there is some interesting data on this current virus Koba 19 which I down below and check it out but I think it simply because these herbs really are targeted to your lungs and the corona viruses tend to attack the lung out of all the tissues now a lot of this research was done in China using traditional Chinese herbs and it was taken from one of the oldest textbooks in China called the treatise on cold damaged disease written in 220 ad so I just gonna mention five of the herbs some of the herbs you can u.s. like Mei hung and there others so number one there called glycyrrhizin from black licorice which appears to be a very powerful inhibitor for SARS and related coronaviruses and the study that I got this data from which I put a link down below was actually in a very highly credible paper and Lancet and it revealed very positive outcomes on the respiratory system generating healthy mucus and there is also some interesting data on how it can hit the hepatitis C virus and even HIV but this phytonutrient in black licorice can increase the t-cells it has antiviral properties and it has the ability to decrease the penetration of that virus inside the cell in vitro which means tests that were done outside the body the next promising herb is the mayberry of leaf and then we get skullcap basal in which is one of the main chemicals in skullcap has shown to have anti Sowers kovin to benefits and i down below and it does it by inhibiting the receptor that that virus uses to enter this cell and just as a disclaimer I are going to cure any viruses at all this is primarily just for educational purposes so you can do your own research now if you haven to boost the immune system I put it right here check it out	Success
Hidden Cause of Depression and Anxiety Â Brain and Gut Connection Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcjDSmCw45o	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let underlying cause of depression and anxiety and it has to do with your microbiome the good bacteria in your gut now there brain and your colon through what called the vagus nerve it nerve in the body now what about the vagus nerve is that it two-way street but only 10% of the information is going from the brain to the colon whereas if we look at the communication coming from the colon to the brain that you brain from things that are happening in your gut especially with all the things that are connected to the good bacteria now what you need to know which is not really known is that your good bacteria make neurotransmitters they make a lot of neurotransmitters which are identical to the ones that your own body makes so here you have these microbes that really are symbiotic they body they other thing helping you greatly making a seto choline gaba norepinephrine serotonin and dopamine all of these neurotransmitters are gonna make you feel calm stress-free happy so if there making these that information is transmitted up here and you feel that great this part of the nervous system is part of what parasympathetic which opposes the sympathetic which is the flatter fight the parasympathetic is all about rest in digestion and recovery so if there stress down here it here and you anxiety panic and then depression all these things can occur if your guttin is not right and the reason I this up is because if you of this and you just sigh this to go the medical route and you just take drugs and not know that this is the room cause you might not ever solve the real problem now also with the microbiome they eat fiber okay from vegetables and they make as a by-product small chain fatty acids so these microbes are converting this fiber which is this carbohydrate to a type of fat and that specific type of fat can provide up to 90 percent of the energy for the colon cells it also helps improve insulin resistance which has to do with your blood triggers and it also supports the integrity of your gut lining so it has a very very important purpose so if you don microbes that are making this then guess what you gonna feel like you you the combination of a lack of these and lack of this could make you feel quite crummy also if there going down here or even if the microbes move to the small intestine and that called small intestinal bacterial overgrowth that can create a lot of stress up here as well because those microbes in the wrong place are hogging and eating up all your nutrients and leaving you deficient and creating a B vitamin deficiency and you stressed from that the point I wanted to make with this video is that there huge huge connection to your state of well-being and your digestion now on the flip side if you also affect your digestion you about the concept of being stressed and in getting an ulcer that thing to know is that this communication that goes down here also controls enzyme release acid production hormone release the muscles around the colon so you can have stomach pain from spasm the increase or decrease speed at which the colon works so you can have diarrhea or constipation you could have an over acid stomach and you can have a lack of enzymes which inhibit your ability to digest food so for more information about how to support a healthy colon check out this video right here	Success
Why Sperm Count Have Dropped by 60 Percent!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIsjyfPNLeQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hi guys today we sperm count is down trending 1973 to 2011 it crashed down by 60% okay now why is that it behind that because it to tell you exactly but there are several factors that definitely have a huge impact on lowering testosterone in reducing sperm count and sperm motility okay number one phthalates okay this comes from plastic using too many plastic containers water bottles also microwaving things and plastic containers are really really bad there so much plastic around us everywhere you go the foods in plastic that plastic is bio accumulative it can build up in the tissues it significant impact on lowering your sperm counts and your testosterone all right estrogen if a guy has too much estrogen that is going to lower testosterone and a sperm count now the fatter someone is the more estrogen they fat through the help of this enzyme turns testosterone into estrogen also the exposure to estrogen from chemicals and environment can mimic estrogen it called endocrine disruptors it the pesticides insecticides herbicides fungicides that recommended that you do Organic number three insulin resistance okay high levels of insulin which occur when you have instant resistance will lower your testosterone this probably is a really big cause right here with this one right here because this is been getting worse from the 70s to right here if you statins to lower your cholesterol that could be another reason why because testosterone is a sex hormone made from cholesterol so if you block your cholesterol production guess what you block the influence over your testicles alright number five GMO foods there huge connection between glyphosate which is the roundup-ready chemical and lowering sperm counts I put a study down below you can check it out this is why it vital to start doing organic foods and then soy soy since so many different foods soy protein isolates it keto friendly bars it shakes it especially if someone is a vegetarian or a vegan and they type meat soy has been directly associated with lowering sperm count I put some links down below now if you haven put it up right here check it out	Success
8 Recommendations for Autism	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLZTahnsheI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now in this video I about autism and what I personally would recommend to parents who have a child who developed autism now there are certain things that unfortunately I can reasons related to this topic so I going to keep this fairly basic but this is what I would recommend for a child who is suffering from autism first question is what is different about an autistic brain in a normal brain one big thing is this there toff adji etaf ajit is a condition where the cells are cleaning up old damaged proteins it there up damaged brain tissue or waste products in the brain or some by-product in the brain that shouldn can leave the brain overly excited and create a lot of cognitive problems there vitamin D in autistic children low folate which by the way low folate allows the cells to be damaged very easily because folate helps protect the DNA from being damaged so you having a lot of damage in the brain and a lot of free radical damage and oxidative stress you the myelin that around the nerves and brain neurons so we myelin and there related intestinal problem with these kids over 90% of the time they have big swollen bellies now there connection between the digestive system and the brain it nerve and the vagus nerve works like this the information going down to the gut from the brain there information coming from the gut to the brain is like 90% so the freeway brings a lot of information from the gut up to the brain so I really think there gut that needs to be restored which could be contributing to a lot of problems in the cognitive area now one thing that is known is that a lot of symptoms do occur after breastfeeding when the child is put on formula however a lot of kids get autism roughly about age four but sometimes they get it earlier now in these formulas they have a lot of things that children can be allergic to from soy from the protein in the milk like casein to all sorts of other chemicals not to mention the glucose and the sugar and all the other things they put in there so the first recommendation I want to say is try to breastfeed your child as long as possible okay I age 16 I years okay next thing is that you must read gluten from the diet you are probably already doing this but gluten just literally tears up the gut in these children and creates all sorts of inflammatory responses and that can actually greatly affect the brain chemistry next one rid casein it lot of times they put this in the formula you want to avoid gluten and encasing okay grains and milk products you may find a huge benefit just from that alone next thing you want to do some type of detox for heavy metals specifically mercury you can watch other videos on that but mainly I want to just talk about what remedy I would recommend is silica so look there natural remedy to kind of counter that selenium is also one as well in fact this is essential selenium will bind to a certain protein and act as a very powerful antioxidant and it will help to lower the effects the negative effects from heavy metals especially mercury zinc is essential for certain parts of the brain to function especially those one that are involved with autistic behavior the next thing is essential and if you don up on it putting your child on the healthy keto plan why because we know there use an alternative fuel I would definitely recommend also exogenous ketones and MCT oil for sure you can watch my videos on that but going on a keto plan a low carb diet will allow the brain finally to get fed so ketones can bypass the damaged part and feed the neurons directly glucose cannot do that so this is very very important and you probably see huge changes just from that alone now as far as fasting goes it very difficult to have a small child fast but at the very minimum maybe you just do three meals and no snacks that would be very beneficial because of the benefits of fasting on your brain are huge you can actually regrow new neurons when you fasting and maybe you just do two huge meals that are very nutrient dense and that might work as well you want to have this child consuming nutrient-dense foods it might be very difficult so you might have to do some type of powdered green drink because a lot of times they don vegetables but they need the folate okay also they need a vitamin D vitamin D is really important in the brain it essential for the immune system and there in the brain as well also a vitamin C is very important and I synthetic ascorbic acid I about the full vitamin C complex very very very important if you have not seen my other video on the brain and brain chemistry and what to do to support healthy brain I put it right here check it out	Success
How Coronavirus Targets Your Lungs Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spodpL6w4vo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we relationship between coronavirus and your lungs so the word Corona comes from a crown because the coronavirus has these little projections that look like a little crown and these little projections have affinity for lung tissue so in certain cases especially if you there getting a condition called ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome in this situation you have severe hypoxia that means you have a lack of oxygen other symptoms rapid breathing dizziness breathlessness sweating and here what bronchial tree you have these little air sacs called alveoli and they these little empty sacks okay that have a very thin wall and they butt up against these tiny capillaries so what happening is we have the oxygen coming in and it can very easily diffuse through this one cell layer wall on both sides goes into the red blood cells so now the red blood cells can be oxygenated and you can make hemoglobin and that body you also have the exchange of co2 that comes the other way so you can exhale the co2 out and breathe in the o2 so you have this exchange of oxygen but this virus having affinity for the lung tissue starts to create damage around the lining through here and on the capillaries on the other side there inflammation that develops there leak of plasma that starts coming into the lung through here so it starts to fill up with fluid try to breathe when you have fluid in your lungs it impossible what happens then is this wall starts to thicken and now we get less and less exchange of oxygen and co2 going back and forth and this is why supportive care is so critical these patients they have to give them oxygen and they have to try to minimize the inflammation that going on what omitted in this condition is two nutrients one vitamin D and one zinc this is a pretty well-known fact that ninety percent of patients with arts has a very low vitamin D level okay so what is vitamin D vitamin D is a an immune modulator it vitamin it improve your immune system it powerful anti-inflammatory so that would be a no-brainer if I had arts I would be downing the vitamin D immediately and then you have zinc zinc is probably one of the most important nutrients for your lungs especially to reduce inflammation if you longer you infections virus and bacteria you don have the full capacity of your army your white blood cells put a couple links down below to show you some very interesting research on two very inexpensive nutrients that honestly should be taken if someone has this condition if you have not seen my video on boosting your immune system I put it right here	Success

Coronavirus Destroys Sense of Smell: Why? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeBMiSGjpWE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I want to chat about something very interesting about the corona virus typically the symptoms and there actually quite a lot of different symptoms but mainly you get fever you tired a dry cough shortness of breath sore throat your lungs start to become inflamed and there recently there that there and it name for loss of smell is and Nos me up OK you can also get a loss of taste where everything just tastes like cardboard that has been recently found to be a common symptom of the corona virus so the question is why and I have some ideas the first thing I want to tell you is that there enzyme that perception of smell and taste and this is the name of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase 6 and this essential enzyme for taste and smell is zinc dependent ok and now I but one big symptom of a zinc deficiency is a loss of smell and a loss of taste you can even go online and order a zinc test which basically you take a little zinc and you put it in your mouth and if you cannot taste anything your zinc deficient because usually zinc tastes very metallic so if you actually taste that metallic taste you have enough zinc if you don so you can actually get that test and see for yourself but if you do research on this symptom alone ok a loss to smell it will list a series of causes and I going to go through them and I want to show you how many of them are related and connected to zinc because I really think the reason for this symptom is a zinc deficiency for a couple reasons one is that when you go through an infection especially in your lungs you use up a lot of zinc zinc is not stored that well so unless you consuming zinc chances are you to be deficient on top of that if you get this infection you more deficient and zinc has a huge purpose of protecting you against microbes and especially viruses it really key immune protector for the immune system so let the causes of loss of smell first of all we have upper respiratory infection we already know that 16 percent of pneumonia cases are actually caused by a zinc deficiency okay so there definitely that relationship nasal polyps next one idiopathic hypo gonadotropic hypogonadism now say that three times real fast basically the testicles are shrinking and idiopathic means we don okay unknown cause well guess what zinc deficiency will cause hypogonadism as well as low testosterone next one hypothyroidism antibiotics diabetes high levels of sugar in the blood will deplete zinc fYI Cushing syndrome this is a condition where you have high cortisol high cortisol and or stress will deplete zinc and then we have the next one cadmium poisoning cadmium cadmium is a toxic heavy metal that will definitely deplete zinc so that probably why you have a loss of smell because the cadmium depletes zinc and then you have this next one which I already told you a zinc deficiency so loss of smell could be caused by a zinc deficiency here is this this is a genetic condition where you have hypogonadism then we have this last one primary ciliary dyskinesia now what the heck is that and this just means the genetic disorder involving a function of your sperm well guess what sperm is highly influenced by the amount of zinc in your body so what can we learn from this information well the loss of smell potentially could be a zinc deficiency and if you take zinc not only will you be able to improve the sense of smell but you will also increase the strength of the immune system so what can someone take away from this information well just the importance of zinc and how vitally important it is not just for smell but to protect your immune system to decrease the duration where someone is going through an infection and the fact that when someone has an infection they you haven the immune system check it out I put it right here	Success

Why do Ears and Nose Grow as You Age?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6KFyBt9BNs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I as you age these earlobes start growing okay and your nose starts growing and your eyebrows start growing excessively you eyebrows long ears in the nose and of course the hair is out of the ear and the nose why is that what is happening is there something we can do about it or is it just inevitable we have to cope with it well the answer is yes it to look forward to but here your bones actually stop growing in the early 20s maybe a little bit before that okay but the cartilage will continue to grow a very very small amount as you age and the tip of your nose is all cartilage so are your ears and there also a bit of a lack of connective tissue so you don hold that cartilage together so things start to droop and sag all over the place but then you also have another thing going on for men primarily you have this spike in its ana called DHT DHT is a very powerful type of testosterone and there will start to convert testosterone to DHT and that will lead to hair loss male pattern baldness but at the same time you get an increase of hair growth in the eyebrows in the hairs in the ear and the hairs in your nose and even in the size of the prostate so that thing you have to look forward to just make sure that you trim them on a regular basis now there inhibitor it and it just so happens to be in pumpkin seeds and it things which I this enzyme will slow down the process of this GHG and that may result in some improvements in other parts of the body so anyway I wanted to clear up that little mystery and if you in knowing what will decrease DHT I put a link right here check it out	Success

Vitamin B12 Deficiency: The most common Cause Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uscfirFx894	Dr. Eric Berg DC	Hey guys, Dr. Burke here. In this video, I want to share with you the most common cause of a B12 deficiency. But let just talk about what B12 is. It essential B vitamin that you must get from your diet. And what it does is it makes these little things called nucleic acids, which which are the foundational genetic uh material for your cells. So basically they make the foundation of red blood cells, white blood cells and myelin. What is myelin? Myelin is the outer covering of your nervous system and it allows the connectivity of nerve impulses to travel. When you lose myelin you have all sorts of electrical problems, pain problems, nerve problems, pain, MS, all sorts of things. Um so that deficient in that. But you can also become fatigued, pale, memory problems, dementia, Alzheimer peripheral neuropathy with even with um like that anemia, okay, you know, there pernicious anemia. I into that what it is, but it from B12 deficiency. But most B12 deficiency does does not come from necessarily the diet. It comes from the stomach not being acid enough, low stomach acid. Okay? Because it takes a very strong acidic stomach to absorb B12 into the body. And a lot of people have a problem with the pH in their stomach. Normally a pH of the stomach should be between one and three, which is really, really acidic. Um, the way you know you have a low stomach acid is you have acid reflux, good gas, bloating. Um, because the stomach is needed to be able to close the valve, digest protein, absorb minerals like calcium, iron, all these different minerals. Onethird of everyone over the age of 65 has a B12 deficiency, but they all also have a low stomach acid problem. So, it solution to fix a big problem. So, what do we recommend? Apple cider vinegar. Okay. Apple cider vinegar pills or just go ahead and start drinking with your meals with some water, with a little straw. And that will create some really cool changes for a lot of people just by adding that one little thing in there. And you more B12. You can just go ahead and acidify the stomach and a lot of things clear up and you start to absorb B12. So, it Now, to build the stomach acid, you also need uh certain healthy salt like in sea salt because a lot of times when you low in sea salt, the acid goes down. Um, also, you need potassium comes from the vegetables. So, you need potassium to build the acid. Also, iodine. So, you do need these minerals as well. Um, so if you eating poorly or you enough minerals and eating healthy, you will lose the stomach acid and then you start having a problem with this. So, it go ahead and plug this in as far as to fix this and see how much better you feel. Write your comments below and I will see you in the next video.	Success

Coronavirus (COVID-19) Predictions Way Off - OKAY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3LNHQdA6Lo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	in this video we topic related to the Cova 19 predictions now a prediction is only as good as their Intel or intelligence or data if you have the wrong data your predictions are going to be way way off and unfortunately a lot of the media and a lot of officials are getting their information from certain sources this would be one source right here Koba act now you can look it up if you look at that site and their track record which I they the media will pick this up they put things out in the news you know cases are expected to quadruple there point of no return doomsday and then you find out it was actually not true so then you put a lot of people in fear for no reason and unfortunately the fear it doesn weakens your immune system let look at a couple things so in the website you have this interactive map you can click on a certain state and you can get their predictions on various things so let first this is what they said so the governor of Michigan used this data to put on a statement he said that the state would exceed 7 million Cobin 19 cases over 1 million hospitalizations and 460 thousand deaths if the state did nothing in fact today which is March 31st only a hundred and eighty four people died let by March 19th they predicted 400 hospitalizations when there was only 90 in New York by March 19th they predicted 5,400 hospitalizations and then you find out there was actually 750 hospitalizations by this date Tennessee by March 19th they predicted 190 hospitalizations when the actual number was only 19 in Georgia by March 23rd they predicted 800 hospitalizations when actually it was only 300 now the big problem is when you put out these predictions and the media picks it up it keeps people in the state of fear when reality the numbers are not as severe as they reading the news and listen to news take this under consideration pull the string find out the source of the information their track record so you can operate on the facts not opinions thanks for watching	Success

How to Fix Frequent Urination at Night (Nocturia) Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL-790zBpo0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys Dr Berg here in this video I want to share with you how to handle excess urination at night okay so let me give you a little background first there about one is diabetes and citus which is a type of Diabetes which blocks a certain hormone okay which caus you to dump all your fluids so this type of diabetes is a person that lot of cold water like ice water that just dumping tons of water they craving it and it so they okay that this condition right here because that condition blocks a hormone that is controlling the retention of urine or fluid in your body so there called anti-diuretic hormone that supposed to hold the water and this condition blocks that hormone so you dump all the fluid okay thus the relationship between diabetes and urination okay there called diabetes metis different situation that blood okay so high sugar in the blood what happens it spills over into the kidney and into your urine and wherever the sugar goes the water goes so water follows sugar okay so you pee more with this because you to have more sugar in the urine okay same thing with the if you not a diabetic whatever and you actually crave sugar and you eat sugar you hold a lot of fluid it so just realize that wherever the sugar goes the water will go too okay now there pre-diabetic States so I that this is just for diabetics there is a gradient scale from Hardcore diabetes all the way over here to a pre-diabetic situation so it happens one step at a time so many people have pre-diabetes and they don happens uh gradually over time so there resistance that and that that person is going to eventually turn into a diabetic so there well so they problem with fluids in general and I found that if you can correct that pre-diabetic situation you can greatly help someone night okay so even the derivation of the word diabetes uh comes from the word that describes urine passing out through a siphon or a tube so it word even comes from too much urination just coming out of your body which is interesting okay there are six things you need to do number one cut out the sugar so you have to start reading labels read the labels and if it has even one gram of sugar try to get it to zero grams of sugar or less than one gram that includes cutting out the fruits the juices the alcohol the hidden sugars in the grains like the breads pasta cereal crackers you need to cut that out okay why because that the problem with insulin okay so just start cutting it out all right so then number two no snacking between meals why because even if they does increase insulin what we want to do is we want to lower the insulin okay cuz people with pre-diabetic have a resting insulin of five to seven times greater than a normal person okay no snacking so so if you and you number four which is more fat so you want to add more fat with the meal fat is the only thing that will not trigger insulin too much so it kind of keeps insulin down so you can have breed cheese uh you can have peanut butter avocado olives coconut oil o some type of fatty healthy fatty thing that will actually allow you to go longer because if you try to do this on a low fat diet you going to be so hungry you need a snack okay less meals so if you skip the meal and just do two meals one at 12 and one at s uh 6 6 o and then you just add more fat to adjust that all right next one five more potassium foods that would be more large vegetables okay we want big salads you can eat the meat with the salad you can have a shake with Blended like a kale Shake if you want I have videos on that but we need more potassium why because potassium decreases the need for insulin all right and then lastly more B vitamins B vitamins also decrease the need for insulin so actually these two are really important don synthetic version get some nonfortified nutritional yeast from the heal store okay or amazon.com make sure it nonfortified take a tablespoon of nutritional yeast it very important to do this so number one cut out the sugar no snacks between meals less meals like two meals maybe three but no snacks in between more fat with the meal more potassium foods vegetables avocados more B vitamins okay from nutritional yeast if you did if the average diabetic or pre-diabetic the did these things right here you would see huge huge changes these are the most important things and you just need to try this for like two weeks and prove it to yourself that it you urinating just think about what your sleep is going to be like okay and your energy is going to be like getting up every hour and the hour is a is a nightmare and I will guarantee that um the people that have urination problems at night that I I mean I much I can I can guarantee that you going to see a one- one relationship they have a blood sugar issue they always doing something they eating a little bit too much sugar doing too much alcohol snacking grazing at night have any too many meals the meals are too big sometimes they fat they vegetables okay so I hope that helped and I will see you in the next video	Success
Top Zinc Deficiency Symptoms Â MUST WATCH! Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XFcwkmBcK0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys Dr Burke here in this video we deficiency now what is zinc zinc is a trace mineral it that but it deficient you different issues number one your sense of smell will go away your sense of taste will not be there you won actually be as hungry those are some common symptoms white spots on the nails you got these little uh spots in the nail but but usually what happened is that you ate a lot of carbohydrate that depleted the zinc because too much sugar or carbohydrate will pull zinc out of your body so if you had a little white Speck on the middle of your nail and by the way the nail grows every six months we know about three months ago you had a birthday party and you ate the whole cake right so that determining that okay now we have acne skin issues eczema all these skin issues dermatitis could be related to zinc but there issues too that almost mimic a zinc deficiency like a vitamin A deficiency or a vitamin B2 or B6 deficiency so really you have to look at all of these things to see what it is but I will say that if you absorb or utilize vitamin A so they always work to together with like minerals work with vitamins together and zinc is kind of like a a main uh mineral that enzymes so it body reactions okay so with proteins and that with hair alopecia which is like little spots of hair growth that thinning hair that could be a B vitamin deficiency like biotin but it can also be a zinc deficiency as well they work together okay then we have rhinoviruses well zinc being a trace mineral helps put uh viruses back in remission now the thing about virus is you can virus because it piece of genetic material that in a sack that can activate your own energy from your cells and create a Cascade of an immune response so zinc is one that rhinovirus in check and actually it can if you take zinc when you get sick it can speed up the time of overcoming the sickness and actually can prevent that issue as well but rhinovirus is like the one that you have the postnasal drip the sinus congestion the sore throat the sneezing um so you need more um zinc all right then we have lower testosterone both in male and female if you have low testosterone your libido will be very low okay that can come from a zinc deficiency um and then mouth ulcers again that can come from other things but that little um sore on the inside of the mouth which is usually virus related the viruses like herpes come outter emission if you stress and because the zinc becomes deficient so sugar and stress will deplete the zinc reserves okay because more cortisol pumps out and then it needs zinc to to use the for the immune system and then basically you deplete your zinc reserves so it different enzymes um now it that has a lot of zinc um from the sea of course and then we it like beef it it foods but it Foods right here and also zinc actually helps make the red white blood cell so the adrenal gland uh controls the white blood cell it suppresses the immune system and that involved in that whole process so we have a relationship between countering stress having the trace minerals to make sure that your immune system is strong okay so here just and lastly I want to talk about um in other countries like not in America but third world countries a lot of children and infants will die because of a zinc deficiency because they have diarrhea and so you know zinc is Unfortunately they don in the soils so it could be a factor of it it trying to get your zinc from grains but not if there zinc and other minerals called phytic acid in Grain so that chemical in the grain naturally prevents the absorption of minerals okay and then also your if your stomach acid is not strong enough you so if you have heartburn you have gird indigestion chances are you deficient just from that alone okay so there zinc I wanted to cover uh some of them but there helped and I will see you in the next video	Success
Is Your Butt Turning Into Your Belly at MENOPAUSE? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbvsc0cU6AY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	Hey guys, Dr. Bur here. I have a question off my website. Someone wants to know um why during menopause is she losing her butt and her bell is getting bigger. Okay. So, I what that adrenal chapter. Okay. All right. So, this is in chapter five. And here happens during menopause. The adrenal glands have to back up the ovary. In fact, they take over. They make the same hormones as the ovaries. So, when the ovaries go in retirement, the adrenals have to then take over. If the adrenals are stressed out, okay, what happens is you adrenal hormones that you normally shouldn adrenal hormones during menopause literally destroys proteins. Now, what it protein from two main muscle groups. One is the glutamus maximus, and that behind, your butt, and it quadricep. That it your butt and your thighs. Okay? It converting it to sugar which then is converted to fat primarily around the middle section. Okay. Now you probably have seen this in women after menopause they get this huge trunk this midsection with two little stick legs when before menopause they had a nice little curve and now they lost their butt. The butt has turned into the belly and that has to do with the adrenal hormone. Okay. So, what happens if your adrenal glands get bad is your your butt turns into your belly. Okay, that that thin. They look like they lean, but they They flabby sometimes as well. Okay, so what what you need to do is not necessarily eat a lot of protein. That to work. What you have to do is fix the adrenal. It it lot of different things from changing the diet, taking the right nutrition, doing the right exercise, sleeping, all those things which I discuss in the book. Uh it So I just want to answer that question and kind of guide you on if you have that problem where you need to start doing your research and focus is on the adrenal. Okay, I video.	Success

Best Remedies for Asthma Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXSA3TEzkag	Dr. Eric Berg DC	Hey guys, Dr. Burke here. In this video, we best remedies. The absolute best remedy for the asthma is this one right here, vitamin D3. Why? Because vitamin D3 works on the immune system. Most asthmatics are always deficient in vitamin D3. Okay? But if you there need to take it with K2 because vitamin K2 and D3 work together. I created a link down there to kind of watch that video. But because if you take too much D3, you calcium and not enough K2 that drives the calcium into the bone. The calcium might plug up like the joints and get arthritis, bcitis, tenonitis, that type of thing. So for every 10,000 IUs, you need 100 micrograms of D K2. I the data down there so you can check it out. So this one is uh 10,000 IUs. So the next point about vitamin D is you need it in higher amounts if you have asthma. So probably between 20,000 IUs to 40,000 IUs. But don about the amounts because IU really like 10,000 IUs is like one milligram. It not that much. Okay? So you taking too much. So I wouldn about it. In fact, if you sun, you get about 40,000 IUs if you there for like a half an hour. So it not that much. So vitamin D3 is for asthma. Okay. Now secondly is what is the common drug that people take for asthma? They take bronco steroid inhalers. What is a steroid inhaler? It cortisol. So cortisol is part of the adrenal gland which is you have two top of the kidney. And when you run out of those hormones you get asthma, right? Why? because those adrenal hormones are relaxers for the bronchial tubes. They get rid of inflammation and uh if you deficient in the adrenal even adrenaline that everything will tighten up. Okay. So, um what I recommend for that is cortisol support. This is awesome. Now, this is not going to cure asthma, but it gives you some support. Why? Because it supports the adrenal gland itself, both the outside and the inside of the gland. So, it has a real complete full food vitamin C complex, adrenal hormone complex. So, it gives you everything you need. And this would be a great thing to if you the help of your doctor off steroids or be able to take less uh that would be a good thing to take. This is not uh supposed to be used with people with high cortisol. It burnt out and don So, you might want to try it. So the other thing with kids uh the kids that get lots of sun what about their asthma is it seems to go in remission. So if you have the chance to get sun get more sun and that will help you with the asthma. Okay. So the last thing about asthma is this. There are some other nutritional elements uh or deficiencies that could trigger asthma and that has to do with a lacking of your stomach acids in your stomach. So if you stomach acid, you could also experience asthma. So drinking apple cider vinegar to put the stomach or I back in your body would be very beneficial for asthma. So I would take a teaspoon maybe in some water three times a day and just see if that doesn you. All right, hope that helped. I see you in the next video.	Success
Sleepy After Eating? Â Top Reasons Explained by Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052YbMQhgTs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys in this video I going to talk about sleepy after eating do you get sleepy after you eat sometimes people think that normal to be tired after you eat okay it usually comes from two different reasons number one when you eat you trigger insulin BEC and that makes that means the blood sugars are going to go high it meal everyone wants to take a nap because there you your body and E sugar and especially combining like something like some soda some sugar with the Protein that deadly combination or even some pasta dish you are going to get tired because the blood sugar effect so what you need to do is change your Foods cut out the refined sugars cut out the breads pasta cereal crackers biscuits waffles pancakes and just have like a salad with some protein not too much just enough just a little bit maybe the the deck of a card like 3 to 6 ounces and then um what you can do is um consume a little bit of fat as well okay why because if we eat a little fat we can actually allow us to go longer and without eating it be more satisfied so we keep insulin low okay now number two it could be that you food just kind of sits there and you feel bloated in that case we need to acidify your stomach a lot of times that just kind of perk you right up so you can either do apple cider vinegar in water and drink that with the meal or you can do it in pills Outsider vinegar plus that has a couple other things in there take that before you you eat and boom the food digests and you won tired anymore okay so it could be those combinations so how do you know what you need well if you cut out the sugar and eat healthy and you we know you can to add the acidifiers okay plus if the food sits there doesn bloated that means we need to actually support the digestion not necessarily the blood sugars okay so hope that helped go ahead and apply that put your comments below your success stories	Success

Do You Have a Manganese Deficiency? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rux4_1gYdE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys I want to talk to you about a very interesting mineral called manganese okay so what is manganese well meanes is a trace mineral needed in small amounts you need in 2.5 milligrams a day um but here actually builds muscle it makes your bones really really hard it also supports and strengthens your ligaments it supports the thyroid okay so those are the functions if you deficient in manganese if your mother is deficient when she you could get flat feet because it does affects affect the structure of the bone formation collagen and so if you deficient you can get stiff hearing loss and there that are associated but these are the main ones right here what will cause a maganese deficiency would be malabsorption some problem your D digestive system it could be that your stomach is too alkaline it could be because you have you acids in order to absorb all minerals you need a very very strong acid stomach to pull these minerals into your body so that could be why it is also you come from taking too many of the too much iron too much magnesium and too much calcium because those minerals do compete for some of these other ones and so too much of those will not let you absorb you know this one right here and the other thing is you could pretty much get all you need if you consume leafy greens nuts and seeds egg yolks that largest amount of manganese in cloves I don cloves but maybe you can crush them up or something but but if you big uh salads you get enough maganese but if you and you have digestive problems you could explain why you all right thanks for watching and I see you in the next video hey guys thank you so much for watching I really appreciate it please click the share button below and I will see you in the next video	Success
Salt Water Gargle	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBF9GPjHv6A	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I had this question from someone that wanted to know if I gargle with salt water will that kill the corona virus well let all I want to say that there studies that I found that demonstrate gargling with salt water will actually kill this virus okay however that being said there is some research that shows that gargling with salt water could potentially prevent certain viruses from going down into the lung however before we get into that I do want to mention that there is some other research that shows that this corona virus can replicate in your throat before moving into the lungs so they found a high rate of replication and viral shedding during the first week viral shedding has to do with this so when the virus goes in the cell and it starts to reproduce and then it decides to leave your cell and go in somewhere else whether it goes outside your body or in another organ that called viral shredding and just the fact that you with water it would appear that you would dilute the concentration of viruses if there gonna put all the studies that I found below down in the description but this one was interesting because it was talking about the anti viral innate immune response using salt to support a certain chemical in your immune cells that potentially could kill the virus because if we just take salt sodium chloride okay now there are certain enzymes in the inner skin barrier inside your body that can convert chloride into hypochlorous acid now this acid is the main ingredient in bleach that is very antimicrobial it viruses and guess what certain immune cells like the phagocytes that eat up the virus and bacteria and fungus and dead cells in your body they actually will pull in viruses and bacteria and expose those microbes to this acid so they make and use bleach hydrogen peroxide they even make a certain type of antibiotic and they release enzymes to kill off these microbes so let me just read this one little paragraph that says this mechanism is dependent on the conversion of available chloride ions okay that hypochlorous acid mediated by peroxidase that is the enzyme that will convert this to this since hypochlorous acid is the active ingredient in bleach which has a broad of antiviral range against DNA comma RNA comma enveloped and non-enveloped viruses the antiviral mechanism should work against different types of viruses so basically you system the raw material to make its weapon which one of the weapons is bleach which is very toxic to us as well as microbes now I want to mention some of the studies involving using salt water so the first one involved one hundred and thirty people they gargle with just water and that was efficient in preventing upper respiratory tract infections and healthy people next one was a Japanese study on 20,000 children they found no outbreaks of influenza or fever infections during the process of this study now in 2010 they found washing your throat with salt water could be considered the most effective measure for upper respiratory infection in 2013 they did a study with 338 people using salt water and they found people were less likely to get a upper respiratory tract infection so this is how you do it it a very inexpensive take a half a teaspoon of sea salt okay I would recommend the Himalayan sea salt but I think any salt will do and if you don have sea salt you can even use regular salt and you dissolve it in eight ounces of warm water and you gargle with that a few times a day so in summary I think it good thing to do can potentially it could help you thanks for watching	Success

How to Stop Tinnitus (Ringing in the Ears) Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYrixP8w9y0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	Hey guys, Dr. Burke here. I want to share with you what to do if you have tonitis. It people. It have this constant sound in their ears and it can really drive them crazy. But tonitis comes from two main root causes. It specifically viral to the inner ear, which then later on life can come out um as kind of like a mucus buildup. So, there are natural antihistamines that you can take, and these are three of the ones that I like. Um, if you could, and I don you want to search on Amazon, you can find them. Uh, find a high uh quality bioflavonoid. Okay, that vitamin C complex. Um, so bioflavonoids are really good to uh help the the immune system get rid of mucus. garlic. Oh my gosh, that best things for the inner ear. And you could even um put a little drop in the ear, but I suggest consuming it. Uh garlic is really good. And oregano oil. And I like these in the pearls, not as a a fluid that you drink, but in little pearls, so you can swallow them. And these three combinations will be really good if your problem is maybe an old infection that you have this mucus and these tiny little hairs that are in the ear that are supposedly supposed to be free of mucus. If that is the the real reason why you can in the ear, then these remedies will be the best thing for you. Okay? If it not infection, then it won it Okay? Now, if this doesn go to plan B. It could be a soft tissue calcium that whistling effect. Soft tissue calcium can build up in the inner ear. And that really comes from a vitamin K2 deficiency. And the combination of consuming K2 and D3 together are a really good uh remedy to pull this excess calcium out of the soft tissue of the body. So, what I recommend is get the MK7 version. That version versus the MK4. And then get 100 micrograms uh in each pill and then get the D3 and the 10,000 international units, okay? Together. And I would personally I would take four and four of these in the morning. Okay? And within probably one to potentially two weeks, you should notice a difference if this is the real cause. So, because it uh to find uh to detect what it. You know, you go to doctors, they don remedy. There drugs. But this is a great way to try something natural and see if it can help you. And also, I have a quiz down below. If you want to find out more about what link below, take the quiz, fill it out, and we for watching.	Success

Insulin Resistance, Potassium & Blood Pressure Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFmjLloYN7A	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys Dr burck here in this video we resistance potassium and blood pressure out of all the nutrients that you need potassium is something needed in very large quantities you need 4700 milligrams of potassium every single day now what does that mean with food it means that hardly anyone is getting their potassium because you would need seven to 10 cups of vegetables every single day okay so how many cups of vegetables do you consume in a given day maybe five maybe less but I I I do it because I I feel so much different but here much potassium as we do sodium okay most people consume four times as much sodium as they do potassium they have a lot of fluid retention so they both work together in relationship to fluids and hydration but we need in if you look at vegetable content it the potassium and very low on the sodium okay but if you salty things that going to throw this whole thing off so what happens when you have low potassium is you get high blood pressure potassium is a physiological relaxer it calms the nervous system it actually softens the arteries it actually can prevent Strokes it and uh so it can also prevent constipation it also can prevent leg cramps so it it conductivity and muscle contraction and relaxation so with a problem with potassium you can have a lot of cramps tightness and tension in your body and you can also have a lot of um electrical problems with your heart arhythmia atrial fib that deficiency because people don enough so let have high blood pressure and you have to take a diuretic thide well what that does is it gets rid of fluid fluid well it does it also gets rid of potassium so what happens when you take this diuretic to fix your high blood pressure you lose more potassium raising the blood pressure more so now you need another medication and then you more water which dilutes the electrolytes more especially potassium and your blood pressure goes higher because more water is not going to hydrate you it electrolytes that you have potassium specifically and you don hydration you once had so the whole myth of drinking more water to hydrate you is not quite true you need the minerals specifically potassium that you need in the most amount like even magnesium you need about 420 milligrams but potassium need 4700 okay now um also if you sensitive okay especially through blood pressure what that really means is your potassium deficient the way way to fix people that are salt sensitive is just increase potassium and they so instead of restricting salt why don we just increase potassium it strategy because you need potassium for other things uh 98% of all the potassium in your body is inside the cell not outside the cell so when you get test tested from your blood or whatever testing you do it test a potassium deficiency because it all inside the cell and so um you might you might think you have normal levels but you really don because you never did intercellular test for potassium okay the other interesting thing about potassium is it takes insulin to control and absorb pottassium if you don can insulin regulates pottassium now how does that relate to a pre-diabetic someone has insulin resistance or a diabetic well if they have insulin resistance they cells are going to block insulin so guess what potassium they enough potassium so a lot of times when you have a pre-diabetic or like even a diabetic State they have a huge huge deficiency of potassium and one of the things I make sure that they do is greatly increase the vegetable content to increase the potassium to help uh balance this thing out because there have so many side effects from that so if you actually add more potassium you can decrease the need for insulin so that wanted to touch on the relationship between these two uh these three items right here and if you have blood pressure start increasing your vegetables and if you like this kind of information if you like learning about nutrition if if you find it interesting I have a health coaching training program that you might be interested in learning about where we teach you a lot more about nutrition and how the body works so if you want to apply to the scholarship that I have click the link below check it out study it and maybe you can be a health coach as well thanks for watching	Success
Symptoms and Causes of Vitamin D Deficiency Explained by Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG57mNSDM1M	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys dr. Burke here in this video we deficiency okay now vitamin D is mainly there to help you absorb calcium in the small intestine the vitamin D helps absorb calcium by 20 times that if you didn going to absorb calcium that much so it brings it from the intestine up into the blood okay it also helps lower blood pressure so some people that are deficient have high blood pressure because of low vitamin D it also affects the immune system so if you have an immune deficiencies or autoimmune problems vitamin D can actually help that in fact some of the microbes in certain diseases are very stealth and they block the receptor for vitamin D to cause you now to pull that thing in there to perpetuate the illness it asthma so if you have if you asthmatic and you go out in the Sun and you get all the Sun you will actually reduce your symptoms greatly so vitamin D deficiencies can set you up for as asthma symptoms if you in D like 2,000 milligrams is not going to or 2,000 international units isn going to do anything you need minimally ten thousand international units now if you notice I milligrams international units are units that are a lot different rating systems so you need a lot more to equal milligrams so I I probably like if you you thousand international units of vitamin D so I mean the Sun will give you that so you want to be you don about taking too much vitamin D I mean you could take like a hundred thousand and still be okay but the danger is not counteracting with vitamin k2 I put some links down below if you don vitamin k2 to get more data but vitamin k2 works with vitamin d3 and together to transport calcium through the body so what happens vitamin k2 will take that calcium from the blood and push it into the bone so it actually helps it works with the vitamin D in the transportation of calcium so you don tissue calcium or calcification the arteries get the mk7 version that natural and then without vitamin d you get bone pain okay and then also vitamin D is really good to prevent depression so those especially that winter people kind of get the blues so let vitamin D deficiencies number one gall bladder if you don then you to emulsify and pull in the fat Seibel vitamin vitamin D or even k2 so that could be a problem and if you don a gall bladder gall bladder problems then you need to take something some bio extract to help you and then cortisol so in this book frank neder encyclopedia of endocrinology volume 4 talks about cortisol counteracting vitamin D so that vitamin D so here you are getting the Sun taking the vitamins but it still shows low could be cortisol could be high levels of cortisol that that can block it and that cases have a lot of issues with calcium because they have a vitamin D deficiency so it also could be like it winter you don be a cause in which case you want to take some extra virgin cod liver oil which is the best source of vitamin D and then it could be from your diet you don D so anyway I just wanted to create a little video to give you a little summary of vitamin D and tell you some of the other connections that you might not be aware of so thanks for watching	Success
Understanding Restless Legs Syndrome and Causes Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAoq14NlDQc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hi guys Dr Burke here in this video we syndrome I had this condition in my 20s it drove me crazy I would get up in the middle of night and pound my legs I to go run around the block to try to get this energy out little did I know it actually very easy to fix there Prim primary causes to this number one there acidosis that you may have and that is just the buildup of lactic acid that deprives the muscle of oxygen and there quivering and a shaking and a feeling of electricity in your legs and other muscles as well so you if this is the case you just simply need Vitamin B1 but I like to get it from nutritional yeast because most of the B1 that you buy is synthetic the synthetic will still work but you don long term just maybe short term but this is a B1 deficiency um and it works like within a day okay so this is the more likely cause and this is an electrolyte imbalance with a potass iium deficiency okay now you need a lot of potassium every day you need like 4700 Mig one banana is 300 milligram you need 4700 now how many times does 300 go into 4700 a lot was it 14 15 times so bananas aren you three reasons one is you consuming enough vegetable okay if you did you get the potassium number two maybe your stomach is not strong enough as far as the acid if you acid medication well then you don the correct pH to hold that potassium because what causes acid reflux is uh a lack of acid so you want to take apple cided vinegar or an acid or ban hydrochloride to be able to absorb and get rid of the acid reflex so you can absorb minerals in general so that just a side note of a lot of people that have this problem they don it okay so we have lack of dietary potassium number two we have the stomach acid enough number three you have a blood sugar issue could be hypoglycemia could be insulin resistance it could be diabetes all three conditions um you have a state where the insulin is not working and it potassium absorption so if you don facility to even absorb pot in the cell you can get restless leg syndrome so I put a link down below just to if you have blood sugar issues you crave sweets or you tired after you eat or you feel bloated after you eat or you satisfied after you eat or you crave whatever carbs then you need to watch that video okay so you can fix that but taking potassium will correct this so you want to increase the vegetable but as an immediate thing you can do is go to the healthfood store or go to Amazon and order some potassium now the problem most people do is when they order this they don only order this to 99 milligrams so you need 4700 milligrams so you don to have like 100 like a lot of pills every single day right that to be workable so get the powder get uh pottassium citrate okay and then what you can do is dissolve it and do like um maybe 700 milligrams in some Solution that mean and then do another 700 like maybe a couple hours later another 700 so spread it out slowly through the day do this for two days watch your legs it just like feel so much better okay and then post your comments below so I hope that helped um but it unnecessary condition you don take drugs and thank you so much for watching	Success

What is the Hypothalamus and its Function? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQxwwL0yFKQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys I want to share with you some data about the hypothalamus it a mysterious gland it it of an almond okay and then the pituitary is the size of a pea so they very small but let hypothalamus like what is the hypothalamus hypo meaning below thalamus so there called the thalamus it the size of an almond it important gland because it about 11 to 12 it small little bundles of nerves that are called nuclei and these little centers are pre-programmed kind of controls like blueprints that tell the body to do certain things so the hypothalamus has a goal of adapting the body to the environment to help it survive so it feedback from the body and it adjusting different things like for example it controls sweating blood pressure it controls stress reaction it controls leptin which has to do with your fat being burned and also your safety and your metabolism the GI controls thirst certain emotions like a rage that can affect that female sex hormones sanity tranquility pleasure centers are up here water balance fluid electrolytes hydration there called the super Chaya snick nuclei and that Center can control like a little clock that tells you when you go to sleep when to wake up so it control off that and then the thermostat so if it this little Center will cause the body to do that stress sex so if you ever notice that you for your true stress your sex drive might go down because they the same Center fluid wakefulness heartbeat temperature so there of different like life basic functions that are up in the brain that basically constantly are controlling the body okay so that basically keeps certain things at a constant so it brings things down to a level it basically the ability to adapt to your environment to maintain a certain constancy just like if you have blood sugar you have to have a normal ninety to a hundred or temperature 98.6 so that kind of what sleeping at seven hours so basically you go to sleep when it gets tired and you wake up when it gets light right well that mini computer chips and then we have down here communication on the pituitary the pituitary is like the relay switch like the middleman it of the football team so you have the owner the coach and the players players are the organs down here in the gland so you have this whole hierarchy of of different things so you have the owner that sends the you know what to do and the coach actually gives the information out to the players and same thing like an organization you have the CEO or the manager that would be a better example because the manager is going to like relay what the goals of the CEO are for the company and make sure it gets done so down here the messages are integrated and coordinated to the different organs likely at the liver you have the adrenal stress gland the gonads that would be testicles and ovary and then the thyroid pancreas a couple two glands a couple of the organs so you have these messages that are sent down here and then once the messages are given to adrenal for example then the Drina has to perform that function so when it does it then it sends another signal back up letting the pituitary know okay we did it so that feedback loop connects and then the message can turn off so they have this entire communication system that down here all the way back here up here all day long and it really really fast so the endocrine system as a whole is the superior communication system that travels through the blood that that go through the blood the endocrine system is composed of glands that make hormones or messages and the communication lines that happen through the blood but what about the hypothalamus is that its half gland and half nerve nervous system so there are nerve connections to that attached this hypothalamus to the pituitary so it it anyway just so you know there things I could mess this whole system up number one your environment if you live under a constant stress state that will destroy this whole system over time you you body that will destroy this if you have certain types of surgery surgically you can have something removed like a taking the thyroid out it puts stress somewhere else menopause let you no longer using your ovaries well that adrenal so you have all these things that can happen and then of course you have the chemicals and they endocrine disruptors those are any chemical and environment including pesticides insecticides herbicides fungicides that can interfere and act like hormones mainly estrogen and you seeing it now with the growth hormones I basically has an estrogenic effect and on your body so it way too much estrogen and that up the glands creating cancer and and whatnot and then sometimes when you have like a major stress in your body you can actually have so much return communication that you can grow a tumor on your pituitary so there things that can happen along the way but that just kind of gives you summary exactly what the hypothalamus is okay so I hope you enjoy that and also I have a quiz down below in the description box go ahead and take that and that will help you find out your underlying cause thanks for watching	Success

or your police force that goes in there that protects you so if you want to protect yourself against infection and other types of uh lowered immune system you really need to understand more about this system because there some unique things about it um so it specialized type of white blood cell and um when you have an infection or an injury um the majority of the white blood cell is the nutr so let talk about what it is it of fagos it cell that eats things up so it consumes bacteria and uh if you ever see a little video of it you just kind of goes around and just like Pacman just eats it right up and that would be probably the best analogy it your Pacman of your body so it also releases very powerful enzymes to break down proteins because these bacteria are made out of protein so releases proteases that cans and other things that are involved in the immune process um that actually help destroy so you can look at it like um the neutri fils have Claymore amines they have M16 they have light an anti-tank Weaponry they have shotguns they have all this Weaponry to do with these microbes and so so that that bad news we involved in infection and injury and the interesting thing about it is that if there is refined carbohydrates in the diet if there is sugar in the diet fru especially what will happen is these neutrophils will go after that sugar and leave the infection alone okay so they kind of are inactivator neutralized with sugar or glucose so I people do a lot of sugar their their sinuses get congested or they might have more mucus buildup and a lot of times people get sick after they eat sugar as well and that it neutri neutr um the other thing is there below and I below the motion of grief apparently suppresses the neutr so there when people go through losses or grief it really suppresses this white blood cell making the person very susceptible to infection and autoimmune so I mean I 27 years almost every single autoimmune case occurred after some type of loss a loss of a loved one divorce you know when they were grieving because you really set your immune system up for opening the door for all sorts of the microbes and viruses kind of invading the body um also nutrifil and high amounts are found in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis it joint of rheumatoidarthritis patients so what does that mean it means that these things can go Rogue and they lose their ability to differentiate between a microb and your own tissue and that arthritis is an autoimmune case so you have these your own immune system attacking itself so you have a lot of neutrophils going on in that in that situation so um vitamin C is the remedy for most people so vitamin C happens to be a real good antihist natural antihistamine uh it thing to speed up the activation of nutrifil the nutrifil even have receptors for vitamin C and when there an infection or an injury they dump up to a 100 times not 100% 100 times more vitamin C into the Cascade into the infection that they normally would leaving the blood actually a lot of times when you check the blood an infection it goes way down with vitamin C that white blood cells are pulling it and it it immune reaction so what does that mean it means that if you um you these infections that well and that probably why the adrenal glands have a huge stor storage of vitamin C ready for this reaction to infections um the other thing is cortisol in general cortisol is the adrenal hormone they basically treat autoimmune cases with cortisol because Soul tends to suppress the white blood cell but not necessarily the neutr it actually will increase the nutrifil which is very interesting so they don why it does that but um I think the reason why is it has a a temporary boost of immune uh support um if it temporary but then what happens over a long period of time when cortisol decreases or the person burns out when they have low cortisol like in a condition called pisin their immune system is very very fragile and weak they autoimmune type situations so what happens is low cortisol puts the person at risk too so we need cortisol in the right amounts so it just goes to show you that if you out on sugar nutritionally deprived of vitamin C you have more affections and more arthritis and more inflammation um now now uh as far as Vitamin C goes yes there are synthetic ver versions of vitamin C and there some natural versions now if you going to take Vitamin C um and I opposed to you taking a short-term synthetic version if it calcium absorbate which is a buffered uh Scorpia vitamin C as long as you take it with bioflavonoids because you need the whole complex because if you take straight scorc acid or even one portion of vitamin C out of the complex you can end up being deficient and the other factors so make sure it comes with a with a complex the Rootin the B flavonoids and as many additional things as possible um lemons limes are awesome it of that um so that do number two is to avoid the sugar but the other thing too is you can uh get these these lymphocytes to work faster by acidifying them through the outside of vinegar there studies that show that when you acidify the body uh the fyes go to work and they clean up the infections a lot faster um there try to find it if I find it I link down below it using Hydrochloric acid they used to dilute people I with diluted hydrochloric acid uh back in I think the 40s and they could they found they can actually get rid of an infection really really fast so that was hydrochloric acid but you can use other acids too like outset of vegar and actually drink it in a glass of water with a straw but that will help as well but the nutrifil is your primary uh defense mechanism uh I think it to understand what to do and to protect yourself by supporting these guys and uh just want to give you a little insights on what you can do if you actually find that you run down these are some actions that you need to think about all right thanks for watching	Success
The Deeper Cause of an Eye Stye, Boil or Abscess Â Eye Infection Stye Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKl1j0ZCsLE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I want to talk about sty okay a sty is a a fluid-filled pus little sack on the inside of the eyelid that irritating uh they lot of times people don what to do with them okay and this could also relate to boils you have underneath your armpit your back the back of the knee it common causes it sometimes viral okay but what happens is that your immune system the white blood cell the most common white blood cell is the neutrophil and that primary defense against these infections so the neutrophil goes in there and it like a little Pacman it starts eating up all the bacteria the problem is is if you have consumed too much sugar okay or you pre-diabetic you have hypoglycemic insulin resistance whatever what happen the nutrifil will nearly always go after the sugar and ignore the infection okay that because and the they just love sugar okay so they stop working so sugar inactivates that whole thing so you might find that the worst thing to do when you get one of these things is take some Cy like like medicine like with glucose or drink juice or eat eat or drink anything sweet is not a good idea so what you need to do is cut out all sugars of all kind that includes the breads pasta cereal crackers biscuits waffles pancakes and try not to snack too much you want to keep the sugar way way down and you going to get over these things a lot faster if you do that okay so go ahead and try this and leave your comments below	Success
Intestinal Obstruction & Vitamin Deficiencies Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_TZbz16C-U	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys in this video I want to talk about leaky gut IBS Crohn deficiency what happens is that a lot of people get damage in their intestines from antibiotics from viruses from certain microbes and the little tiny hairs or CIA or roots in your intestine become damaged to the point where you don like in a little plant that has the roots your intestines are the roots just like a plant that absorb the nutrients so one of the biggest things that doesn bile b i l e that that helps dissolve grease and pull it pulls in fat salable vitamins so if you released and it doesn the small intestine but low later down in the chain of intestines because you have like 33 feet of intestine so let say it finally gets absorbed way down there that can uh be the wrong place to be absorbed and it can create a problem like an ex excessive laxative in that you have diarrhea bloating cramping because the bile can even act as a toxic thing um and uh normally you would absorb reabsorb about 95% of all your bile okay and it goes right back to the liver through the lymphatics and then it recycles well with these conditions you will be losing all your bile so there going to be a point where where you have too much bile and then you don have any at all so you can fluctuate between constipation and diarrhea all the time so um there that um you need to know about not having bile number one that start having vitamin deficiencies so all the vitamin deficiencies of vitamin A would be vision problems at night um skin problems sinus issues all the inner skin like your immune system uh you going to have those despite consuming vitamin A Products because you don have the vile because the intestine is damaged this is just a this is a big common cause of a lot of vitamin deficiencies and then you have vitamin E that hormones it sudden you have all the this dry skin and you wondering where that came from uh then you have vitamin D vitamin D helps the absorption of calcium and magnesium by 20% in the small intestine well if it your intestine is damaged you going to pull in that vitamin D so right there there goes the immune system there goes the calcium there goes the minerals you can can issues so um one of the remedies for the for these conditions is high amounts of vitamin D if you can absorb them uh then you have K1 and K2 those are involved with clotting and K2 is involved with the mobilization of calcium out of the artery so again if you can those you can have a lot of problems with the blood pressure heart problems arthritis btis things like that okay so that deficiency despite you eating them so here to heal the intestinal wall so you going to have to avoid um a couple things of course you avoid the most obvious thing which is gluten okay you have to avoid in fact avoid all grains if you have Mickey IBS or chromes and you that is a huge problem for you so I mean if we just eliminate grains and even including gluten or not um probably a lot of your problems will clear right up Dairy if you have these issues you going to have allergies to Dairy so just cut the dairy out you can you can are the no-brainer of course also what comes with that with the breads the pasta Cal crackers biscuits all that and the sugar so if we eliminate that that good but there bone broth is a really good healer because it glutamine which is actually heals the lining of the intestine you can take also a good probiotic Sometimes some of these probiotics are too strong and they can create a war and more of a detox so you might want to start off slowly um I like a microb called effective microbes and I can get it on Amazon or another website but effective microbes are a nice blend of a lot of different microbes that all work synergistically cabbage is one of the uh vegetables that are it and it do cabbage juice that healer of the intestines uh cabbage uh is good for heartburn you can take it in many different forms you can cook it steam it you can eat it raw but you may have a problem with it raw so you might have to steam it and that includes avoiding too many foods with too many fibers too because fiber could IR irritate and overwhelm the microbes so this whole thing with you even doing a kale Shake Blended could be a problem you might not be able to do that because you don able to pull it off pickle juice seems to be a real safe thing good for the intestines uh anything with lactic acid like Kombucha Tea would be good outside of vinegar would be good for some people ghee is a clarified butter that good if it CYO vitamins especially if vitamin A because what we don don vitam vitamins because since you deficient in these nutrients you going to have to consume them in larger amounts for something to go in there I mean we those nutrients so we have to put them in somehow uh so then and green juices that will provide chlorophyll to help heal the inner skin uh the wheat grass juice is the best because it has a um a certain hormonal growth factor in there that and all the inside of our intestines are basically kind of a skin it skin so that would be really good to clean and heal the intestines okay so anyway so that if you have these conditions uh it could be why you nutrients all right thank you so much for

Can Trace Minerals Inactivate Viruses? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRYGJvD3mkw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hi guys Dr Burg here in this video we going to talk about viruses in relationship to trace minerals now trace minerals are those minerals that are not needed in large amounts like for example manganese pottassium even calcium is needed in large amounts but selenium zinc copper is needed in smaller amounts usually below 100 milligrams and so trace minerals uh have many different purposes but they the formation of proteins and they also involved in the formation of enzymes in the body okay but Trace these trace minerals are really good to deactivate the viruses and put them back on remission stop the reproduction of viruses so selenium is is really important selenium is also good for the liver it the active form of thyroid hormone so if there mineral that you you need to take zinc uh is kind of a common mineral that a lot of people already know will help their cold but it deactivating Rhino viruses which are the viruses in the sinuses that keep the person this is really good also for a sore throat so it then we have copper now copper is interesting copper actually is part of the vitamin C complex uh copper is necessary also for a collagen formation if you get a sway back or that your lower lower back curve becomes exaggerated it goes into too much if the if at Birth you are your your mother is defici copper you can get that that is involved in the formation of proteins ligaments and tendons and collagen as well so but it um for certain type of viruses then we have manganese okay it magnesium uh and this is also another Trace mineral that will help put the virus in remission and also as a side note uh if a female is carrying this baby and she the child could end up with flat feet so there arches and manganese okay so these trace minerals are really important in a lot of different other aspects as well now calcium is not a trace mineral but it just a regular mineral it needs you need it in larger amounts but I want to just bring it in here because I have been very successful in if a child has a fever and it doesn viruses don give the child calcium okay calcium citrate calcium magnesi magnesium I found that you can knock out a fever if it okay so it that virus back in remission so now the question is um how do you become defici in a trac all right good question well number one our soils our soils are depleted the farmers don minerals back into the soil so if the if the soil doesn the plant your food will not have the trace mineral in it either uh gastric bypass if you procedure then you problem with your absorption of trace minerals and that leads us to the next one low stomach acids this is probably a very common issue as you get older you lose your stomach acids stomach acid is necessary in the absorption of trace minerals if you do or regular minerals too even iron and calcium so if you low in stomach acids then you going to pull these trace minerals in so that could be the root cause of it so now the question is how do we know if we the common symptoms would be gas indigestion bloating okay even heartburn uh the food sits there too long those are all signs of low stomach acid in which case you would want to take something called Bane hydrochloride or apple cider vinegar okay and I want to show you this is a my Trace mineral that I have and what unique about this Trace mineral blend it it the prehistoric dinosaur age they have they found that the the vegetation in the layer of that Earth was all just really great absorbable trace minerals that are very different than sea minerals or salt minerals or metallic minerals so these are 15,000 times smaller than regular minerals so it 100% absorption you put it in some water you don it starts to fortify any type of missing element that you your body um now it energy it provide what so you might see really good improvements in your nails your skin your hair but it can also build up reserve of trace minerals as well all right thanks for watching	Success
Get Rid of Puffy Eyes for Good with Dr. Berg's Proven Techniques	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGtiylOAtM0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys dr. Burke here in this video we puffy eyes in those bags and Neath the eyes okay now I know the cucumber slices don work long-term or creams and everything this is all an internal problem it mainly a kidney problem now I can see people across the street and look at their eyes and they like oh that anytime you have a kidney issue you gonna have a liver issue so they almost similar in problems you can have a really sick kidney and a healthy liver okay because they both work together but the kidney is a detoxifier it basically takes all your blood it filter it filters the blood so here with a kidney number one you can speak consuming excess cooked protein too much protein so let dinner and you huge huge plate of chicken wings or chicken fingers and you have absolutely no vegetables nothing to counter that you going to eventually turn into uric acid crystals and a lot of excessive waste because your body can than a certain amount of protein so anything extra your it strains the kidneys and the liver okay so a protein can mess it up in large amounts how much protein do you need three to six ounces that you don excessive protein and too little vegetable people that have the bags have the kidney problems usually don eat vegetables okay they don to start doing that if you have this problem because this also relates to the potassium levels in the body you have so much potassium and so much sodium they work together and fluid retention usually as a sodium excess well if you just have your normal potassium amounts that alone will flush out the sodium and get rid of the fluid so we need four times as much potassium to sodium so a lot of people have it reversed they doing four times as much sodium to potassium and they and you can see it in the ankles there pitting edema but this situation it vegetable has the most of the potassium and then you of potassium from proteins so then we have alcohol right so alcohol messes with your kidney it messes with your liver it crates the bags a lot of people think that to drink alcohol on a regular basis they drink a bottle of wine two bottles of wine and you think well that here if you can probably addicted okay so then we have the MSG monosodium glutamate - oh no glutamate is a flavor enhancer it they hide it not as much monosodium glutamate they hide it as modified food starch and what it that away and just drink fluid and you just like gonna fill up with fluid really fast so it it insulin too and then we have just straight sugar and junk food that going to mess with your kidneys so we need 4700 milligrams of potassium that would be seven to ten cups of vegetables a lot of times people say well I don want to have much potassium because I heard that it might damage the kidneys let me let me just give you the truth in the kidney unless you dialysis unless you bad kidney where you kidney failure everything else you can do potassium the fact it potassium protects the kidney it doesn worsen the kidney you need potassium to protect the kidney it the kidney is so damaged you can starts to increase because you getting rid of it so you need so much potassium but your body gets rid of that much potassium every day - so if the kidneys can with a lot of potassium which is dangerous to the heart but again for those of you there aren okay you can the potassium but the cool thing is we the supplement we it from vegetables so you more safe with that then you have another cause of kidney problems which would be the prostate enlargement what happened is the prostate when it enlarges it actually pushes up into the bladder okay it pushed up in the bladder and it restricts the amount of urine the bladder can hold and then the urine backs up through these two little pipes are called the ureter s the kidney and then what happens the kidneys can backs up and the kidneys start getting larger and larger so that kidney - is having a prostate enlargement I had one guy and all we did is some simple acupressure you can actually work on these points with a massage tool you can work on them and it have it probably really tight and painful and congested you do it lightly and you keep working it out I many people do that and all of a sudden just dump all this excess fluids from their bodies it that kidney and then number two we have blood sugars so usually when someone hypoglycemic insulin resistance or a diabetic they usually a puffiness underneath the eyes just because wherever the sugar goes that the water goes so they have a lot of water retention in pockets and the ankles and the hands in the eyes I mean underneath the eyes so what you want to do with if you have blood sugar issues you want to do 3 to 6 ounces of protein with each meal don it out completely because you need some 7 cups of vegetables that do right you probably need more but that and help the blood sugars and help insulin regulate itself and then we need a little healthy fat to allow you to go from one meal to the next so we snacking so that links down below if this is your first video and you how to and correct blood Sugar that would be one cause this far as the kidneys the kidneys do well on a lot of vegetables a little bit of protein and just so happens one of the things that are good for the kidney is the kidney bean what a coincidence it shaped like a kidney all right so apply this information all right guys so thank you so much for watching I next video	Success
Thymus, the Missing Link in Viral Protection	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hynF5ZLEluc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys I am back today we talk about the thymus gland in relationship to viruses it link let me explain what is the thymus it thyroid is located in the front part of the neck it regulates your metabolism and many other things the thymus is a little lower it on top of the heart right underneath your sternum right here okay and when you then when you get older it actually shrinks okay so the thymus is a lymph gland it going to talk about what it does and what you can do to keep it really strong the thymus has a very important primary function and that is something called central tolerance what does that mean central tolerance tolerance is all about preventing a self attack like in an autoimmune disease where your body is attacking itself you have certain mechanisms in place that prevent that self attack your body is supposed to differentiate between your own cell and a pathogen because we don immune system to go rogue and destroy our own tissues and this is a very interesting point because in certain experiments when they removed the thymus gland all sorts of autoimmune diseases popped up okay and autoimmune disease is very specific to a gland so if you have an autoimmune condition to your thyroid you have any buddies that are attacking itself so the thymus has a very big importance in preventing this from occurring let a t-cell and by the way in the thymus you have T cells and B cells the T stands for thymus because it actually develops in the thyroid gland whereas B cells develop in the bone marrow so there going to try to keep this very very very simple you have the killer T cells which basically kill viral infected cells so in other words if that virus gets into that cell this killer t-cell will destroy the entire cell and the virus and by the way in order for this cell to develop it needs iodine so if you iodine what can happen is you might not have the full capacity of the killer cells the killer like your special forces okay now we have the helper t-cell the helper t-cell works by coordinating the army it doesn but it does tag viruses so it will take spray paint and put a big X on the viruses or the pathogens that need to be taken care of and those messages are sent to the killer T cells and other cells for them to do the dirty work the helper T cells are the coordinator they army they do a lot of recruitment so they will signal certain parts of the immune system and tell them to ramp up and get ready and send more troops because we need more help then you have something called the regulatory t-cells and this is very very interesting this cell keep the immune system from overreacting so here you are you have this war going on between your new system and this pathogen and you have a lot of things flying around you have inflammatory things you have certain toxic chemicals that your army has to be able to kill off pathogens well some of that leaks out and it actually irritate your tissue you have certain what called cytokines that are like weapons that your white blood cells use to kill viruses and bacteria and fungus and parasites and when you get sick and you get a headache or the full like symptoms or muscle ache or fatigue what you feeling are those cytokines or weapons from your white blood cell doing the destruction same thing with a fever your body is just trying to kill off something the worst thing you can do is quickly try to suppress that with some medication you want to let your body do its thing you don fever too fast and you want to kind of cope with some of these symptoms as long as you can because your body is working it infection and realize also that the regulatory t-cells need vitamin D because if this cell is deficient vitamin D it cannot do its job so this is where you get an overreaction of inflammation and you could potentially get a situation where you have a cytokine storm okay now I don you connection to the lung and how some people are developing what cytokine storm and that in intensive care in serious condition where they respirator and they have this serious inflammatory reaction well guess what that is because this system where this cell is broken down and it can down or suppress the reaction of your immune system trying to kill off this thing so when you look at this cytokine storm where you have this inflammatory process it is overreacting it immune system is loss its function to suppress or balance out the other side and it just so happens vitamin D can help this cell and it can also help suppress inflammation as well and by the way I think I already mentioned this but the helper t-cell also needs vitamin D to help coordinate the army so you can see all of these cells work together and by the way this cell right here also has a job of preventing auto antibodies or autoimmune conditions and so when you lose this function you get autoimmune issues you have allergies you have all sorts of inflammatory conditions and as a side note vitamin D is one of the best anti-inflammatories it modulator so it actually suppresses an overreaction of the immune system all right now we get to it b-cells okay b-cells basically make and two bodies now what are antibodies you have five different categories of antibodies antibodies don anything per se what they do is they tag things okay I know tannic pathogens viruses and fungus and parasites so these other cells can do the dirty work and kill them so the weakness of antibodies is that they can see what once the virus gets in the cell they can you have like cells like this that can tag the cell and so this cell can destroy the whole thing so here thing antibodies are very very specific to certain pathogens in other words you may have an antibody to epstein-barr virus for example very very specific you may have an antibody to another pathogen in fact what capacity of how many antibodies your body can actually develop it can go up into the numbers so high and I about a million trillion antibodies your body has the capacity of making that many so you can see the power of your immune system you can have resistance or protection to pretty much anything now some antibodies can also bind with the virus okay and just kind of leave it out to dry but they don it with any type of poisons like this cell right here releases certain I was called cytokines that actually can poison or kill viruses alright so that kind of gives you a summary of what the thymus does realize that it about vitamin D it well with the finest because if you deficient in zinc you get a trophy of your thymus gland it shrinks and so you functions so what important to support the thymus is zinc vitamin D iodine keeping your stress low and of course avoiding sugar if you haven healthy immune system check it out I put it right here	Success
What is Leptin? Explained By Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-K9xpu1pzo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys I there leptin is they think they maybe could take into supplement it them this way let you the basics of what it is leptin is a hormone okay that your body that tissues or glands in this case is produced by a fat cell that sends a signal to the blood telling the body to do certain things so leptin is this say a T hormone it is stop eating unsatisfied okay so let me ask you a question are you hungry right now do you get cravings do you feel like you it could be because your leptin is too low so let means so your fat cells make leptin okay the more fat you have the higher level of leptin you should have okay so if someone lot of leptin and not be hungry but that this hormone is that they have so much left in being pushed out and pumped out from the fat cell which is abnormal that the receptors that receive that leptin start resisting left in so it similar to insulin resistance in that you have high levels of hormone communication that go into the receptor and the Septor protects itself by downgrading so in a case with insulin resistance you have certain parts of value that we have high insulin and other parts we have very low insulin same thing with left him so very overweight people have a situation where they have a lot of leptin but it unavailable to their body and that means they most the time so here they have this huge fat fat supply storage system but they they that oh yeah it just you know have willpower well hormone only this is going to really force you to eat because your hormones are completely out of whack it easy as saying I anymore so the point is that the whole theory of low willpower causing weight gain is is not true especially when you get into leptin it the body so people feel like I don know if this ever happened to you where you feel like you have to reward yourself as food right well that of this whole leptin thing it it center of the brain which actually has pleasure and it that give you pleasure and the whole thing but here have to do you have to follow the the rules on insulin in that you want to keep your insulin low and I put a link down below if you watched my videos on how to do that because that fat because the solution to this is to get rid of your fat to make it easier to heal the leptin to the point where your leptin resistance can go away and you can have normal leptin so your cravings will go away I think the best thing to eat to satisfy you in the meantime would be actual fat at the meal so I to put a link down below most of you watching have already seen those videos but if you haven below to how to heal the system to actually get rid of cravings but you know Lipton is kind of a secondary hormone and that done any videos on it it you can trigger with taking a food and the supplements that people take it joke they don the time first of all I don that there supplement that you buy at the / the amazon.com and I also even if it was a hormone it be digested by the stomach unless it was injected through the protein so that the real solution is to just understand what it does and then focus on reducing insulin get the fat off this will heal the cravings will get better as well thanks for watching hey guys thank you so much for watching please click the subscribe button and I will see you in the next video	Success
How Age Influences Your Immune System	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgDSa8F4CYU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let immune system when you age as you age your risk factor goes up dramatically for viral and bacterial infections and the reason why is that the microbiome changes that is a term to describe collectively all the microbes living in your body they great majority of your immune system and they do a lot of other things too like make vitamins but I want to focus on the immune factor as you age the microbes age as well you get less diversity you have more pathogenic bacteria so we get this ratio of more pathogens and less friendly bacteria and that makes you more susceptible to getting infections also if you don microbes you quantity of butyrate and butyrate is involved in helping someone with insulin resistance and their blood sugars also it has a connection into supporting a healthy immune system on the flip side a baby who getting a tremendous amount of good bacteria in that breast milk not to mention immune factors anti microbials colostrum which is building his or her immune system it as you age to maintain your gut flora and even take a very high quality probiotic now the second thing to know is that babies and children have a huge thymus gland the thymus gland is not the thyroid the thyroid is in the front part of the neck the thymus is a little bit lower right underneath your sternum right on top of the heart the thymus is the key lymph gland having to do with the training camp for your white blood cells they of your immune cells if a major infection happens your body will recruit a lot of those T cells T standing for finest to be able to pull those into the battle to fight off the microbe now the problem is when you get older your thymus shrinks down to nothing so you really lose that ability to make not just the T cells but the b cells too and b cells make the antibody so the less antibodies you have for different things the less defense you have against certain microbes it really important to take enough zinc to support the thyroid because if your zinc deficient which a lot of people are you will also have atrophy of the thymus gland I think would be very beneficial as you age to not only make sure you taking enough zinc and also to take a thymus extract and you can get that as a supplement I don you research but I think that would be a really good thing to support if someone is getting older and more fragile and they wanted to boost the immune system also as a person ages they taking more medications the one that really destroys the microbiome is the antibiotic and you probably already know that but also the PPI is the antacids and the medications that do with acid reflux GERD indigestion heartburn things like that metformin interferes with your gut bacteria that type 2 also SSRIs that for anxiety or depression as big negative impact on your microbiome laxatives and corticosteroids like prednisone really affects the microbiome so the less of this you have the less immune system that you have and lastly as you age you have a much more difficult time absorbing vitamin D so vitamin D is one of the most important what controls an overactive immune system and I I asthma allergies and especially autoimmune problems as well as the condition called the cytokine storm which is a flurry of immune reactions that can occur in your lung and that can actually kill you so vitamin D is a really good call me action on a hyper reactive immune system and one of the problems when you get an infection from a virus for example is that that virus has the sneaky little strategy of blocking the receptors inside the cell for vitamin D and knocking out your ability to use it you take a lot more vitamin D to counter that effect because the receptors for vitamin D called the vitamin D receptor is downgraded with certain viruses and certain bacterial infections as well there to support as you get older the microbiome your friendly bacteria and the thymus gland thanks for watching and if you want to know how to boost the immune system check out this video right here	Success
The \"Alkalize Your Body and Fight Disease\" MYTH! Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hL20rKw8FME	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys Dr Berg here in this video I want to talk about the alkaline cancer protection myth the one that goes that you need to alkalize your body to prevent cancer okay it those things that everyone knows but it really doesn to explain why first the first question I always ask people is what part of the body are you talking about that you need to alkalize is it the stomach is it the large bow is it the saliva is it the urine is it the blood every single part of your body has a different pH are they saying that you need to alkalize the entire body are we need to bring it beyond the normal uh level the pH that it should be so people really can grow in an alkaline medium now it is true that tumors do grow faster in an acid environment but tumors and cancer make acid cancer is not caused by an acidic environment it causing the acidic environment does that make sense so you see the differentiation there there really there that if you alkalize the body you going to reduce the risk of cancer that there alkaline foods in fact it alkalinity that from vegetables it basically cruciferous vegetables which are highly alkaline uh inhibit what called angiogenesis which is which is the development of new blood vessels to tumors and cancer if you shut off their blood supply they won just so happens those vegetables have the power to inhibit the new formation of blood vessels to that new entity and also all the fital nutrients in the vegetables are very anti-cancer but it has nothing to do with the alkalinity okay does that make sense all right well thank you so much for watching hey guys thank you so much for watching please click the Subscribe button and I will see you in the next video	Success

Zinc Effects on Your Respiratory System	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th5eRWK-LVQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let your respiratory system zinc is so connected to the immune system especially your lungs that I thought I just do one video dedicated to that one topic if you duration of lung infection is increased next one if you you there are three main types of t-cells and this stands for thymus these are immune cells you have the killer T cells which specialized in killing viruses you have the helper T cells which are the coordinating unit very very important in all aspects of your immune system they recruit the backup army they increase the killing power of phagocytes they are a real essential and key coordinator for the entire immune system and they level of zinc in the body and then you have another T cell called a regulatory t-cell and what this cell does is it suppresses the overreaction of the immune system it also prevents autoimmune diseases and if this cell is weak you asthma allergies and even excessive inflammation that seems to linger and it goes into a chronic phase your T cells really really need zinc next point is that if your zinc deficient you a lot more cytokines cytokines have many different functions one being messengers another one is pro-inflammatory so it can cause inflammation that of the immune process but sometimes it gets out of hand so if you in zinc you can potentially even go into a cytokine storm where you have this serious inflammatory condition of the lung and that can lead to scar tissue was ink deficiency could be a contributing factor to this right here by the way zinc is a great anti-inflammatory in general and if you getting lung infections do go up when you have conditions like COPD chronic destructive pulmonary disease your nearly always deficient in zinc your risk goes up for ARDS a distance for acute respiratory distress syndrome also you respiratory tract infections as well as lower respiratory tract infections now this next one is very interesting low levels of zinc can make the lungs more susceptible to ventilator induced injury now when you get an event to later which is a breathing machine your risk of mortality goes up the chances of you surviving are less what this does is it puts a lot of pressure into the lungs and oxygen and if the lungs are already weakened this could create some additional damage which you don oh zinc can actually help protect the lungs against this damage to a certain degree and that study I will put down below and it Prime induced injury fascinating if you have a lung infection if you is going to be using so much zinc chances are you just the fact that you have an infection causes a depletion of zinc and then you lose more ability to fight the infection all right so the next question is what foods do you eat to get zinc and what are the things that can prevent you from absorbing zinc for that you need to check this video out right here	Success
Iron Deficiency Â Functions, Symptoms, & Causes Explained By Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD3bW2z-yNw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys dr. Burke here in this video we deficiencies okay iron is the most common deficiency so let break it down to make it really basic iron is needed for oxygen transport through the blood okay it also is involved in producing energy at the cellular level it actually helps make DNA it helps with hemoglobin myoglobin which is basically the transport oxygen system to the blood and also to the muscle so iron is needed to transport oxygen to the different parts of the body and then neural globin which is basically similar to these other oxygen transports but it goes to the central nervous system like the brain spinal cord and that type of thing but iron also helps make T cell so it in the immune system so the symptoms of iron deficiency are fatigue kind of washed out and if a woman actually is a like has really heavy menstrual cycles they can be anemic and they have low iron and they tired chronically fatigued increase heart rate rapid breathing especially when you go up inclines low endurance you run at a gas real fast restless leg syndrome is an iron deficiency it could be other things but iron is one of the causes attention deficit disorder like attention content of problems with concentration associate kids and adults poor memory involved with low iron interesting it so normally we need about eight milligrams of iron per day postmenopausal women need 18 grams of iron that the average person a pregnant woman needs 27 milligrams of iron every single day yes iron is in spinach it vegetables it the challenge is that the animal sources of iron are much more absorbed by the body that you can still get it if you vegetarian for sure if you actually have a variety of vegetables but it easier to get it from like meats and chicken and fish in that type of now other nutrients needed to absorb iron you need vitamin A so when you have people are deficient in iron they at the same time copper zinc so you need these other minerals and by the way when you of times they use something called ferrous oxide which is I don that source it the body and you want to get it from food it actually taking iron as a supplement and you take at the same time as you take calcium chances are you absorb it so you want to take your iron and take your calcium later about two hours later don you conversions from t4 to t3 so the thyroid needs iron for its conversions so one of the causes of an iron deficiency is yes maybe you doing it correctly and you just maybe too many refined grains that could be a cause of your iron deficiency if you a digestive issue or a low stomach acid you iron that well or if you have a gastric bypass we have chronic inflammation you is interesting too there called phytic acid and that is something naturally in legumes grains nuts and seeds and if you foods and they going to actually block the absorption of iron and other minerals so here catch-22 if you consume those those foods you need to germinate them which basically means soak them in water overnight dry them out and then consume them now there are certain conditions genetic conditions that have too much iron in the liver because the liver is the organ that stores mostly iron and it can become very very toxic so what I recommend in that situation to remove the ions is to consume legumes grains seeds and nuts that are not germinated so you can you know try to limit this toxic iron and maybe take more calcium as well alright so that basic data on iron and put your comments below hey guys thank you so much for watching please click the subscribe button and I will see you in the next video	Success
3 Weird Causes of Chronic Fatigue Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-rToZ1Fy8o	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys Dr Burke here I want to talk about the three weird causes of fatigue now there fatigue and i common ones that are not weird but there you know I would never guess them in a million years but being in practice for a long time 27 years uh these things just keep coming up so I want to bring them up and talk about them but let talk about the non-weird causes of fatigue that you probably already know poor sleep or lack of sleep of course you but let causes a sleep problem uh if you watched my videos you probably know this but adrenal stress will do it your bladder waking you up going to the bathroom several times at night will disrupt your sleep and sinus problems from sleep apnea try to sleep if you can digestion try to you know eat too much at night and then try to rest you can because a lot of the nervous system that up to the brain and it keeps your head very very you know uncomfortable and your neck muscles very uncomfortable so so what I did is I listed Down Below in the description what to do for each one of these adrenal we just support the adrenal bladder you want to actually uh fix insulin resistance because that what what problems unless it uh and I talk about that down below sinus you also want to work on the insulin resistance for that a lot of swelling will come down and then digestion there below low okay so poor sleep very common slow thyroid that hypothyroid uh but most thyroid problems are not primarily coming from the thyroid they gallbladder or liver problem okay so let constipated and uh you had your gallbladder removed well guess what your thyroid you can can though if you you don big cause uh and then high estrogen from an overactive ovary will do it a lot of people are estrogen dominant and there a solution for that too but when you have high estrogen that can inhibit the thyroid I put some links Below on what to do for these okay so now let about the kind of the strange weird causes of fatigue that people don realize old head injuries okay I never forget I had a patient come in and she tired we perfect she not working and then I says when did the fatigue start she says when I was 13 years old I said what happened at 13 right before the fatigue she goes I was involved in a car accident um we hit head on and um something hit my head or whatever and I think the windshield and then ever from that point on she tired okay so a head injury will cause you to be be fatigued especially in your head so if you tired chronically you want to ask yourself what part of your body is is fatigued is it your head is it your body is it your eyes did I have a trauma in that part body part right so there is a technique down below that I put down for injury to the head so if you injury to the skull there you can do with acupressure to release some of the trauma okay I put that down below so but that will just keep your head really kind of heavy and tired viral okay low immunity so let that you were in high school and you had Mono Mono is a virus and uh mono basically makes you very very tired well guess what you can come out of remission and go in the remission depending on your stress level and the adrenals so let you you infected well the virus can go out of remission and create fatigue chronic fatigue not necessarily an infection but just chronic fatigue so if this is the case what you would want to do is uh watch the video down below and I show you how to address um probably one of the most common causes of fatigue which should be mono now we getting rid of a virus there technique to help put it remission and it explain it I and see if your energy comes up if it does great okay so it the immune system but that can make you tired especially if you stress okay the last thing which is very it with the ovary if your menstrual cycle is not smooth and light and it heavy and you have menstrual issues let whatever that really can make you TI in fact hormonally it can actually make people um have the blues depressed um that time of the month PMS so it can affect you emotionally so your physical body can affect you emotionally and if you depressed it like fatigue okay so you I uh effect from this hormone imbalance so these are just things that I Brading your Viewpoint to look at every possible reason why you might be tired so we can correct it so I put some links Below on what to do with each one of these all right thanks for watching	Success
Causes & Symptoms of Potassium Deficiency Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWqnMS4ywp0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys dr. Burke here in this video we relationship to your cardiovascular system this little video is based on a really cool article that I put down there to download if you have any cardiovascular problems you need to read this article this is called the new guideline for potassium replacement in clinical practice so it cardiologists who formed the National Council on potassium and they show the importance of potassium for the cardiovascular system so I want to just kind of cover some of the summaries in what potassium can do first of all if you have a potassium deficiency the name of that disorder is called hypo Kali mia hypo and you can remember by kail ka le right hypokalemia that now if you have a potassium deficiency you might feel tired leg cramps muscle weakness constipated tremor because potassium is intimately involved with muscle physiology neurophysiology and cardiovascular physiology so you can also have atrial fibrillation which is a rhythm problem of the heart high blood pressure in fact in most cases of high blood pressure there is a potassium deficiency and what do they give you a diuretic what is diuretics do most of them deplete potassium so it never-ending cycle and then also if you higher pulse rate potassium lowers your pulse rate okay so now the question is how could you possibly get a potassium deficiency right well here are some of the causes one is maybe too much sodium because when you increase sodium you naturally decrease potassium because they work together but maybe it potassium maybe it magnesium sir magnesium so when you magnesium is necessary to keep potassium in the right balance and that comes from the vegetables all right insulin high insulin so let have insulin resistance or you diabetic you know that you to be able to absorb potassium that well and that diamond fluid choose in fact it takes potassium to heal the insulin dysfunction you can almost correct insulin resistance and improve your blood Sugar and then of course too much sugar from the spike insulin will actually deplete potassium too many refined carbs will do it that sugar all of a sudden your pulse rate starts going higher also high cortisol that medication called prednisone that can also deplete your potassium of course you have the diarrhea and vomiting to some degree and then also a condition called alkalosis alkalosis is when your body is just too alkaline and I know you people need to just alkalize the body and all this stuff well actually when you go through a lot of stress and you have high levels of cortisol your adrenal body type your pH becomes more on the alkaline side your blood pH becomes excessively alkaline and that called PAL Colossus and one of the symptoms is a potassium deficiency interesting right surgery in trauma when they do a major abdominal surgery you you because that potassium goes down when you you can create some serious problems with the heart so that give you a potassium IV when you go through surgery and then trauma I remember I had a bike accident went over the handlebars and I let in the cement and my potassium just went down to zero and I think because when you when you go through stress it spikes adrenaline adrenaline will decrease potassium too and then we have low hydrochloric acid when you don stomach you can then you have potassium problems so it takes potassium to keep the stomach acids correct and also taking potassium will help you digest and create stomach acids so so in other words low potassium can create low hydrochloric acid but then adding acid back in can help you absorb potassium drinking too much water or can deplete your potassium because water is not necessarily filled with electrolytes so you take too much water you drink a gallon and you deplete the last bit of potassium you have and then you end up why with all sorts of dehydration problems right diuretic that deficiencies and that comes from when you you the relic and then you become the task and deficient and then you state you continue to have high blood pressure crazy so in this article that I want you to download these doctors are recommending potassium to prevent and even correct a lot of the cardiovascular problems and potassium has the potential to creep your arteries elastic decrease the risk of the stroke and potassium can protect the kidney and even the heart so this whole idea that if you have a kidney problem you absolutely must stay away from potassium is not necessarily true unless it do you get potassium beet tops okay but if you don need to start to increase your salad to seven to ten cups of salad why because it takes that much potassium and we need a lot like close to forty seven hundred milligrams potassium is also good for rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory conditions so you can see this mineral is vital so for more information about nutrition and health and how to create a healthy body check out my website at dr.

The 7 Benefits of Fever Explained by Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKBJrF6-3kw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we seven benefits to a fever now you might think a fever is something bad like a disease or something but it normal that your immune system creates as a defense mechanism against certain infections so it that you don away let of a fever number one it restricts the production of pathogens like bacteria and the reproduction of viruses number two it will decrease the time of infection so if you shut down that fever right away guess what you longer number three it mobilizes your white blood cell it recruits more soldiers to fight the enemy and before it enhances phagocytosis so what does phagocytosis you have these immune cells that have the ability to eat viruses and bacteria and parasites a fever will enhance the ability of a phagocyte to do its job better number five a fever decreases endotoxins and the toxins come from pathogens when a pathogen invades your body and they die they release endotoxins and create all sorts of negative effects guess what a fever can minimize that effect there were six a fever will increase the growth of T cells T cells stand for the thymus cell there are several of them and you have T cells that are killer T cells which are comparable to your special forces you have other T cells that are like commanders which guide and coordinate the entire war against pathogens and then you have other T cells that regulate or moderate the amount of collateral damage so they will kind of put the fire out get rid of inflammation if it gets out of control well fever will actually increase the growth of T cells number seven a fever decreases the mortality rate let for example you affection and you let the fever run its course versus taking something to turn off that fever guess what there interesting studies that if you let the fever do its job you will have a decrease in death rate what you want to do sometimes is enhance the fever get into bed put the covers on and sweat it out take a hot bath all of that really will help in stimulating some of these immune reactions now what is there limit for someone people would say that 99 degrees Fahrenheit would be a normal temperature or the upper limits or some others would say it Fahrenheit as the upper limit of normal temperature that would be thirty seven point two degrees Celsius to thirty-eight point three degrees Celsius the other question is what temperature should you let your body go to and I know people are concerned that if it goes too high they that actually is a myth you would have to really let your body get above 180 degrees to create brain damage in for a long period of time and that could occur if you actually had a fever and you were in a very hot place but typically if you let the temperature rise between 100 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit or 37.8 degrees to 40 Celsius just realize it beneficial thing you the duration of infection you to stimulate enhance the immune defenses and by the way certain immune cells that specialized in killing viruses do it through releasing things like interferon now when interferon is released to kill off the virus you experience the feel like symptoms or muscle aches or even a fever realize those usually are normal let your body go through its process and don off the bat because you could weaken the immune system in its fighting capacity now if you haven to boost the immune system I put right here check it out	Success
How HIV Destroys the Immune System	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MIIzI6wIw0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I wanted to create this video to help you understand a very important thing about the immune system and I relate it to how HIV destroys your immune system now HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus and this virus causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome which is a broadly named condition that can create a lot of problems for someone but mainly you lose your defenses you lose your immune system now this is interesting because this virus has a very unique strategy of attacking something that is so important that it basically knocks the entire army out all by attacking this oneself the T helper cell the T helper cell is one of the t-cells stands for thymus because it actually gets its training in the thymus gland the T helper cell is the most important immune cell because what it does it responses what I mean adaptive responses there you have the primal immune system which you it doesn pretty much takes care of the day-to-day activities of defending you but when things get more threatened you have another part of the immune system called the adapted or the acquired that start to recruit additional very specialized specific cells that do certain jobs this system is all coordinated by the T helper cell I look at this cell like the general that coordinates a plan of attack and recruits the specific types of immune cells that are needed for the battle and also has a lot of estimation and judgment of what type of weapon tree that your body is going to need and what type of power and force that is needed to overcome the enemy which is the virus or the bacteria or some other pathogen HIV virus is very sneaky because it fuses with the t-helper cell and then it starts taking over the DNA and it starts reproducing leaving your T cells completely wiped out basically you don immune system anymore now if you think about it the T helper cells are recruiting killer T cells which are your special forces that are dedicated to killing viruses the stored killer T cells the T helper cell activates and grows the killer T cells it also maximizes the killing power of the macrophages and macrophages are cells that eat viruses and bacteria they sack of acid and enzymes and other chemicals to kill it I hydrogen peroxide the main ingredient to bleach they use that they also have antibiotics and other enzymes so it quite an interesting weapon also the T helper cells activate the B cells B cells stand for bone as in bone marrow that are developed but the B cells are those that make antibodies that help neutralize the chemical reactions the antibodies don pretty much just tag the virus okay as the enemy so these other cells can go there and defined and kill off the virus or bacteria now think about it if you wipe out this cell right here you don get any of these actions right here why am I talking about this well one reason is there is a nutrient that can keep these cells strong and if this nutrient is deficient they talking about vitamin D if you deficient in vitamin D your t helper cells will be suppressed if someone had AIDS it would be very very smart to take a lot of vitamin D and the other thing I want to mention which is also interesting is that this HIV virus not only takes out this t helper self but it also blocks your vitamin D receptors limiting your ability to absorb vitamin D vitamin D is crucial and immune function so apparently this virus is very very sneaky it knocks out not only the main controller but the main nutrient that your body needs to keep the immune system healthy it all comes back to having a strong immune system in the first place to prevent an infection and also understanding the key nutrients involved in that vitamin D is one of the big ones if you wanted to know all the nutrients that are involved in a strong immune system I created a video right here check it out	Success
Are You Turning into a Germophobe?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyHMM-nfDnI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I had a question are you becoming a germaphobe now listen I am NOT against protecting yourself against the corona virus or any virus at all with a mask or washing your hand and you need to do that the point I want to make is this not all germs are harmful or dangerous and I want to make a distinction friendly microbes are not pathogenic okay so pathogens are those microbes that cause disease that includes a virus bacteria fungus candida etc you have as a huge part of your immune system trillions and trillions of friendly microbes around the surface of your body inside your body in your colon and when you over sterilize your body it can lower your immune system and make you more susceptible to having infections these microbes do so much good there certain microbes that make acid that makes a pathogen not want to live in that environment your microbes make vitamins to support your immune system they also have anti-tumor properties and a lot of people get grossed out when they realize that they have an entire universe of microbes living through the body and your environment everywhere you touch there over the place but what they have to realize is when they start to overly destroy the microbes on our body as well as the microbes in our food our resistance to infection goes down because these microbes are symbiotic they actually help form a barrier to protect us and some interesting studies where they have germ-free mice they basically have no microbial life living inside or outside that Mouse they end up with autoimmune diseases allergies asthma and all sorts of other health problems if you look on the surface of your skin it cells there are billions of things living on your skin and I know it of creepy but that and this flora is very very necessary to protecting you it immune defense when you alter this it called microbiome you basically throw the body out of balance and you start getting inflammatory conditions even on the surface of your skin you can have psoriasis you can have a rosacea you can even get acne over sterilization of your body leads to a decrease in T cells and these T cells are formed the adaptive immunity which is really really important in preventing inflammatory reactions throughout the body unfortunately the viewpoint that most people have about germs is very very negative they benefits of these microbes even with your food if you consume too much sterilized food and I food that is pasteurized whether it canned or in a bottle it high temperatures or killing off everything including enzymes or even radiated they actually use radiation on our food nowadays and when you eat these foods that are so-called sterilized it actually creates an immune reaction and it can actually weaken our immune system in summary the point about this video is that you have to realize that you are born with an incredibly complex sophisticated immune system way more powerful as compared to any type of military that ever was on this planet your immune system if you maintain it and you keep it healthy can defend you against just about any attack from any virus or bacteria on this planet and this is why the strategic advantage of the virus is that it can invade someone with a compromised immune system but it can have an extreme disadvantage and a very hard time infecting someone with a strong immune system so if you want more information about how to boost your immune system I put it right here	Success
Use Forest Bathing for Immune Boosting	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oukG5O3IvNE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hi guys I topic today we using forest bathing to boost your immune system now this was used in Japan and 80s for physical and mental health this is not about just actually taking a bath in nature it nature and breathing in or taking in the forest atmosphere so there interesting studies I want to just talk about briefly and they and they relate to being out the forest being exposed to native evergreens like the spruce and pine and other evergreen trees so this is the essence of forest bathing you you from these trees there are essential oils they isolated this really interesting immune benefit from being exposed to certain essential oils that are actually being emitted from the trees in the forest so that group of compounds is fight on sides now there many different individual chemicals in this category but here this chemical significantly increases your natural killer cells now the natural killer cells are part of the immune system under the innate section the innate category of the immune system is something you white blood cells don trained they just know what to do and natural killer cells do a several things one thing is they will punch a hole into cells that have been infected by viruses and caused the cell to commit suicide so they destroy not just a cell but the virus inside it and they have certain chemical weapons that they use there actually three studies and I put the links down below the first study was in 2006 it was performed in a small group of people for three days and two nights that went into the forest and they did before and after testing and they found significant increase in the number of killer T cells as well as a significant spike in this compound the next study was done in 2008 for three days and then they compared that to people that were in the city that actually went out for a and they spend time relaxing they just wanted to differentiate is it something in the forest or is it just about going for a walk okay and they found people in the forest that did the to our walks had significant increase but not only do they find a spike in killer T cells but also in the weapon tree that that cell uses to annihilate virus infected cells now in the last study which was done in 2009 this was done in a hotel room and what they did is they infused this essential oil with this chemical throughout the air and guess what they found they found significant increases in natural killer cells and the weapon tree that they use in addition to that they also check their adrenaline levels and they found that their adrenaline was decrease so not only did they have the immune benefit but they had the stress reduction benefit at the same time and one last thing I wanted to show you okay these are two groups the forest group and the city group and these are all the essential oils that are being admitted from the trees in summary I want to emphasize again and I several videos the great importance of strengthening your immune system and here do it to stimulate your natural killer cells and the weapon tree they use to kill off viruses getting out in nature spending some time walking in the woods being exposed to all these amazing things that are emitted from these trees and one last interesting thing I want to make note of is that the effects that were created in the body lasted for at least a couple weeks once you lockdown hopefully very soon you can get out in the woods be exposed to these trees and really receive the benefit the immune benefits that you can get from being out in nature	Success
What Is a Lymph Node?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Fu8EVSnt54	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let they are a lot of people don know exactly what a lymph node is in relationship to your immune system now the lymphatic system is really an extension from your circulatory system and so all this blood rushes through the body and it goes into the tissues and then from the tissues it turns into lymph and goes through the lymphatic system now the lymphatic system does not have a pump so it body through muscular movement so when all this lymph flows up to the body it gets dumped back into the circulatory system it system to prevent excess fluid retention as in lymphedema however that function the big function and the most important function is the activation of your immune system you will have an entire war going on within your lymph nodes if there is a pathogenic microbes and the pathogen is a microbe that can cause disease one of the purposes of a lymph node is to contain and hold off a pathogen can protect the pathogen from spreading throughout the body so that why you have lymph nodes in your armpits to prevent pathogens from invading your whole arm or even in the back of your throat as the tonsils you have lymph nodes in the side of your neck you have them throughout the abdomen area into the groin there nodes to the body and the largest lymph node is the spleen which is located underneath the ribcage on the left side over here let is inside a lymph node well you have lymph o sites okay those are immune cells that do their work inside the lymphatic system but they can also come outside the lymphatic system and travel around to the tissues there primary lymphocytes one would be the natural killer cells these cells are like part of your special forces they specialized in killing viral infected cells okay so when the virus invades the cells they will kill the entire cell and the virus together also they will attack tumor cells and cancer and this is why sometimes when you have cancer you get swelling of your glands I think people don immune system is not just about fighting infection it cancer from invading the body and this is why when people could cancer and they get chemotherapy destroys the immune system and then they end up with secondary infections and even the cancer can come back so we need our immune system desperately to defend against many different things and then we get the T cells T cells have very specialized functions to kill very specific microbes and they are activated by another immune system called the innate the innate immune system basically is a system that you with these guys don they know what to do they defense but if they need help they hold down the fort and recruit these guys right here and just one of the functions that they will do is they will direct the appropriate attacked recruiting more help to defend against pathogens because we don immune system which will destroy the body yeah we don little immune system either because then the infection goes on forever so it judgement call another function is determining self from non-self so there body tissue that the immune system must tolerate and not attack and that also includes the friendly microbes of your body so that job is very very important because you don your own immune system attack itself as an autoimmune diseases and then we have the B cells which stand for bone marrow and the T cells are thymus and that little gland on top of the heart which is a place where these cells get training and not every t-cell graduates only 30% of those t-cells survive this intense training but the B cells make ant body any microbe these antibodies are like the identification of who needs to be assassinated with a big yellow X on their back also these antibodies are very specific to certain pathogens in fact you have an almost unlimited number of antibodies and I happens in this lymph node is you have a lot of antibody reactions going on you also have the immune system taking tiny parts of pathogens and presenting them to the t-cell this is just one of the ways that your immune system can help locate the good guys from the bad guys you have a lot of lymph blood exchange through this lymph node so you have these lymphocytes going in and out of this tissue all the time and also one of the things that the lymph node will do it lastly I just want to mention this point when someone has their spleen out they have an increased risk of infection and if your lymph nodes actually shrink or become dysfunctional your risk for infection and fighting off these pathogens go way up chronic stress activates cortisol which then shrinks the lymph nodes and the entire lymphatic system but also if you certain dysfunctions with the spleen as well as your lymphatic system in general now if you haven to boost the immune system I put it up right here check it out	Success

Myasthenia Gravis Remission with Vitamin D	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeLaNjsKjNk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey I about an interesting case study that was done by a Brazilian doctor working with a patient who had something called myasthenia gravis this condition is an autoimmune disease that where you have any buddies or they call them Auto antibodies that are against our own tissues you can have an autoimmune disease to just about every single thing in your body this particular autoimmune disease attacks the junction the connection between your nerves and your muscles okay so that what it is and that acetylcholine so you can have a lot of muscle problems specifically in the skeletal muscle and one of the treatments that they normally use is steroids autoimmune conditions produce a lot of inflammation and a steroid is an anti-inflammatory of course the problem there take steroids the amount of vitamin D that this doctor used was between 80,000 and 120,000 international units of vitamin d3 what happened was he was able to put this patients symptoms in remission okay so of course they don ever like to say care or anything like that but in remission means that you don this potentially work and what is a relationship of vitamin D I other videos on this but if you have an autoimmune condition vitamin D is definitely something that you want to consider because vitamin D is not even necessarily a vitamin it in an acts like a steroid without the side effects and the other thing that it does is it supports something called the T regulatory cells and that the immune system that has a really important function in preventing autoimmune diseases the other thing that conditions are viruses and other pathogens and it causes these conditions however there a lot of links and associations but obviously it certain parts of the immune system and now what happens is we have friendly-fire where your body is attacking itself and apparently vitamin D actually supports these selves now one of the reasons why sometimes you have to use high amounts of vitamin D to create this effect is that let autoimmune condition was triggered by a viral infection these viruses have strategies of downgrading the receptor for vitamin D leaving you always deficient and to overcome that that resistance you would have to consume larger amounts of vitamin D and there a huge connection between a lot of autoimmune conditions even MS and a vitamin D deficiency now one of the concerns that people will have when they take this much vitamin D is this one condition called hypercalcemia that means high calcium in the blood and what happens is you may develop kidney stones of course the research isn and there say that the things that this brazilian doctor did was to mitigate this or lessen the risk by omitting any calcium in the diet so it would tell the patient not to consume cheese for example or take calcium supplements so if he wanted to lower your risk for kidney stones what you would want to do is you want to drink at least three and a half to four liters of fluid every single day because in that way you can prevent the urine from being supersaturated where you develop a stone the reason I created this video is basically to show you the relationship between vitamin D and your immune system and potentially even the possibility of keeping an autoimmune condition in remission with something natural like vitamin D if you haven seen my video on M Masson vitamin D I gonna put it up right now check it out	Success

The Potassium-Insulin Connection	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AO00kkx2oE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today I want to talk about the relationship between potassium and insulin it if you are a diabetic or have insulin resistance so insulin is a hormone that causes you to store fat in the presence of insulin it burn fat in this way because insulin prevents the fat burning so it about storing sugar as fat and it preventing the oxidation or breakdown of fat insulin also stores glucose so let say for example you ate some sugar or some refined carbs now the body is going to store that as storage sugar insulin turns glucose into glycogen so this is what glycogen looks like it of glucose molecules held together and stored sugar and you also have potassium involved as well so a potassium is necessary in the storage of glycogen so the main purpose of insulin is to lower your blood sugar and it does that through taking the sugar and putting into storage as glycogen or as fat and if you medication to lower your blood sugar the question is so where being hidden as fat it so basically these medications are taking out of the blood and putting it somewhere else now insulin also helps put the potassium in your cells so that purposes when you consume a high glucose diet or a high carb diet you deplete potassium from the inside of the cell so you lose potassium so if you consume a lot of carbohydrates at one time you gonna show potassium deficiency symptoms like your pulse rate will start going up you blood pressure might go up you may feel palpitations in your heart or heart arrhythmia type symptoms taking potassium makes insulin less resistive as well so it insulin resistance and if you diabetic you have insulin resistance and this is why all diabetics should be making sure they get enough potassium and more to help their blood Sugar normalization of insulin if you deficient in potassium that impair glucose and even increase the risk for instant resistance just by having a deficiency of potassium and then you like a diuretic which then can deplete potassium and cause more high blood pressure and also if you have instant resistance and you metformin and one of the problems in the form and it depletes potassium so my point about this video is if you diabetic make sure you have enough potassium and I created a very important video on diabetes a long time ago and I put it on this page right here check it out you	Success

Anti-Candida and Anti-Fungal Effects of MCT Oil	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMQpmRAs-aE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys today I want to talk about an interesting relationship between candida and MCT oil okay for medium chain triglycerides and that would be a type of fat in coconut oil so there things in coconut oil that are antifungal antimicrobial and that would be one would be lauric acid another one would be MCT oil itself MCT oil has the capacity to reduce Candida in the body now Candida normally lives in our body and it doesn we live with it it doesn harm but when it has an overgrowth as in Candida albicans that problem now what is Candida Candida is a cousin to mold and it fungus so it you get an overgrowth of Candida your tongue becomes white you get a burning sensation in your mouth like an acidic taste cottonmouth which is very dry dry cracked skin and the corners of your mouth also you can actually have like a bad taste in your mouth then you can get fatigue one of the reasons why you tired is that this microorganism competes for nutrients so it start consuming your nutrients and leave you deficient in b6 essential fatty acids low magnesium low iron and vitamin A so having this overgrowth of Candida can create nutritional deficiencies now this normally comes after taking an antibiotic or doing something that destroys your gut flora also Candida releases certain types of toxic materials that can lead to even something called auto-brewery syndrome now this is rare but it body starts fermenting carbohydrates and turning that into alcohol sometimes when you overgrowth of Candida there smell of a fermentation or even an alcohol smell and that happening right here one really really important thing you need to know so if you back in because this is very very important candida and mold and fungus and yeast all live on carbohydrates if you just stop consuming sugar and refined carbs and lower your carbs as an Aikido diet you the candida okay it there recommend to dealing with this candy that one is MCT oil one teaspoon or one tablespoon a day you work up to it it going to be enough over a week or two to actually wipe out Candida as long as you or like I said is antifungal it antimicrobial the other thing that very very important is to do fasting fasting kind of resets your gut it stops feeding the pathogens and believe it or not your own good bacteria and a friendly fungus start to become stronger and more diverse now you think that starving your microbes would make it worse but no it actually they live longer they do much better so fasting will also stimulate a condition called a Tov G and that condition where your body is starting to eat up microbes and recycle them so as a therapy fasting would be great for Candida versus consuming like six small meals a day or three meals and two snacks not good the other thing that can help the byproduct or the detoxification would be to take the trace mineral molybdenum this particular trace mineral helps reduce the side effects of Candida if you want more information about Candida check out this video right here	Success

The Ignored Pandemic: Vitamin D Deficiency	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFjcC6Htlig	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let the ignored pandemic when we about a pandemic we large group of the population worldwide and I but there are over 1 billion people on this planet that are either deficient in vitamin D or have vitamin D insufficiency which means that they might have a subclinical or somewhat of a deficiency but not a full-blown vitamin D deficiency but vitamin D is such a necessity for so many biochemical reactions there reactions in fact 5 percent of the genome is influenced by vitamin D it not just involved with bone health and calcium metabolism it in your immune system and that want to focus on now these four countries are very deficient in vitamin D China India South America and the Middle East and when a woman is pregnant and she eating the food with vitamin D or not supplementing she could become very deficient very fast because that baby inside is just sucking the vitamin D for growth and development also if a woman is locked 80 that can create a deficiency unless she or getting a lot of Sun and infants commonly are vitamin D deficient now if you don specific things happen within the immune system the T helper cells have a difficult time working those are the cells that would be equivalent to the general of an army they communication and coordination of the entire military team also the T regulatory cells are influenced highly with vitamin D and these cells prevent autoimmune reactions they also involved with suppressing inflammatory responses especially in the lung there condition called cytokine storm which is involved in acute respiratory distress syndrome which is actually killing people with a weak immune system without vitamin D it inappropriate immune reaction so vitamin D is regulating how much inflammation or how little inflammation you need to overcome an infection vitamin D also can help to inhibit the iron in certain cells because certain pathogens actually eat the iron so vitamin D is needed to help to prevent these microbes from getting that iron also those vitamin D receptors in a lot of immune cells themselves and one of the purposes of the receptors to help convert the inactive vitamin D to the active form of vitamin D now there called the macro fashion and this mewn cell actually eats garbage and it also eats viruses and bacteria and other microbes so vitamin D stimulates the number of macrophages as well as the the pre macrophage which is the monocyte turning into the macrophage and lastly vitamin D helps to make antimicrobial weapons they wonders to show you the very important link between having not enough vitamin D and what it potentially can do to your immune system and the vital importance of using vitamin D as a preventative thing as well as something you can use if someone is sick or if they have pre-existing health problems conditions like cardiovascular disease high blood pressure diabetes obesity all are vitamin D deficient if you have friends or family that have these pre-existing health problems and they about the virus get them on vitamin D especially if they I mean right now there doctors that are recommending hydroxychloroquine and zinc and an antibiotic but also add in the vitamin D now I also want to mention how people are deficient in vitamin D as we get older it D especially in the skin because the skin becomes thickened and so when sunlight hits our skin you just don get the full capacity vitamin D version like you had when you 20s the more clothing you have the more vitamin D deficient it to get vitamin D from your diet the Sun is the best way to get vitamin D but you also have to be exposed to the Sun so wearing a bunch of clothing is not going to help the latitude of where you live the closer you live to the equator the more vitamin D you could potentially get people that live in the northern hemisphere typically have lower amounts of vitamin D excluding the Nordic countries and that is because they consume a lot of fish I mean think about where you would get cod liver well it from that area of the world the more pollution that you have the more deficient you and this would be a really good evaluation to evaluate the most polluted areas in the world and then look at the outbreaks the infection rate and the death rates I already know in Italy the most polluted cities have the highest mortality situations I do know that in Rihan China it color what determines the color of skin is melanin and melanin actually protects against UV radiation the darker your skin is the less vitamin D you to be able to absorb and then we just have the general the health of your skin if you have very unhealthy skin then you capacity absorb vitamin D the more sunblock that you use the less vitamin D now genetics yes there are genetic weaknesses that prevent you from absorbing vitamin D and that wanted to pause and just talk about this for a second polymorphism what are polymorphisms well we have 63 of them and basically they a alteration or a variation of the vitamin D receptor if you have an infection let this chronic infection that goes on for months and months microbes tend to deplete you a vitamin D both because they block the vitamin E scepter and also because your immune system is needing more vitamin D to work so the more infections you have or the more chronic and infection is the more vitamin D you lastly if you have malabsorption for example if you have gut damage or some inflammatory condition your gut that is going to prevent the absorption of vitamin D if you want more information about vitamin D I put up a video right here check it out	Success

Hydroxychloroquine versus Remdesivir	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBma_0oAiMI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I guess I hydroxychloroquine to REM des a very which is another drug that they got done studying and I want to just compare the two so there mistake by the World Health Organization when they sent the study to various publications so The Lancet medical journal was rushing to publish a study right away because of the success of this drug and they accidentally sent the wrong study they sent a Chinese trial which by the way was randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled with 237 patients the problem with publishing the wrong study using this drug by the way there was not an association with statistically significant clinical benefits with this medication whoops so they republished the correct study that they wanted to show which involved over a thousand patients and it was randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial but it only really showed a moderate improvement in recovery time from 15 days of recovery to 11 days of recovery it improvement but really nothing else and of course this drug is not going to be cheap it percent more than the flu vaccine so you see this in the media they excited they finally found a drug that is somewhat workable it as they completely ignore the hydroxychloroquine in fact the media tends to filter out and showing in the studies that don it worse when and actually they really bogus studies they were based on a survey it unless you read it you that out and by the way as a side note hydroxychloroquine does decrease the risk of thrombosis and if you haven seen my video on the relationship between clotting and the coated 19:00 virus check it out just another benefit of this drug however there is a new study I down below of a French virologist who tested hydroxychloroquine and an antibiotic that showed that ninety one point seven percent of all the patients that were tested fork over 19 and 10 days did not test positive for the virus this is incredible this should be on the front page of that is not this drug right here the mortality rate or death rate was 0.5 percent with no cardiac toxicities and this is an extremely inexpensive drug I think it the drugs that are really cheap don get a lot of attention now I stayed this far because I show you an amazing story and Africa related to this drug that I think you enjoy it that has the scientific know-how to beat the virus in Senegal a laboratory is used it develop a $1 Kovan 19 testing kit al-jazeera senegal is doing what most countries counts testing everyone symptoms are not entering a health center for the novel coronavirus it has no shortage of testing kit thanks to this lab at the STG beste researchers are developing a $1 quick diagnostic kit originally made to test for dengue fever patients drop blood or saliva onto the devices and wait for a blood line to appear like a pregnancy test explains researcher a Medusa there is no need for a highly equipped lab it anywhere the idea is to rapidly produce two to four million kids not just for us but for African countries so that we can detect it and isolate patients quickly the sick are administered a cheap anti-malarial drug called chloroquine commonly found in sub-saharan Africa where malaria is endemic with only 50 ventilator machines for 16 million people Senegalese engineer are using a 3d printing machine to produce more while imported ventilators cost $16,000 this one is just $60 Senegal is counting the cost and it more than a month into the outbreak the small West African nation suffered only two deaths with most patients treated healed Senegal has the largest rate of recovery in patients infected with the corona virus in Africa the third in the world ahead of countries like the United States and France and while it has a tiny health budget compared to those countries it has a wealth of experience in dealing with infectious diseases and outbreaks amazing isn great success rate put your comments down below	Success
How Your Feet Are Warning You About Your Liver Problems - Dr. Berg Explains	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsTmgX32Uk8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys today we foot as a way of diagnosing the liver and of course my disclaimer here is that you disease you have to go to the doctor and have them do tests to figure that out but this will give you some good clues on a potential problem with your liver okay that being said let these are just little indicators that can actually help you narrow things down the first thing we about is the little red and brown dots they can be larger and smaller and you can also have like little shininess to them they that is poor circulation and that is usually a liver problem it could also be diabetes it could be many other things but you see this a lot when people have liver problems so the actual appearance of the lower leg and the foot gives a lot of great information about the overall health of the person because the heart has to send blood all the way down to your feet and then back through the vascular system and usually if there liver problem or a heart problem whatever there problem and you part of your body a lot because the poor circulation that these problems happen at a the greatest distance from the heart and also even with diabetes for example you see neurological problems in your feet in your hands because of that fact because it affects the distal fingers which is the the point furthest away from the heart okay so you little discoloration type specks on the lower leg and then something called spider veins or another name would be spider nevus which usually see this in cirrhosis and what liver is you estrogen and too much estrogen can affect the vascular system so you can see varicose veins and spider veins and you can see them in the lower legs then we have cracked heels okay this is usually a vitamin b3 deficiency or an omega-3 fatty acid deficiency why because one of the functions of the liver is to make bile and help you absorb these fatty acids not just omega-3 fatty acids but vitamin A which could be involved in the skin vitamin E which could be involved in the skin those are fat soluble vitamins but vitamin b3 also affects the skin other B vitamins also can affect the skin as well just how they relate to the cofactor the to help the enzymes work especially with proteins so b3 deficiency can create a problem another name for that would be pellagra people with pellagra which is a B 3 deficiency have a lot of skin issues all right each of the foot usually in the bottom of the foot that is a backup of fluids into the liver it it could be bio backing up and you getting a buildup of histamines a congested liver so you could have itching in the foot also you can have pain or inflammation in the bottom of the foot a lot of times people associate that with something called plantar fasciitis where it fasciitis it then you also have hot feet hot feet is another symptom of a bad liver and then we have bad odor so you have smelly feet why because the liver is not able to detoxify correctly and it through the skin usually it delivers bad the person entire body is backed up with garbage and especially the large intestine and the kidneys and it the skin so you can terrible unhealthy bad liver and have a very healthy kidney or colon there if one is bad they all pretty congested and unhealthy okay pitting edema that your finger into the lower leg and it leaves a dent and it just stays there that liver symptom and then we have fungus toenail fungus people with liver problems have a higher level of fungus growing on their body because they they micro flora and the gut and that is going to relate to an overgrowth of fungus and yeast and the outside of the body so that and psoriasis toenail fungus and then the the nail bed in it you can actually happen on the hands or the feet the nail bed is going to be white you moon shape thing Luna down here so it going to be white because of the poor circulation that bad alright so then the next question is what really causes liver problems a lot of things one big one is the side effect from medications another one is a lot of sugar in the diet especially high fructose corn syrup cooked foods so if you are pasteurized and you anything raw that be very very hard on the liver and the kidney and also a lack of any vegetables and if you with that you have no enzymes to put in the body no antioxidants from these vegetables so that can be a problem excessive alcohol that and then excessive protein so if you doing massive amounts of protein it built up a lot of nitrogen waste over time that can then overload the liver and the kidney and put a lot of stress on and so if there is liver damage or kidney damage you want to go a little lower on the protein higher in the vegetables okay so now what is a good diet for the liver now if you the link down below I will show you a combination of a healthy ketogenic diet and intimate fasting okay so that I that are not new and you channel if you watch a lot of videos you already know this you you go ahead and put your comments down below so the new people can see that this that really does work alright thanks for watching if you subscribe now and I will actually keep you updated on future videos	Success

ItÂs Not The Virus that Kills You, ItÂs Your Immune System	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooTKyjlo6s	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so it it let doesn alive how can something not alive actually kill you well what happens is this you have this inactive shell with some DNA material in there that has very specific instructions to replicate because there surface of that virus that connect to certain tissues and certain receptors in your cell like a lock and a key now Co mid-nineteen connects to what the ACE 2 receptor and yourselves and then they once they system doesn to get into the cell as fast as possible and start to replicate and it hijacks your copy machine your machinery your metabolism to replicate so that actually creating a lot of damage and then it creates this immune reaction however that kills you is this take a look at this we have two parts of the immune system we have the innate which is the system that doesn first line of defense and then we have the special forces called the adapted part of the immune system so if we think about a worst case scenario you intensive care you you going on in lung it storm which is a condition where your lungs are on fire there going on there there it which then creates bleeding and fibrosis and scar tissue where you eventually just stop breathing also this destructive inflammatory condition is happening on the inside of your arteries and it can even create blood clots you might want to look at this as an overreacting immune system but in reality it this part of the immune system is only overreacting because part of this system is not working so you have what the T suppressor cells these cells suppress or regulate the over reaction one of the purposes is to prevent too much inflammation they basically are the fire department that floods the water to put out the fire they also prevent autoimmune diseases but this is your car this would be the brake pad and this is the accelerator so we have this severe imbalance where we lose this and then we have too much of this and that what trigger and it damage in this area but you have to realize that the virus really only kills people with a weak immune system and it conditions that are causing a weakness within these specific cells right here now in the HIV virus that targets what called the T helper cell this cell is like the quarterback within the entire immune system and it just will knock this guy right out and now there actually no control you have no more immune system and that would die other strategies will block your vitamin D levels and if you don have enough vitamin D these cells can out the fire this is why vitamin D is very anti-inflammatory not having enough vitamin D can create this imbalance certain viruses can create this imbalance having a pre-existing health issue can create this imbalance as well so you put all these things together and you problems but you have to realize it not the virus itself that is creating this it going on at the same time now one of the defense mechanisms that your immune system has is creating a fever because creating a fever decreases the duration of infections in fact it increases your chances of living because it slows down the viral replication but if your immune system is weak guess what you may not even have a fever not having a fever yet having an infection means that your immune system is broken also having a preexisting health problem you already are going into this condition with low amounts of antioxidants the problem with that is that this overreaction is creating so much inflammation so much oxidation so many free radicals if we don that that whole video is really about emphasizing the importance over your immune system because if your immune system is strong this virus really does not play a big threat especially if you understand how to strengthen it but if you want information on that I put the video up right here check it out	Success
The Benefits of Mucus	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oS-3LM6c5Ks	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys let mucus and I know it disgusting topic but I think it underrated I think it enough it of your body you make between 1 & 1 & a half liters of mucus every single day you of it is sitting on a mucous membrane covering the inside of your body and the size of that membrane is huge it is 400 square meters now how can that be well if you take a look at the inside of your body there there are a lot of it your intestines then look like that so if you were to stretch them out it quite large so that would be the size of two tennis courts or one large basketball court and so the mucus membrane is part of your immune system and you have all of your friendly bacteria that live in the mucus that are protecting you you have your own immune cells that are ready they an invader and there are millions of invaders all the time trying to get into their body and the immune systems job is to prevent it from getting in and invading because it creates a lot of damage the good bacteria that you have are friendly they exchange with you they give you compounds that are very beneficial but these pathogens don they do is they take your nutrients they create destruction they don anything good and that would be a definition of a criminal right this mucous membrane and the mucus on top of it lines the sinuses the mouth the throat the lungs the stomach think about it your acid in your stomach it ranges between 1 and 3 this acid is so strong why doesn tissues because of the mucus it protective thing in testo mucus you have mucus in your kidneys urogenital so anyway there what does it do it acts as a lubricant okay it also is antimicrobial you have all sorts of enzymes that are sitting in there you can vision the mucus as like a flytrap so this microbe comes by it gets stuck in there certain enzymes start dissolving it and killing it it great way to prevent pathogens from invading the body because you have this dislike this gel thing that gets stuck in also all the good bacteria in there create an environment so it makes it very difficult for them to get in and there these little things right here that kind of like a lock and a key attached to certain pathogens and bind them and prevent them from doing anything so they can just dry up and and die so you have millions and billions of these antibodies that are very specific to certain microorganisms now I already mentioned the flytrap because they like a trap it contain a pathogen much like a spiderweb actually but the main purpose of mucus is a barrier to the pathogen now realize to when your sinuses are congested not all of that is mucus there inflammation and swelling and there mucus as well but it swelling and the mean reaction that creating the congestion now there couple things you can do to thin the mucus there called NAC you can get this as a supplement and that is really good if you have real thick mucus and you need to actually kind of loosen it up but out of all the vitamins the most important vitamin for the mucous membranes is vitamin A if you A you problems a lot of allergies a lot of irritation inflammation in the mucous membranes the next most important vitamin for this mucus would be vitamin D why because vitamin D is an anti-inflammatory and there conditions within the mucous membranes that involve inflammation so anyway I hope you now appreciate this amazing thing called mucus	Success
Oxidative Stress, Immune System, and Viral Infection	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlT2ToOPtco	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I want to talk about oxidative stress and viruses so lately there focus on how the Koba 19 virus is killing people and it has to do with something called oxidative stress and that imbalance of too much oxidation and not enough antioxidants now your body actually makes oxidation or oxidants it also makes antioxidants that endogenous which means that it from within then you have exogenously nation which is coming from the outside like pollution smoking consuming refined carbs and sugar all increase oxidation now the other thing is that when you get in viral infection let the Koba 19:00 virus on a blood test you in low lymphocytes let me explain what that means neutrophils are part of the innate immune system and they are a type of phagocyte that has three ways of killing things it can release chemicals that kill the pathogen it can eat the pathogen it can also throw a net over the pathogen and kill it that way as well because there are certain chemicals that are released a couple chemicals that are released from the neutrophil are hydrogen peroxide and bleach or the main chemical in Bleach and these two chemicals are the weapons that the neutrophil uses to kill microbes and they create a lot of oxidation so we have our own immune system that is creating this oxidation in response to Koba 19 or some other virus and of course the virus is creating other immune reactions which is then contributing to more oxidation then we have the risk factors that are related to Koba 19 that would be diabetes obesity high blood pressure so with obesity you have a situation where you have a lot more oxidation and inflammation diabetes you lot of oxidation the high amounts of sugar and the same thing with cardiovascular disease definitely with the autoimmune conditions all of those not only make you susceptible to getting the infection but having a lot of complications the complications of these pre-existing conditions let diabetes you neuropathy of your feet your vision is affected you have heart problems and especially the lungs the other problem with having a pre-existing health problem is that when you do your endogenous antioxidants which means the amount of antioxidants that your body is making is way way less so we have this imbalance that itself and then the immune system or reaction which creates more of this on top of that having a preexisting health problem is just enough to really throw this thing out of balance to then really have an influence on your mortality so to have a long healthy life and to minimize the complications of not only in this condition but the side effects of the viral infection you need to take these antioxidants and bring them up and bring this right down here some people that are infected never even notice one symptom at all yet other people really get hammered really it these conditions it damage now the other thing that viruses will do they will attack the mitochondria which is the energy Factory so that cells are actually dying but there going to be some cells that survive this attack and they the respiratory center is damaged which is the normal machinery to burning fuel it will adapt to another way of using fuel and that which doesn older system that our body doesn normally use unless it needs to use it as a survival mechanism so here we have several cells that have adapted and they back up machinery or generator to actually use fuel and they metabolize glucose so this is one way that a virus can trigger cancer what about this mechanism is that as soon as a cell switches over to this new type of machine it will lose its ability to die in other words cancer cells are immortal and that about this because the way that the cancer cell spreads and takes over is that it just continues to grow and grow and grow where our normal cells they have a certain limit where they will grow too and then they will die off so yes they become zombies and they just hog up all the fuel but remember they can only eat glucose but the cancer cells will also create a tremendous amount of inflammation free radical damage and oxidation so we have a lot of things going on so what can we do to switch this back well number one you want to start fixing the pre-existing health problems okay the metabolic syndrome the the diabetes the heart disease you do that with changing the diet but at the same time we also want to start eating foods high in these things called antioxidants this will do two things number one it will put the fire out of this oxidative state in other words if you antioxidants you complications of these conditions and minimize the complications of viral infections that I inflammation if you are in the hospital with Koba 19:00 you should be taking as many oxidants as you can get vitamin A vitamin C especially about an indeed about a man II here lipoic acid then you have trace minerals that act as antioxidants copper zinc especially zinc selenium is a big one manganese vitamin b-12 6 and 12 are all considered antioxidants having good microbes also will help increase your antioxidants so if you get an antibiotic guess what you wipe out the good bacteria and your antioxidants go down another really good antioxidant is called NAC this antioxidant is used for tylenol poisoning because Tyla will destroy the liver if you take this it will reduce the amount of oxidation cure Citan is a really good one especially for people that have allergies that have a lot of inflammation fasting will increase your network of antioxidants very very important to know about that exercise will also increase your network of your endogenous antioxidants and getting enough sleep will also increase this so we can actually decrease that right here now if you haven video right here this is the next one you need to watch check it out	Success
Is Keto Dangerous? High Fat Ketogenic Diet & Clogged Arteries Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmJSw0x3Rl0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hi guys Dr Burke here in this video I want to talk about will doing a high fat ketogenic diet clog your arteries now just from the pure um observation of eating more fat and a a fatty clogged artery it sounds logical that if you were to eat more fat you a clogged artery okay it sounds logical that you would eat more fat and then get more fat in your body right but that not how it works in the body body because in the body there are various hormones that tell certain types of calories um what to convert into and the the hormone that tells the body whether to clog the artery or clean out the artery really is called insulin so insulin is like the switch that converts fat into the body of storage and also clogs arteries uh insulin is a very um inflammatory hormone if you have too much of it you can have a lot more inflammation which can set you up for a whole series of events um from the body start healing the inflammation or the lesion in your arteries with a combination of cholesterols ab Band-Aid calcium and fibrous fibrin which is kind of a connect connective tissue to form a little bit of a clot so really what would started that would be the high levels of insulin not necessarily consuming cholesterol now cholesterol is made by every almost every single cell in the body your body makes about 3,000 milligrams of cholesterol every single day that 3,000 milligrams of cholesterol is equal to 300 strips of bacon it butter it body makes a lot of cholesterol okay so when you consume more fat your body just makes more less okay that really creates this clogged artery is high levels of insulin by consuming too many carbohydrates um so if you were to cut your carbohydrates down like the breads pasta cereal crackers things like that and sugar if you were to cut that down you would notice your cholesterol would go way down also your triglycerides would go way down your bad cholesterol would go down but but if you were to increase the sugar and the insulin your cholesterol goes up and you should even experiment with yourself to see if this is true for you um but what I wanted to give you is I have a little mini course that it done in maybe 20 minutes on ketosis to give you the basics I show you how it works what to eat the tweaks that I recommend and the side effects it put a link down below so if you familiar with ketosis you can take the course it 20 minutes and really have a better understanding of it so check that out and thank you so much for watching	Success

Why Does Vitamin D Lower Blood Pressure	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqsK__FAEd0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let vitamin D actually help someone with hypertension and by the way anything they say is not meant to replace your medical care don drugs unless you check with your doctor but if you are a medication and you not taking vitamin D then you might want to consider taking it especially after what I tremendous amount of research which I put down below on this one topic one of the most commonly prescribed drugs for hypertension is an ACE inhibitor now I just released a video on the ACE receptor as it relates to Coba 19 you should check that out if you haven seen it hypertension is one of the top risk factors for having complications from koban 19 and out of all the people that are taking medication for hypertension 48% of them are taking ace inhibitors as the first medication to help them lower the pressure alright what is a stand for angiotensin converting enzyme so this drug inhibits this enzyme and this enzyme relates to an entire system in your body which is called renin angiotensin system ras I don other than this system helps regulate blood pressure fluid balance electrolyte balance so that next thing to know is this vitamin D lowers this system tons and tons of research ok now my thought is that and this is just my theory that the reason why this is high in the first place is the person has a vitamin D deficiency now why do I say that because 75% of the population has some level of deficiency with vitamin D so this is something you definitely want to research yourself and bring up to your doctor if you medication this is what I would recommend ten thousand international units to 20 thousand international units of vitamin d3 with vitamin k2 I mean k2 works with vitamin D this alone will help to slow down the calcium buildup in the arteries so this is very very good as well but if you here take a hundred micrograms if you going to take this amount take 200 micrograms of k2 ok now if someone tells you that that much vitamin D is toxic or it them show you evidence of that there actually no evidence of that whatsoever I mean if they tell you it create high calcium in the blood it called hypercalcemia just have them show your reference they won find it the only reference on that shows that if you hundred thousand international units of vitamin A for a long period of time potentially it could create kidney stones but if you I that alright if you were also to add some potassium to this I think you would even be more successful and I a thousand milligrams a day because a potassium deficiency will cause high blood pressure as well in fact it will cause the arteries to stiffen if you deficient in potassium and you can get a lot of potassium if you also consume a large amount of greens like salad or vegetables so anyway I just wanted to bring this up if you weren vitamin D and relationship to blood pressure you definitely need to know about it because it inexpensive solution to a very common problem with another amazing recipe no green no sugar there absolutely not and it builder not so that you have to check this out I think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it easy it making it as much as we are enjoying eating it	Success
How to Stop Bedwetting in Children? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbhcGOGScAU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys Dr Burg here in this video we wedding so if your child has a problem with this what I the fastest way to correct it okay number one uh you have to realize that the root cause of bed weding is the exact same cause as adults getting up through the night peeing and that has to do with higher levels of insulin insulin regulates blood sugars and I talking being becoming a diabetic you could be a pre diabetic for 10 years before you have any symptoms but one of the symptoms of insulin resistance is excessive urination at night because whatever what happens is wherever the sugar goes the wa the liquid goes the water goes and because insulin regulate trigger it out through the urine and it actually happens more at night now let look at the pancreas pancreas makes insulin the insulin is there to regulate sugars what happens over time if there if there here the uh cells start to resist it okay they block it so what happens the signals don as a communication it the child and he not listening to you not getting return communication so you increase the volume right well that what your pancreas does too it increases the volume of that communication because hormones are communication and so then we actually get more and more and more insulin being pumped out because we not getting that turn communication because we have resistance to insulin in the receptor so cases with insulin resistance have five to seven times more insulin than normal uh people so one test that you could do not necessarily blood sugars that may be a good test to do but that shows up normal check a fasting insulin test if you really want to figure this out or you can just go by the symptoms which is uh tiredness irritability can without eating when the when the child eats feels much better and calms down these are all symptoms of insulin resistance I mean I had this when I was a kid and no one knew what it was of course I lived on sugar and that thing you the refrigerator and out of the house is get rid of the sugar unfortunately because that problem um the key is doing three meals a day no more snacks so what you going to have to do is you have to make sure those meals have enough nutrition in them and also enough healthy fat that will allow the child to go longer I put some links down below for these healthy fat treats that you can make for the child and they called keto bombs so you make them they really good and you can give those to the child at the meal not in between the meal and that way he or she is satisfied for the whole between the meals okay so then we got healthy fat no snacking lots of greens you can problems without vegetables because vegetables contain the potassium that we need to heal insulin resistance and that can find is some supplement with potassium if you but we really want to go with the vegetables some kids will not consume vegetables so what I like to do is do a shake maybe we put spinach or kale I like kale and I will for kids I banana in there I I have this salad in a drink so that way to hide the vegetables and have them consume that and it can get them to do that now and also some protein 3 to six ounces of protein with the meal so we have a combination of vegetable protein and fat we doing the starch we potatoes we doing grains we pastas or cereal C cereal biscuits waffles we because this is what the problem is we want to correct it a good supplement is to find something with chromium and B vitamins nutritional yeast is a good source and some supplement to support healthy insulin levels why because with kids uh sometimes that actually speed up the process okay so I just wanted to cover what to do if your child has bed waiting and go ahead and apply this and put your comments below I want to hear the success thanks for watching	Success

The Sun's Benefits Are Way More than Vitamin D	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYP-VTctWq4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let interesting benefits from the Sun that go beyond just vitamin D so as you know when the Sun hits your skin there certain chemical reactions that occur that generate vitamin D from cholesterol in your skin so people are always against cholesterol but you need cholesterol to actually make vitamin D okay so there cholesterol but check this out when the Sun hits your skin and the retina okay through your eye you get a chemical conversion of increasing serotonin and serotonin can greatly affect your mood this is why of course when you better and when the winter comes and it it goes on and on in fact when I originally graduated from college I wanted to go and live in Washington State okay it was just beautiful there and I just loved the whole scenery and and how green the grass was well little did I know the reason why it much in fact for six months I don think the Sun came out at all and I got really depressed so I moved from Washington State down to California actually right next to the Mojave Desert to dry out all the Sun and my mood definitely went up so there is a relationship between the Sun and your mood via certain hormones okay number two it effects melatonin actually reduces melatonin melatonin is the hormone that helps you sleep so darkness stimulates melatonin but light Sun will decrease this this makes you sleepy so the Sun wakes you up okay so another benefit number three the heat from the Sun and the humidity that generated from the Sun and also the environment has the power to decrease viral loads even from Co vat19 and this is where you into the summer you that a lot of people are going to do much much better simply because the reproduction of that virus is affected by the temperature and the humidity of the environment and this is why these viruses a lot of times are seasonal like influenza comes out in the winter but kind of goes away in the summer now number four UV this is a wavelength that you antibacterial effects and this has nothing to do with vitamin d UV inhibits the growth of certain bacteria and other microbes even through glass it can actually inhibit tetanus typhoid TB staph strep and many other microorganisms are number five the Sun will increase resistance to infection so it helps your immune system alright number six the infrared wavelength of the Sun is great for wound healing and decreasing pain there types of therapy using infrared and if you haven D from the Sun you got to check that out I put it right here	Success

Black Plague Pandemic New Discovery	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IBdD_-wsjo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we Black Plague and the somewhat recent discovery about the true nature of this pandemic which is actually quite interesting because it relates to nutrition so this pandemic roughly occurred in the year 13:48 and don around this period of time it could happen a little bit before or a little bit after but there are between 70 to 200 million people who died in that pandemic and the discovery that they made was in an unmarked grave in the north part of London where they dug up these skeletons and they study these skeletons and they found a good handful of these skeletons had rickets I don know if you know much about rickets but all you need to know is that is a vitamin D deficiency they also found they had very bad teeth which is also a vitamin D deficiency they found they were anemic based on the bone composition they also found a lot of injuries as if these people were in a war and right around that time there was a war in fact there was a war for a hundred years so you have the combination of malnutrition and a war that would create a perfect storm for a weakened immune system I mean think about it if a child has rickets and there have rickets the parents are also going to have a vitamin D deficiency because rickets is a severe vitamin D deficiency you can imagine if you vitamin D you good immune system at all because the vitamin D deficiency will create a susceptibility to infection and also will lower the number of white blood cells that infection also it creates a weakness within the strength of your white blood cells they generate the weapon tree to defend themselves so you send in the battle without the weapons and they all get killed you also will have less control over inflammation especially in now this also relates to a pandemic that occurred in 1918 called the Spanish flu in which over I think 50 to a hundred million people died now what was interesting about this pandemic versus this one there one also peaked in the dead of winter in January which is the time of the year where you had the least amount of vitamin D in the body also you had a war World War one and in that war you had a huge shift in what people ate they had to preserve foods and they started canning foods and boxing foods and anytime you do that you start dropping the nutritional levels big-time so you really didn nutrient-dense foods especially the soldiers and because this was a world war involving many different countries you had many more people dying and you also had a lot of malnutrition all over the globe so my point about this pandemic was this also was related to malnutrition I mean take a look at coba 19 the people that are dying are older and people with a weakened immune system that just as much as we washing your hands so if you wanted more information about how to boost a healthy immune system check this video out right here	Success
Why People Smoke Cigarettes Explained By Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1M54DRxZ3U	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hi guys Dr Berg here in this video we going to talk about why people smoke cigarettes okay well primarily because they want to look cool right not necessarily maybe that was the original reason but there why would someone want to smoke cigarettes when it has 4,000 chemicals it has 42 known carcinogens those are things that cause cancer carbon monoxide fahid cyanide arsenic DDT cadum Benzene fungicides why would anyone smoke well primarily because it creates relaxation sharpness more alertness and calmness okay so it Addictive nicotine okay nicotine is a very calming effect on the body it vasodilator it relaxes the body so nicotine is very very very addicting and it creates these positive effects but it comes with a package of all these harmful things right here it interesting if you were to take the nicotine patch or take consume nicotine it does not cause cancer it doesn these chemicals that cause cancer so yeah the patch The Vapor um cigarette is way way better okay now the way that nicotine works is that it stimulates part of the nervous system called the parasympathetic nervous system and I want to talk about that you have two parts the nervous system well actually there we sympathetic nervous system that flight or fight that and then you have the parasympathetic and that flight or fight rest and digest so it a calming relaxing nervous system that also you know just chills you out and helps you focus too um so the parasitic nervous system is stimulated by nicotine the problem is nicotine is very very very addictive um so when someone stops taking nicotine what happens is you have all sorts of things that happen with the parastic nervous system that thing shuts down you no longer feel relaxed you no longer feel sharp you feel irritated go through all sorts of withdrawals for about two weeks um or longer so my suggestion now that you understand what we the pth or the vapor cigarette okay that eventually come off nicotine because even though it effects of causing cancer it highly addictive and it can wear out the adrenals and this system over a period of time okay because you need more and more it several things that you can do to to create this effect by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system okay one is uh taking adaptogens those are like ashwaganda certain herbs that actually calm the nervous system down and actually trigger the parasympathetics potassium is also the mineral that improves the parasympathetic because it that Believe It or Not helps stimulate the parasympathetic also green tea as well but you decaffeinated uh B1 vitamin B1 also improves the parasympathetic nervous system interesting and walking as far as an exercise like calm lots of oxygen low stress exercise uh or yoga would be really good to trigger this system all right so I just wanted to kind of give you a background of why people really smoke they trying to get some relief with stress but why not just improve this another way okay without this stuff right here because it comes with a package all right put your comments below and let me know what you think	Success
The 7 Nutrients That Get Rid of Love Handles (Belly Fat) Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6brnHI1S1Y	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys in this video we want to talk about the seven nutrients that can get rid of your love handles okay now the point I want to make first is that some of this you videos but I important thing and that has to do with what these nutrients do not directly to the fat but to the insulin that is too high that makes the fat in the gut if you have love handles if you have belly fat you basically have too much insulin that we do to lower insulin versus the love handles these are the nutrients that will do it potassium uh where do you get potassium from beet tops so those beets that you buy at the grocery store uh that you might steam don the tops cut the tops up uh the green part and put those in your salad okay or put those in your blender I like to freeze them and I put them in my kale shake with a little bit of fruit I sorry berries not actual other fruit um okay greens just salads in general and avocados very very high in potassium you need a lot you need like four to five thousand milligrams every single day now vitamin D vitamin D will help lower insulin cod liver oil actual liver if you like liver grassfed Sun mushrooms okay that you can also get an egg yolks things like that uh and then fiber from vegetables so if you were to consume uh carrot juice for example which basically is a juice without the fiber you could Spike the insulin but of course the fiber in the juice in the I the carrot in the Beet and these other vegetables buffer any type of sugar that for example it is going to buffer and that fruit is way better than fruit juice best vegetables are better than vegetable juice because the fiber fiber does slow down the um glycemic index but also uh fiber can feed the microbes in your gut that then make a certain acid that feeds the coal in and that actually helps insulin resistance too so even though I don a nutrient uh I just don but I just don nutrient especially an essential nutrient but it in a lot of different things now also MCTS medium chain triglycerides those are certain types of fats that actually help um lose weight and they will help you uh enhance the fat burning process and you can get that from coconut oil palm oil um okay next one is magnesium pumpkin seeds are loaded with magnesium spinach Swiss chard almonds other nuts loaded with magnesium very important and that will actually usually the foods that are uh that have potassium also have magnesium so you can kill two birds with one stone vitamin B1 will decrease the need of insulin so again um you burn up B1 when you under stress you burn out B1 when you go through uh when you eat sugar you lose B1 when you drink alcohol okay so the point is that sunflower seeds have lots of B1 and nutritional yeast all right now we get the chromium chromium is another good one for uh lowering blood sugar issues and also improving insulin resistance uh broccoli has a ton of chromium and so does nutritional yeast so chromium is a trace mineral now as you notice the thing about nutritional yeast it has like all these amazing B vitamins but it also has all these amazing trace minerals including amino acids as well so nutritional yeast hands down is like one of the greatest things that you can consume it it because it gets in your teeth and everything but um but maybe you can mix with some almond butter okay all right so go ahead and make note of these apply this and uh share your uh comments below thanks for watching	Success
What is the Nervous System? Explained By Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S209tiroQic	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I want to talk about the nervous system it system in the body and there communication systems we have the nervous system and then over here we have the hormone system and the difference is that the communications travel through the nerves with the nervous system and their electrical impulses and then the endocrine system uses hormones as its communication particles and they travel through the blood okay so let two main parts parts of the nervous system we nervous system now not endocrine system we have the peripheral nervous system which is outside the central nervous system so we have a central nervous system which is the brain and the spinal cord and then we have everything outside those are the two main systems so central nervous system controls and coordinates every single body function and and um it does it through pre-program um like like almost like genetic blueprints that have messages that that send signals to keep the body in a survival mode um so everything works and then the peripheral nervous system has two parts one is the somatic which somatic means body um in Latin but the somatic nervous system controls all the muscles okay so skeletal muscles and smooth muscles so that have another part of the peripheral nervous system called the autonomic nervous system this is what I want to spend a little bit more time on autonomic is is a term a Greek term for independent because it this can work independent of this over here it has its own kind of microchips or mini brains uh because it can run uh from those things called ganglia you remember the ganglia studying about that those are like mini little ner centers that are down your spinal column and you have plexuses of nerves which are like ganglia in the abdomen too like the solar plexus and all these different um wiring sort of speak um it think about it there wires that come out of the brain and they either go to the muscles or they go to the autonomic nervous system which controls and coordinates glands and organs and the sympathetic nervous system is kind of like the on switch so it activates things and then you have the parasympathetic means it an off switch and the parasympathetic controls more rest and digestion and the sympathetic is more the flight or fight um I guess a couple little background pieces of information would be to describe it like let you did not have your body adapting to that sudden shift and change in gravity running up the blood wouldn your brain because when you run it fast all the blood feet and you will pass out so in order for the body to adapt to that change in elevation and stress the sympathetic nervous system kicks in there pumps adrenaline and pushes the blood up to the brain and it does it on a gradient so if the person has weak sympathetics they won stress they won body for a stressful State and that what the sympathetic nervous system does so the sympathetic nervous system is um if you can Envision being chased by a tiger you would have to increase blood flow to the muscles uh you have to increase brain acuteness and awareness you release dump a lot of sugars for the muscles to use this fuel because you not going to have time to burn fat so all those reactions of adapting the body to either uh running away or fighting would be the sympathetic nervous system now the opposing system would be the parasympathetic so once you run up to the the top of the the stairs your blood pressure has to return and come down so this is the recovery system the parasympathetic kicks in when you so that works hard at calming you down the parasympathetic is where you burn all the fat when you a calming rest and then that digest when you are in a sympathetic mode the the uh the parasympathetic kind of shuts down and to that degree um it affects it kind of blocks your reproductive system because when you chased by a tiger you don a baby or something you don get pregnant um but when you being chased by a tiger you also um don when you kick in the sympathetic digestion shuts off reproductive shuts off sleeping shuts off but when you in parasympathetic everything is chilled out you recovering your body is adapting to things so the whole goal of this system is to maintain something called homeostasis now what is homeostasis that is the a body to some type of environmental situation or change or stress so the inside of your body is adapting to the outside to maintain equilibrium okay to a constant level so in the body there these certain conditions that our body kind of stays in equilibrium like let say temperature temperature is 98.6 the pH of your blood is 7.34 or 7.3 34 one of the two um the pH of your urine should be 6.0 uh the blood pressure should be 120 over 80 the pulse rate should be 72 these are all equilibrium things that your body is trying to maintain your blood glucose should be 100 exactly well the automic nervous system keeps all these adapting so if you actually go outside and you actually get cold your body heats up if you upstairs your blood pressure will adapt and then the parasympathetic will keep bringing it down to that equilibrium so we get all these body functions that the autonomic nervous system controls um and it controls it not necessarily in an on switch or an off switch but more like a dimmer switch so there approaches to this system and this system so let a mile jog well this thing might be kicked in but you have this one at the same time so they dimmer switches that kind of on a gradient this will increase and this will increase depending on the level of effort or change that occurs so let if you see your child your baby underneath a car it you baby but if you just see like a little roach that you want to kill we might have like 10% sympathetic and mostly parasympathetic so really it switch is kind of like a gradient approach and then there system right here which is the digestive system so that the other the third autonomic nervous system uh section enic which is digestion and this has just as many neurons and nerve nerves nerve endings as you would have in your spinal column and so this system is amazing because it um it can work on its own and it controls like a mesh around the colon to actually allow it to pump it peristalsis or helping it become mobile along the 30 31 ft of intestine so this is what that system um actually does so that the basics of the different systems and then in the next video I you how we measure the autonomic nervous system	Success
Adrenal Fatigue at Menopause Explained By Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4uojf4y72Q	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey Dr Burke here in this short video we relationship between adrenal fatigue and menopause um if you late 40s or you just got into 50s and usually the magic um age is 52 but it can happen earlier or later uh you may find that you have a lot of changes internally in your body because during menopause what happens we have a transition of the ovaries shutting down and not working as much they never completely turn off but they kind of go down and then the adrenal gland actually acts as a backup because it produces very similar hormones but if the adrenal gland is tired or weak or fatigued going into the menopause you notice several things happening to your body number one more belly fat number two a loss of collagen that that the the kind of the tone of the skin you might just feel like you faster uh your mood will be affected why because all of those hormones are strain like serotonin the anti-anxiety uh hormones that are in the adrenal and um then you have your sleep patterns are off too not to mention hot flashes night sweats and all those other fun things but these are some of the things that happen and if you menopausal symptoms it your adrenal gland is the weak link and it ovaries so there are some things you can do um I like to support the gland I use the product uh it fatigue formula I recommend taking one of these before bed it has recovery nutrients it helps to support the gland itself so it can build up the strength of that gland and help reduce some of these symptoms so that would be um kind of the basics of what happens at menopause and the culprit it adrenal that is the problem uh in under most most situations with menopause so I will see you in the next video	Success

Vitamin D Suppresses the Cytokine Storm	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGfWo8q2i-k	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let actually do for something called the cytokine storm if you that is it the majority of people who have coveted 19. but realize that it kill someone if their immune system is malfunctioning there is a really interesting study i put the link down below it wasn peer-reviewed yet but it was from the northwestern university comparing two groups of countries so what they did is it compared the countries with the highest mortality rate which means the highest rate of dying from kobe 19 to the countries with the lowest mortality rate which had the least effect on someone life and then they looked at their vitamin d status and they found a really good correlation between the higher mortality group and the lowest amount of vitamin d versus the lowest mortality rate and the highest amount of vitamin d but not only that they found a strong correlation between vitamin d and the cytokine storm in other words people that had the most vitamin d did not have the cytokine storm now why is that because vitamin d is a immune modulator it controls the amount of inflammation within the immune system and it has a lot of other functions as well but what i want to talk about is the mechanism of this cytokine storm now what is a cytokine a cytokine is a signaling protein that can do several things it can increase the number of white blood cells it can also cause inflammation it can also suppress inflammation and it can also stimulate something called angiogenesis which is basically the growth of new blood vessels so just as your immune system has many different strategies in fighting off the invaders like pathogens these pathogens like viruses also have strategies to survive and counter the attacks so this is my picture of a cytokine storm and that basically is a situation where you have this hyper inflammatory reaction going on creating a lot of damage to the body now there two parts of the immune system we have one part which is the innate which is more of a general attack you have certain players or certain white blood cells that do a general attack it very specific but over here we have something called the adapted or acquired immune system which is all about being very specific in their attack the hiv virus has its strategy of knocking out called the t helper cell which is like the the quarterback or the general that orchestrating the entire immune system recruiting different players uh generating different weapons to attack these pathogens so if hiv can knock this out then you don that fact it immunodeficiency syndrome which basically means you are deficient in your immune system now other viruses will attack the t regulatory cells and the t regulatory cells are the t suppressor cells that put out the fire in the cytokine storm one of the jobs is to lower inflammation and prevent autoimmunity which there inflammation so viruses can destroy this cell also low vitamin d can cause this to not work and allow this to work so in other words here you have this imbalance you don brake pad anymore it and you can that creates an overreaction of the immune system now there interesting strategy that these viruses and bacterias have and that is called super antigen now an antigen is a part or piece of a pathogen that your immune system is reacting to that is foreign and creating damage okay so it pathogen and of course your immune system once it sees that thing it going to attack it so what our immune system will do sometimes is take a piece of that to recognize the signature of that pathogen so it knows what to eliminate or attack so it antigen that to your immune system so your immune system can attack and destroy but the problem is with a super antigen it now remember i talked about part of the immune system is non-specific or general well the other system called the acquired or adaptive is no longer specific in other words these special forces that are trained to kill very specific thing are now killing everything so you can imagine you took this high-powered machine gun with a shotgun all together and you completely annihilated your house by shooting everything but not necessarily the thief so the problem with super antigens is the collateral damage that that creates within your own immune system so these antigens are binding to everything and so everyone has a little red x on their back and we massive amount of cytokines all over the place you see in a normal immune response you have the antigen that is presented and then you have the immune attack we really only activate a very small part of your immune system it between point zero zero zero one two point zero zero one percent of your t cells but with the super antigen situation you 20 of your t cells and some circumstances you them so you can imagine the massive inflammation from the situation all coming from a strategy that a virus has virus wants to stay alive so it going to trick your immune system in certain ways so what with all this inflammation you to develop a rash a fever you potentially no longer going to have a localized infection it it can get very severe to the point where it can put a person in a coma or kill them as in coven 19 but realize vitamin d does help suppress cytokines and also realize that if your immune system is healthy you don to worry about anything so the message of this video is just to emphasize the importance of vitamin d not just in suppressing cytokines but literally saving someone shocked to find out that no one talking about vitamin d in the news with coven 19.

Quick Way to Know if You Have Brain Damage	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2hj98vV9pQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I determine if you have brain damage or not now this is what I don do I don friends or your family members and tell them hey I just saw a video of dr. Burks and I think you have brain damage okay don for them what you have to realize is pretty much everyone acquires some degree of damage in their brain as they age and that has to do with a lack of fuel in your neurons in one study it was shown that an average person loses about 30 percent of their brain cells as they get older into their 80s and even 90s and so that what I it very gradually like you forwards and you where you put your keys that type of thing that is simply a situation where your neurons are starving of fuel and the symptoms would be loss of memory loss of clarity loss of focus and attention and that comes from doing a high carbohydrate diet because over time your body is going to resist the carbohydrates it insulin resistance and now the glucose can starve the good thing about this is that neurons actually prefer a different type of fuel not glucose but ketones in fact if given the choice between glucose and ketones the brain will always choose ketones as their preferred fuel so if your neurons are starving for a glucose just feed them ketones so now here is the experiment I would like you to do simply get on the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting I put a link down below and within one to two weeks notice your cognitive improvements are you sharper are you more focused is memory better and what about you mood has it gone up if so then we know there brain or you can try another experiment you can take MCT oil when you take this oil medium chain triglycerides comes from coconuts what you without even going on a ketogenic diet and your brain will absorb those ketones and if there is damage within the brain your cognitive function will start to improve you more attention better memory and even a better mood so if there either one of these then we know there been some damage going on NCT oil basically gives you instant fuel that bypasses the damage that the carbohydrate diet created now one thing that a lot of people realize when they start a ketogenic diet and when they start in them in the fasting is they start feeling better okay with more energy and their cognitive function starts to really improve and definitely their mood increases so obviously they stay on the diet for a long period of time now the cool thing about being on this program is it can even overtime improve the damage of your brain rather than getting a cat scan or MRI of your brain just simply change the fuel source and then evaluate it decide if it something that you want to do long term alright thanks for watching and I put the link down below of how to do the keto diet as well as in a been fasting the correct way thanks for watching with another amazing recipe no brains no sugar totally keto there no care and it absolutely you have to check this out I think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it easy to be keto but is it simple it hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying idiot	Success
Leptin Resistance is Behind a Weakened Immune System	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDuGK00f1dc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey everyone today i have another special guest ivor cummins is here welcome i iver how you doing hey eric great to see you again good seeing you too so uh ivor has been to both of my summits the keto summit and he always has incredible information he cholesterol cardiovascular health and also calcium in the arteries which he is going to be talking about but so so there between um the risk factors for this uh situation that we maybe you wanna mention that or talk about that yeah eric i weeks i from cardiovascular and metabolic and all the usual stuff to this big issue and um partly because i it challenge and tragic one for many people of course we won uh but also because the world out there is so focused on it that right now is probably not the perfect time to be doing my usual stuff because there hunger to know more about this and i very well positioned to decode the science for people so i doing a lot of work on it and yeah as you just said i mean the risk factors for corona it striking hypertension cardiovascular disease copd all the classic signs of insulin resistance or leptin resistance syndrome which is an epidemic in our modern world and we saw that from the china data at the very start i picked up on it way back and i said wow this is hitting the very people that the heart disease hits right it the same people the same metabolic issues fascinating fascinating um you know for those people that don um see you like i think electrical engineer but no it biochemical engineer biochemical yeah which is a completely different uh animal because you have to know chemistry and biology and all this stuff so you can read the research and understand it and pull strings and which is very very interesting so i just want to make that note which is important yeah you do need the expertise now that was my primary degree and then i spent a couple of decades slightly different industries but you never really forget and interestingly in college doing biochemical the biochemistry classes in the in the various years they were the ones that were my most favorites they could because they were fascinating you know we did genetics we did all of the citric acid cycle all metabolism and we actually did a lot of that stuff fascinating but then my my job i didn many years later of course eight years ago when i had poor blood test results i had to go back in and research and answer the questions so it great to go back to it yeah oh that factor for um the colbit you have um uh high blood pressure is a tablet list cardiovascular obesity diabetes insulin resistance i mean that all just comes down to this insulin resistance thing it does exactly and copd as well but that so the orthodoxy or the establishment is seeing these as all these different things but of course you and i know they all go back to the same roots of insulin resistance and maybe a little thing to add as well is leptin resistance so way back at the start of this whole issue i interviewed dr ron rosedale he a genius i think and he to help with their diabetes epidemic and obesity epidemic and he was the guy who actually originally 25 30 years ago he discovered the crucial nature of insulin and measuring insulin and leptin another hormone and he actually worked out originally that of course the atkins diet the keto diet is correct a no-brainer because you keep your insulin and leptin low and you keep your glucose low and that is the best thing for long life and health but he went through with me in a full hour-long podcast how leptin resistance for which is kind of the same as insulin resistant to anyone listening leptin resistance is the kind of core part of a poor immune function and without going into detail he went through how leptin not only when your leptin signaling is disrupted when you leptin signaling being disruptive completely undermines your immune system and all of the processes that cause the issues with this virus and leptin is even actively involved in the immune system it immune response and if you because you insulin resistant leptin cannot do its immune function job correctly so again without going into the weeds it now aren leptin with hunger appetite right yeah so leptin is a fat cell hormone but it excreted and used in many other places but generally leptin is part of your appetite control system and if you eat and your fat cells you know expand the leptin signal tells you long term that you reduces your appetite the tragedy is if you become leptin resistant the system doesn anymore and then the appetite is not controlled so it but also there which is a corner case very interesting that sometimes people who are middle aged particularly females when they actually lose a lot of weight and they lose a lot of fat cells they become low leptin which is very healthy low leptin is healthy but sometimes the lower leptin tends to trigger a little bit of appetite and that and that can make it hard for people who plateau you know they tends to keep the appetite triggered so you just need to learn to understand that and and overcome it but yeah now the things that uh correct or improve insulin resistance they improve the leptin absolutely for the person in the street so to speak the beauty of it is if you want to get into the science that resistance insulin resistance there separation in terms of what you do to stop them happening or what you do to make them worse they now is there any relationship between um the metabolic syndrome issues and uh ace2 inhibitors ah the ace2 inhibitors yeah so dr rosedale actually went through that in some detail a lot of people think that maybe the ace2 inhibitors the drugs are causing maybe the higher susceptibility and what dr rosedale pointed out was that your ace receptors they proteins just because there doesn that you there were studies he quoted so i think that it the drugs for hypertension are causing more ace receptors and bringing in the virus i think what is probably more likely is the kinds of people who are on those drugs they suffer from insulin and leptin resistance right they with hypertension and most hypertension is undiagnosed insulin resistance so the drugs associate the blood pressure drugs associate with worse outcomes but but it i think it diabetics overwhelmingly and people with hypertension and it problems that outcomes and and the challenges wow so when you talk to this uh doctor did he uh mention the susceptibility goes up when you um for um when you have leptin resistance and then the immune system goes down and then the virus could potentially take over is that was that the connection or yeah absolutely that uh leptin resistance like insulin resistance it kind of smell after a while in the smelly room and when your body is subjected to high leptin and high insulin you can your body no longer hears the signals and that he also stressed that the leptin itself is a part of the immune system response a very very direct part and in fact il-6 which they drugs because this issue this virus causes a cytokine storm or it causes your immune system to send out a whole load of attack vehicles right to attack the virus attack cells with the virus but what actually happens that hurts people is your own immune system goes overboard and ends up killing a lot of other cells and basically bringing it down down the sinkhole and ron had a great way of describing it he said your immune system is very powerful but what happens with this virus is your immune system comes out with all these cytokines like machine guns you know shock and awe and firing all over the place and sure they kill cells with the virus and they kill the virus but they kill a lot of other stuff too including the person so leptin he described as a very important part of modulating or controlling that response and when you only does it stop your immune system doing what it should do properly but it also fails to control your immune system from doing what it shouldn so on every side of this leptin resistance sits at the seat yeah off the modern population susceptibility and if we were all insulin sensitive and leptin sensitive at a rough guess we times less impact from this and people might not be aware but worldwide or in europe this virus is looking like it will cause around three times more excess deaths than the 2018 flu season so the 2018 flu season if you look up the all-cause mortality in europe caused around 180 000 extra deaths um in the peak of the winter in 18 in 700 million people in europe so 180 000 currently corona has caused around 230 000 extra deaths so it higher than 18 and the way the curves are going where the deaths are coming down now in nearly all countries it looks like it might be three times worse than 2018 flu so just to put things in perspective that and of course if it was 10 times less bad no one would notice just like in 18. right exactly um when we talk about the cytokine storm we inflammatory uh situation where you have these cytokines which are um the ones we talking about are there community cytokines have several um functions one is a communication signaling the other is a yeah pro and anti-inflammatories when we inflammatory ones that go in there and just create all the damage so your immune system is creating the damage um and i think that um you also have on the innate part of the immune system now i sorry the adaptive you have the t regulatory cells and those t they suppress ourselves they the firemen that can put out the fire but they get weak so sometimes people think it overreacting immune system like it a real strong immune system but actually it they this buffer we don it and then the body just starts to go down from there now is there any relationship because we know that vitamin d obviously suppresses the cytokines and it also improves these t regulatory cells is there any relationship between vitamin d and leptin or there there is and again it could get complicated here but the recent studies from vitamin d are fascinating and actually i think you had a youtube video on one of them the other day with the 780 people the indonesian one yeah yeah yeah so these are incredible because one came out with around 230 people i think from the philippines very interesting but very early and then the indonesian one with 780 people and that was fantastic because when people get older they tend to have lower d so maybe it just that they were older people got worse outcomes but those guys corrected for age statistically and they corrected for sex and corrected for comorbidities or other illnesses so that study was stunning but the long story is there the upshot of it is four studies out on humans on corona and vitamin d and rough and tough if you nanograms which is my rule i like to be at 45 but below 30 is where i people have 10 times the risk of of severe outcome or death from this virus now to put things in perspective for people the who told us that meat might cause cancer based on their studies which showed me was maybe 1.1 times more likely for you to have cancer which is a joke if you two times or double the risk the study is a joke really but this is 10 times and the link to leptin is that the thing about vitamin d is you can be low on vitamin d and it can cause the problems with the immune system like not modulating or controlling it and many other things but the other thing vitamin d is is a master marker because if your leptin are insulin resistant obese with dysfunctional visceral fat low low adiponectin all these things around the metabolic disease that we always talking about that keto fixes well people in that bad state it drives down your d status so interestingly you can certainly push up your d with supplements but some people who are inflamed in that state they really need to fix their diet and get sunshine and fresh air and get healthy because some people the supplements find it very hard to rise their vitamin d but if they start eating the right thing doing the right stuff their vitamin d can rise even if they don so people need to know it there vitamin d in that blood test one of them is not having enough d you know get your supplements in the winter get your sun but the other thing is that d is marker telling you you may have an inflammatory problem so it resistance and stuff we were talking about fascinating you also have the fatter you are the more difficult it is to convert and absorb the vitamin d through the skin so you have that and then you have um i mean for those of you that haven seen this video um they put people in i guess it was three groups and the group that had normal amounts of vitamin d i think the mortality rate was four percent and the one that was uh insufficient of vitamin d the mortality rate was 88 the one that was deficient in vitamin d had a mortality rate what was it 99 i so it it was stunning because you know i i always have enemies on twitter you know the anti-low-carb anti-keto pro-statin crew you know and i arguing with them and it but they came out against me for promoting and explaining and describing these studies and they don they a placebo randomized controlled trial where you give someone more vitamin d and prove that they have better outcomes but in associational studies like i mentioned if the risk ratio or risk multiplier you see is less than two times you know that kind of weak but when it that fulfills the criteria for serious causality yeah and these are powerful studies right oh my gosh it know um this there there and i know there um double-blinded controlled studies clinical trials the whole thing right there and that think we need to have that um but my question is will they be doing that for the vaccine that question i highly doubt it but they should they they somehow they get out of doing that with the vaccine because you want these things safe so yeah and i think the problem with the vaccine it self-censor ourselves i find it difficult to even talk about the science i can talk about statins no problem and cholesterol not being a cause all these controversial things no problem but they environment where if you even talk about safety and vaccines you get accused of being what they say anti-vaxx and the problem is that that one can no longer speak freely and discuss data and unfortunately that happened with these vaccines so my mind is the original vaccines the measles and all those things from years ago were pretty solid as a rock and proven out it ones and my perception is that they getting the due diligence and very careful testing they may be showed it and they boom and it it can be a danger when there worldwide panic even though to be quite honest as i said it like than 2018 so it it shouldn there and i hope people don because there i think a lot of european countries have done mild lockdowns they in the number of fatalities they were overwhelmingly very aged people and people with with medical conditions they there yeah they course don but we have to have a perspective on this and the curves are coming down and a dozen european countries are lifting restrictions and the summer interestingly coronavirus family has been researched for 30 years and there that coronaviruses are highly seasonal and all previous studies have shown coronavirus family to spike in the winter in the northern hemisphere and then to disappear in the summer so we may have really good news if the summer makes this corona behave like others if people the the debt rates are falling the spread happens and there may not be a need for a vaccine at all perhaps i think you fact um i a video on that exact topic um on temperature and humidity and how it actually get better and better um it supposed to think critically as long as it groups of science or whatever scientist um i want to switch gears um a good friend of yours uh did a really great movie recently can you can you tell us a little bit about that yeah that trying to get the message out there so this is super so back to the calcification scan and just a really quick reminder for people so again thinking risk ratios if you have really weird cholesterol you might be 1.3 times more likely to have a problem but it if you have hypertension maybe 1.7 times more likely to have a heart attack in the next 10 years but if you take get a scan a calcium scan cac score it sees the calcium and the inflammation uh caused calcium buildup in the arteries in your heart in a five-minute scan and the amount of that you have that can be a 10 times risk for a heart attack in the next 10 years or even 20 times so this quick 5-minute scan for 100 bucks it tells you the truth tells your risk so what we did in the movie is we got the heroes of the 1991 uh big final in ireland in irish football so there in there and we got them now in their late 50s and we scanned 45 of them and the key thing was that all of them their doctors said they were fine there was no need for any treatments they were all healthy good to go and we scanned them and we picked up 9 out of 45 with super high scores and two or three of them have since had emergency surgery based on the scan result which saved their life and one even had a heart attack just before the surgery but luckily he was okay but we were able to walk in there and find that out and their doctors were shocked you know so really important this scan it crucial and not just for heavyweight people or smokers we slim people who are fat inside and the scan will tell you who but what we did is one guy we picked our hero so a few of the guys took measures to stop their score getting higher over the year and we had great success but i won give away the movie but our hero we followed patty o who back in 91 quite famous in ireland and he said guys what should i do and guess what eric everything we said he should do you would agree with and it involved eliminating refined carbohydrates he had to get rid of the breads the banana breads you know the cereals and he began to eat real food you know meat fish and eggs and real food and he got a blood glucose meter and he was checking himself a few times a day and keeping a log i mean this guy did the work and vitamins and minerals you know magnesium k2 you know fish oils he was taking a full set of those and magnesium potassium i think and at the end of the year we re-scanned them and let story he booked the trend yeah wow in fact we had three cardiologists as part of the movie including william wheatbeller ellie davis and an australian cardio and a british cardiologist who murray and scott know this this is a big disrupter for cardiology and preventative cardiology and what we uh opens up a bright new future of genuine prevention in the coming decades and i think that gonna put a link down below you guys need to check this movie out um i um go ahead oh yeah it movie dot com and uh absolute super if you can put a link but it this whole issue our funder and sponsor his business has been hit really really bad with this virus issue and you know it out if people share it enjoy it download our stream and uh yeah we put a year and a half and yeah it check it out but they lot as well you know it just want to tell you guys what he talking about this uh uh i mean even if you on keto or not on keto you go to the doctor and they say oh you everything and i hear this all the time even though i was like ldl is high of course they the uh the particles they measuring the uh what type of ldl there different kinds and when you the diet you maybe some higher ldl in it but the type is not the the small dense type that can invade the arteries and create inflammatory markers it it floating through the uh the bloodstream and to to know that you know you can get another test that a little bit more in-depth which i think is a good idea um but hands down as far as the indicators are predictive um i guess indicator for cardiovascular actually i think it all mortality if i predictors for all mortality is the cac test right correct me if i fact we saw it yet again in all our 45 people we did blood tests and the only things that gave a hint of the high score high scoring people was low hdl maybe high triglycerides kind of surfaced and hba1c which you probably explained to people before blood sugar but otherwise the ldl the total cholesterol it predicted nothing so we got nine guys with massive scores and your your ldl total that they had you could tell nothing it could be low medium noise so the calcium scan bypasses all those guesswork blood tests and goes straight to do you have disease what is your risk when the body uh is inflamed and that you oxidative damage in the arteries the body eventually calcium and it simple test i had it done and it pick up information it you want it to be zero sometimes it really high sometimes it that score you can get a lot of information it is one of the best predictors of mortality um and so also if you haven know about ivor i because in his youtube channel because i mean he he has studied this stuff like forever and yes he knows pretty much i don who knows more than him about this topic uh the calcium that builds up in the arteries so um learn more about it and um if you have a high score there solutions um but the worst thing is having a high score and not even getting the test and not even knowing about it and then being surprised one day and going why did it end up in the hospital or just dying so it is such a simple cheap test everyone should get it done but you need to know about what it is yeah great no thanks for that eric absolutely and you know so many tragedies vastly higher numbers will die from chronic disease alzheimer disease than our current issue which will pass and like you say people will die and they never had a chance to take action and if you do get a very high score which means you have a very high risk if you intervene and take action with a lot of what you say eric and you know vitamins minerals keto get your sugars down insulin down you take action you can stop that score rising and after a year or so if you it down and stopped it going up that makes you almost as safe as if you got a zero in the first place so a high score is not a sentence a high score just means hey i gotta do all the right stuff fix the causes that drove this progressive disease and then in a year or two come back and you find out ah you know it was going up and up and up and now you know what it and that means you really really safe compared to where you were you know that much i appreciate it and then people are going to really get a lot out of this so thank you thank you eric thanks	Success

What Causes Autoimmune Conditions?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPuavnZFebo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so let an autoimmune condition let me just briefly tell you what an autoimmune condition is it body has created immune cells that are attacking itself and that creates inflammation and inflammation creates a lot of collateral damage and it those free radicals that end up destroying the tissue and the immune cells that are attacking itself are called Auto antibodies and you can have these Auto antibodies to pretty much any tissue in your body you can have them to receptors of cells you can have these immune cells attack pretty much any tissue of the body and so what an autoimmune condition boils down to is this one cell called the th17 cell becoming over active okay excessive amounts of the T it 17 are responsible for autoimmune conditions so now let me just kind of explain what this cell is in your immune system you have a lot of different players and you have different types of T cells and the T stands for thymus because that training and that develops and typically the T helper cells have to do with command control they general that recruits help for infection that generates the weapon tree-like cytokines in the inflammatory process so it with infections so it element when someone HIV virus what that virus does is it targets the T helper cells and it knocks those guys out so you have no more immune system at all well in an autoimmune condition you have an over activation of these cells right here th17 cells one of the functions of these cells is to maintain in the intestinal barrier okay the barrier between microbes pathogens and the inside of the body I capillaries the vascular system so it really the maintaining of that barrier and also to help maintain the microbiome homeostasis so to keep those microbes from invading the inside of the body because if there and these bacteria get across and invade the inside of your body and then you gonna get an immune attack and your body antibodies against those cells if some of those cells are pathogens that good thing but what if those cells are your own cells that would be a bad thing so part of the t-cells are involved in central tolerance which means tolerating itself in other words it differentiating itself from a pathogen it destroying our own tissue this cell helps prevent autoimmune conditions now it also works with the T regulatory cells which has an even greater function of preventing autoimmune diseases and it also has a suppressive function of suppressing autoimmune diseases and suppressing hyper inflammatory condition so anything that it tends to calm that system down so if there through this whole infection the T regulatory cells they suppressor cells go in there and put the fire out and calm down the infection so when this cell doesn should now you movement of bacteria across that intestinal barrier and you get chronic infection and you get a lot of inflammation and that really what disease but now the question is how do these cells become over activated well they don there there infection by some virus or some other microbe there so that could activate cortisol which also weakens this barrier right here and then we also have malnutrition that factor and I now what D is that vitamin D helps this cell directly it can help to bring down this over reaction of this sound and this is why vitamin D even in the 40s was used for rheumatoid arthritis and I like 200,000 to 400,000 international units of vitamin D to put that condition in remission so vitamin D helps to regulate the T helper cells specifically this one that disease if you have an autoimmune condition you should be taking vitamin D and you definitely need to focus in and do research on that area and I have some real interesting links down below so check them out thanks for watching hey well back with another amazing recipe no brains no sugar totally Kido there absolutely no character and it immune system absolutely you have to check this out I think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it simple it we hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating	Success
Vitamin D Toxicity: Is This a Danger?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f4XYmrWIas	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I wanted to touch on vitamin D toxicity because there of taking too much vitamin D when in fact it might not be as scary as you might think this document is by Mayo Clinic and it says this vitamin D is not as toxic as was once thought a historical and up-to-date perspective so this is just a brief history on why some people are still to this day a little bit scared about taking too much vitamin D and the 40 arthritis but did you realize the amount they were using were between two hundred thousand I used two three hundred thousand I use I mean an average person might take six hundred IU thousand IU thousand three hundred thousand and the reason this works is vitamin D really helps the immune system and gets rid of inflammation but then in the fifties they were actually fortifying the dairy products and other products but there been some complaints from parents with children who had some side effects calcification and the kidneys and even some calcification on their heart valves so the fortification of vitamin D and dairy was banned in Europe but not necessarily in America or Canada or I think even in the UK now years later they found out exactly why these specific children had these problems it was because they had a rare genetic disease called Williams syndrome in which case you don vitamin D at all or else you calcification in the valves of the heart as well as kidney stones so if we take out this rare genetic disease there wasn just a lot of benefits so nowadays when you look at vitamin D it always says precaution make sure you don much you could experience a toxic effect now that statement is in all the textbooks it it bit nervous about that but if you go through this article it would take fifty thousand to a hundred thousand IU months two years before vitamin D became toxic now this is a lot more than what people even consider toxic and when we say toxicity we hypercalcemia too much calcium in the blood which could lead to kidney stones however there any evidence that shows that taking vitamin D will lead to kidney stones at all so people end up taking smaller amounts 1,000 to 2,000 IU a period of time well I did another video which I will put a link down below that shows that if you you take a thousand milligrams it could take four months or longer before your deficiency is satisfied to be able to put all the immune conditions into remission it does take large amounts for long periods of time and on top of that if you wanted to decrease the risk of any potential for this really what you do is you actually drink 2.5 litres of fluid every single day and you avoid taking calcium as a supplement and you avoid dairy and that will actually bring the risk for kidney stones way down so you can then have the anti-inflammatory benefits for all the lean conditions and also realize that anything that I say in this video is not meant to replace your medical care check with your doctor before taking any of my advice and before you go check out this video on vitamin D dosage I think you quite interesting	Success
Why Does Saudi Arabia Have Such a Vitamin D Problem?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqywVV5zQOs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so why is it that the country of Saudi Arabia which has so much sun exposure have such a vitamin D problem there is a meta-analysis between 2008 and 2015 that demonstrated a 63.5% of the population having a vitamin D deficiency okay that is crazy high but not only that there was a nineteen point nine percent of the population had a vitamin D insufficiency which is not a full deficiency but they had like a subclinical vitamin D deficiency and if we add those two numbers together we get eighty three point four percent of the population has a big problem with vitamin D this is epidemic their seventh in the world for the rate of getting diabetes and I their fourth in the world at the rate of getting type one diabetes which is an autoimmune disease and by the way 84 percent of type one diabetes in children showed a vitamin D deficiency there huge connection now why are they deficient vitamin D well the obvious thing is they have traditional clothing that blocks the Sun and there probably has some other reasons too because once you get diabetes you other factors too like obesity and the amount of fat on your body that slow things down the amount of pigment in your skin you have age your digestion so there you have to realize is that only 10% of the vitamin D in your body comes from your diet it all of your vitamin D from your diet but just realize that fatty fish cod liver oil have a lot of vitamin D now when you have fatigue you can get depressed it increases your risk for getting diabetes as well as a lot of inflammation especially in the lower back you get aches and pains bone pain if you press uh near your sternum okay which is your breastbone and you have pain or your shin which is in the front part of your lower leg and it hurts that could be because of the vitamin D deficiency high blood pressure is a vitamin D deficiency a weakened immune system so there are many problems that occur when you deficient in vitamin D so if you live in Saudi Arabia and you video I highly recommend you start taking at least 15,000 to 20,000 IU vitamin d3 every single day I would also recommend to go along with that is to take vitamin k2 and for every 10,000 IU of k2 and that your own calculations on that but I think if you start taking vitamin D I think you improvement in these symptoms as well as a major reduction in not only diabetes type 2 but type 1 as well alright thanks for watching hey with another amazing recipe no brains no sugar totally Kido there no care and it builder absolutely you have to check this out I think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it simple it enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating	Success
Don't Turn Off Your Immune System Prematurely	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4n_kRlQ63Q	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey I talk about suppressing the infection cycle is it a good idea or a bad idea let you pre-existing health problems and you start having a fever muscle ache flu-like symptoms a runny nose a cough should you automatically start taking ibuprofen antibiotics some type of medication to suppress these symptoms or not well let really happening internally specifically with viruses the virus first invades the body and its goal is to get inside the cell so it starts to attach to your cell and then it actually gets into the cell and then it opens up it takes the outer part of it and just opens up and releases its RNA or DNA into your cellular machinery and then once it hijacks gets into your cellular machinery it starts to take over the copy machine so it can mass-produce now when it does that your own body doesn have access to that copy machine so as the viral is using machinery it doesn allow your own body to use that machinery so then what happens is as the blueprints are copied they other machinery of your cell to reproduce the actual cell itself so these are the tiny machines that make proteins then when the virus is replicated it can then be released through the cell and that shedding so in this process if the virus is outside the cell it can anything to you once this virus gets in the cell it system to identify it but ourselves have adapted to countering this measure so there can detect the virus and those little proteins will go to the surface of the cell and signal other parts of your immune system that hey there inside the cell and it does it signaling through certain cytokines so it kind is really a communication that is sent out to the immune system and there are different cytokines for different things so you have cytokines that are also pro-inflammatory they make inflammation and others that are anti-inflammatory as well so what the cytokine is going to do it to send a signal out to various parts of your immune system and what be generated from that is a very powerful antiviral cytokine or weapon it the chemical that triggers certain symptoms of a virus infection cough fever muscle ache flu-like symptoms so what you have to realize is that when you have these symptoms it not always the best thing to try to suppress these because you to suppress this interferon and interferon comes from this word interfere because its function is that it interferes with the virus reproducing so it interferon to do its job to decrease the reproduction of viruses if you healthy and you don pre-existing health problems and you not very old the best thing to do is to support the immune system not to suppress it because they found that it going to increase the duration of the infection you infection a lot longer if you try to suppress this mechanism also there even studies that show that taking something to suppress the immune system increases your mortality rate ideally the best thing to do is let your body fight the infection and support the immune system by getting on an eating plan that lowers your carbohydrates that enhances vitamin D zinc and vitamin C these are crucial keeping your stress down because stress will also prolong this infection and as far as the fever goes you want to stay hot take a hot shower wear extra clothes when you going to bed to speed up the process because the fever is generated as an antiviral action to suppress the reproduction of viruses anyway I wanted to bring this up because a lot of people have these symptoms and they automatically try to get rid of them they don happening if you want more information about how to boost the immune system check out this video	Success
Why Does Our Thymus Shrink to Nothing As We Age?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sN5J79L_oY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I gland and why it shrinks down to nothing as you get older it important gland as it relates to your immune system because it is the training center for your immune cells specifically the t-cells which stand for thymus cells and this gland is right underneath your breastbone right on top of the heart not to be confused with your thyroid which is a little bit higher up right here the thyroid and the thymus are completely two different separate glands now when your infant you have this huge thymus gland and the reason why it doesn has to go through practice by being exposed to germs and develop or acquire it part of the immune system that relates to adaptive or acquired immunity so you have to be exposed learn from this experience and develop immunity over time and as you age it starts to decrease in size by the time you 75 years old it fat and they call this thymic involution okay or or thymic atrophy atrophy means it shrinks okay so without that gland working or even being there your risk for infection goes up your risk for getting cancer goes up your risk of getting an autoimmune disease also goes up because one of the key functions of the thymus is to prevent or protect against autoimmune diseases and one of the theories that contributes to this is a decreased amount of antioxidants and then you oxidation which is gonna kill more cells so if that is true which it might be it validates the idea of consuming a good amount of vegetables leafy greens preferably raw throughout your life but the thymus is involved with these t-cells so we have the T killer cells these are antiviral they tumor they kill tumor cells and then we have the T helper cell this cell is like the commander of the entire immune system so the HIV virus for example targets this cell and it takes out the entire immune system so the T helper cell is not necessarily the quarterback of a football team it coach of the football team in which they are helping design the plays coordinating what everyone does to help win the game so you take this guy out and the whole thing kind of goes downhill so that cell does now the T regulatory cell or t suppressor cell is involved with suppressing an overactive immune system so it specifically helps prevent autoimmune diseases so you take this thing out and then your risk factor goes up now when you hit age 65 the diversity of these cells diminishes significantly so basically this all increases your susceptibility to having problems now what that it seems to be when you and healthy the risk factor from dying from this virus go down so significantly that the odds of you dying are very similar to the odds of you dying in a car when you when you go over 65 it kind of goes up so apparently 65 is kind of a key age for your immune system so now the question is what can we do we can control aging we can control our health and other things number one we can start to beef up no pun intended our antioxidants from vegetables that could help us number two keeping the stress lowered stress by itself I talking about sustained stress like cortisol has the ability to shrink the thymus gland as well as your lymphatic glands like the lymph nodes so excessive stress can cause atrophy of your immune system next thing is very very important and I research down below if you have a zinc deficiency one of the symptoms is this your thymus gland actually atrophies so how difficult would it be just to take some zinc on a regular basis very very important for your immune system to maximize and optimize the size of your thymus glands so you can keep this going as much as possible now through your life if you have a tremendous amount of antibodies sitting there to help protect you so it training going for these t-cells like you were when you important to maintain this thymus gland so you can keep your resistance to infection very very high one more thing I want to mention if you are over 65 or even over 75 there support remedy that you could get find this extract now I recommend any brands you to do the research by yourself it get freeze-dried and take a little bit each day that can greatly help support your immune system specifically the thymus gland take a very small amount initially and gradually work up to maybe even be like one capsule per day don take the whole capsule right off because it could wake up the immune system and create a little bit of a reaction but if you take just maybe a half a capsule with food and take it for like a couple weeks and then slowly increase it a little bit more and more I think that can support your immune system alright thanks for watching	Success
Soap or Alcohol: Which is the Better Antiviral?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePuhBMVzp8A	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I have a question what is better as an antiviral using soap to wash your hands or alcohol let this will be a fairly short video so when we compare using soap and alcohol and I there alcohol can definitely help inactivate many different microbes including viruses okay but I only recommend using an alcohol gel if you don because soap is much much more effective simply because a virus has a fat layer as its envelope and soap is a detergent it plant fat and half alkaline salts so soap is an interesting combination between fat soluble and water soluble it works together so you use soap as a detergent to break down grease fats and other things that are even water soluble and so what this soap does is it breaks down the fat layer of the virus so not only does it destroy the virus it also separates it from your hands so in other words your hand also is a fat layer so adding soap can take this sticky virus and allow it to be released from your hands whereas alcohol can alright so that thanks for watching with another amazing recipe no brains no sugar totally Kido there no parent and it builder absolutely you have to check this out I think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it what is it simple it you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating	Success

Keto Constipation Â Dr. Berg Explains Constipation on Keto Diet	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF2DWdBMtLc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys in this video I want to talk about ketosis and constipation now I wish it was uh real cut and dry that it would always be this one thing but it it involve multiple things so I going of go through uh some of the scenarios that that come up most people think it constipation that is absolutely not true um in fact a lot of the fiber that people consume even from vegetables uh it in so adding more will actually constipate you more so if you look at what you did before uh starting this plan and after we want to look at the big changes and we want to evaluate each change and I constipation you had before doing ketosis that situation which involves probotics and a bunch of other stuff um I about after the K ketogenic diet you started getting constipation what do you do what do you look at so we look at um the change in vegetable fibers okay the microbes live on fiber they will get overwhelmed easily if you have not adapted these microbes to this new way of eating so just like keto adaptation you have to look at the adaptation of the microbes that have to evolve and grow to digest all these fibers because if they can fibers you this cruciferous or Cal shake and you going to bloat you that have to change the vegetables that simple to maybe something like um um like just lettuce spinach other types of vegetables romae lettuce something like that uh to get your green so just definitely look at that other people have an issue with certain types of cruciferous like myself I can broccoli it tears me up it will constipate me uh I can do lots of cabbage other people cannot do cabbage they can do broccoli so you have to test it out I also recommend fermented vegetables simply because those are much easier to break down and uh pickles are good sauerkraut kimchi very very good um okay so we have that and then we also have you know just the fat that you in most cases those two uh types of macros are easier to digest than uh the vegetable carbohydrates believe it or not but it could be that you too much fat that gallbladder and that is backing you up so if you look at just the whole digestive system you have the ability to digest fats proteins carbohydrates or or even fiber and just you want to just check each one of those so so things to adjust are the vegetable the type of vegetable uh maybe too much fat and the other thing is that um when you start a ketogenic diet you will sometimes lose a lot of water weight in the process lose a lot of electrolytes so that always like to add that back in there I highly recommend the electrolyte powder that I use because it has 1,000 Mig of pottassium it has magnesium it has all the electrolytes and trace minerals no sugar um that usually will help the elimination greatly so even potassium in general is the electrolyte to help um with muscle cramps and colon uh cramping or uh stagnant colon so uh when you have more potassium it helps facilitate elimination as well as magnesium those two are electrolytes that are really important in lumination on a very rare occasion I may have the person drink more water but typically that rare that it eating drinking no water you know that could be a situation but it the other thing is that if you too many nuts or even some seeds which it typically if you you Inhibitors which means that that to stop your digestion right there that could be causing the constipation so an experiment would be to germinate the nuts soak them overnight dry them out in the oven under lower temperatures and then consume them and you may find that that solves the whole problem the other thing is just to cut out the nuts for a couple days and see if that gets rid of the constipation because that could block and it also has insoluble fibers so you got the combination of enzyme Inhibitors and then you just can enzyme Inhibitors um and then um as far as dairy goes some quite a few people are have allergies to milk sugar lactose okay so if that you this cheese that you to look at that as well so just kind of experiment if you have some Dairy and you get gas or bloating then we need to eliminate that at this time there are types of dairy that are low on lactose for example lactose free um cheese uh lactose usually cheese has very low amounts of lactose because the microbes consume that sugar and then they they basically you get more of a protein than you would get if you had actual milk or yogurt uh caseine is the protein in da which um that cheeses and it cheeses it you know if you that protein that could back PE people up as well back you up so you might want to try uh try goats cheese or sheep cheese which people can digest that much better than actually uh cheese from cows so you might want to try that as well so these are just things to look at in your um search to find a solution for constipation put your comments below hi guys Hey listen I created a a pretty amazing evaluation quiz down below that actually analyzes your symptoms to find the cause the root cause of all of your symptoms the most likely

Insulin & Lean Muscle Mass Â Insulin Resistance and Muscle Gain Connection Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvZ6K5ueNI4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hi guys in this video I going to talk about insulin and lean muscle mass now some people are trying to build more muscle mass and they it and this is why and I show you help you understand what going on at the cellular level this is a muscle cell right here and there several key pieces of the puzzle that we takes insulin to act as a key to unlock the door of the cells to allow the amino acids to go into the cell and convert amino acids to skeletal muscle protein so we need insulin to make Muscle protein that is true okay the problem is that most people don insulin resistance is when you have insulin resistance which is a pre-diabetic state or you type two you have a situation where you have lots of insulin but it not working in the body so you basically have a deficiency of insulin with insulin resistance okay so you don unlocking of any door thereby thereby starving off the amino acids from the cell so this idea that oh I need more insulin so I going to have more carbs to allow more amino acids to go in there all you going to do is you resistance and you these amino acids from going in the cell and being and being converted into muscle tissue now here you want to know um it only your body only needs a very small amount of sugar in the system small amount of sugar and a in a moderate amount of insulin which basically is 100 milligrams per deciliter of insulin and what does that mean that and a half of blood that is so small an average person has 21 teaspoons of sugar every single day so we need a very very small of carbs so when you do carbal loading you increase a lot of sugar here you insulin in insulin okay so we need some insulin but we don don sugar at all we don just uh what we want to do is we want to look at these other factors you can actually have normal insulin without having any carbs okay and just your body can make sugar your body can make normal insulin if it doesn much sugar so it also takes exercise to stimulate a hormone called growth hormone that then will make the amino acids convert to muscle protein as well so we need this hormone called growth hormone that triggers this process so we need normal insulin growth hormone we need a trigger to make this happen so if you want to build muscle mass you have to do something you have to work your body so growth hormone is triggered by hardcore exercise high-intensity exercise um full body compound resistant training with lots of rest if you overtrain you the recovery because exercise basically breaks down the muscle and it recovery that actually builds the muscle through growth hormone but you got to you got to stimulate the muscle and then you have to let it heal through the sleep that if you don not going to build muscle more sleep more muscle mass you need moderate amount of protein if you do higher amounts of protein like lots of protein you can actually jam up the liver and you can also trigger insulin that will create insulin resistance so you need a little bit you don high quality fishes very high quality amino acids some people do whey protein I it fats in it that you also need to buffer some of the insulin response what triggers insulin a lot more than other proteins is lowfat whey protein it lowfat and it will Spike insulin so if you fat to it maybe coconut oil or something like that so we also um we need sodium and potassium the pump the window the door that this key unlocks is called the sodium potassium pump so you have these minerals that exchange that allow this little transport of protein to go through and also V vitamins and minerals and glucose but we need this pump so that means that if you won not consuming enough potassium you need way more potassium than sodium sodium is tend to t you you probably need like a half a teaspoon of sodium per day but you need 4700 milligrams of potassium every day to get your normal requirement that you can take it as a supplement but the supplements come in like 99 milligram you need 4700 so get you can get it in a powder or electrolyte blend but the point is that you need these two minerals to allow amino acids to go in the cell because that requires the pump to be activated and work correctly so just sometimes by fixing this ratio of minerals you can get more lean body mass because you sodium potassium actually also will fix insulin uh resistance as well right so I just wanted to kind of break down this problem the little pieces to see where maybe you might need to strengthen an area versus another area put your comments below thanks for watching press it forget it forget it I done press the Subscribe button and I will keep you updated on the future events	Success

Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTm7opfgpA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hi guys recently I got a question what is c-reactive protein so I a little video on that and exactly what to do about it what causes it it the blood so it to see how much inflammation is in the body through the blood okay it obviously a protein that indicates that so it disease in vascular disease then cholesterol way better because inflammation is a better indicator of the whole process okay so that is now what what do you do to actually get it under control well you want to ask yourself why is it there in the first place why do you have inflammation in your in your body and your arteries well the most important things were number seven number eight down here and that protein and grains can raise that so you want to get the grains of the diet and then insulin of course you probably already know that but we have to lower insulin I you don the sugar and that the smacking you have to get down into control because that is the biggest inflammatory thing that that so but also nutrition wise vitamin C vitamin C will lower C reactive protein here you want to get your vitamin C from your vegetables like seven to ten cups that the ideal scene that provides you enough vitamin C to drop this the people that have a lot of inflammation don enough vegetables and they lot of like the wrong type of omega-3 oils okay so that now what do we do about it okay I going to first cover some of the nutrient things and then some nutrient things that are even more important number one vitamin C you want to get your vitamin C from your vegetables okay this will lower C reactive protein most people do not consume even close the amount of vitamin C they need from vegetables so you need like at least seven cups minimally ideally ten so that and vegetable each day you want to get used to doing that we because if you think about it you can ask yourself why do you have information in the first place you know there something that is not right in your body and it arteries curcumin is a turmeric turmeric that spice that you can consume you can get in a powder or a supplement or use it on your food okay so that powerful way to lower c-reactive protein and then stinging nettle root that another plant that you can get in a supplement and you can actually use it to do a lot of things but it the most powerful anti-inflammatories that I know vitamin k2 that will also help lower that that also removes calcium into the arteries it cleans out the arteries of plaquing and then fish oil is a high quality fish oil if you going to get a fish oil don from the drugstore go into the health of store and get something higher quality because a lot of times that is rancid but a good cod liver oil is omega-3 is anti-inflammatory okay coenzyme q-10 is also something you can take to lower c-reactive protein and then lowering gluten from the wheat all the breads pasta cereal crackers that has gluten that raise that and lastly most importantly is lower insulin cut the sugar out of the diet cut out the frequent stacking that will lower that and that the biggest reason why people have high c-reactive protein in the first place that arteries alright thanks for watching you I thank you for your amazing feedback that you guys are giving me it mind-blowing the success is the winds I created a link down below so you can actually type out your full success story and if you have a before and after with weight loss that would be awesome and if you don have a success with weight but other things just put an image of yourself and your personal success story and I would love to read it and also share it with others so I want to just thank you in advance for doing that but there link down below fill it out I can to read it	Success

Is it Safe to Take 10,000 IUs of Vitamin D3?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjJdzHIwDDU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	one thing i want to talk about is the duration of how long to take vitamin d as well as the dosage there confusion most people are taking between 600 ius to a thousand i use sometimes 2 000 i use and they think that that one thing you need to realize is that about 75 percent of the population on planet earth are deficient in vitamin d and vitamin d is so important in fact it important fat soluble vitamin especially for the immune system based on some pretty credible studies which i and i only listed three i you quite a few of them in the first study the group took a thousand to two thousand ius of vitamin d once to twice per week for one month and did not increase their vitamin d levels at all second study took a thousand to two thousand ius and it took four months to elevate their vitamin d and in the third study it took three months to achieve just the normal level of vitamin d by taking 1600 ius of vitamin d and i just had a call from a lady on my live show who was taking 50 000 ius of vitamin d for weeks and it did not even increase her levels so the question is how could you be that deficient if you so much vitamin d the first thing to know is that it takes a lot longer than you think to fix a vitamin d deficiency it could take months the second thing to know is that there are various things that prevent the absorption of vitamin d one is your gut if your gut has damaged you vitamin d too well also your age greatly influences your ability to absorb vitamin d not just from dietary sources but from the sun the color of your skin also influences your ability to absorb vitamin d in other words if the skin is darker it could take three times as much sun to penetrate the skin and then there the more subcutaneous fat you have in your body the less you d and then there you and you your face to the sun you your body to the sun which it would take you hours and hours and hours to even achieve a small amount of vitamin d and then you have the location where you live the latitude the connection between where you live in the sun if you live in the northern hemisphere which if we look at united states is just above la and we look at the months between november and march the amount of vitamin d you pretty much insignificant and then we have metabolic issues let you have arthritis you have high blood pressure cardiovascular disease guess what the requirements for vitamin d go way way up and then of course we have the season if it trying to get sun the odds of you getting enough vitamin d are very very slim and then lastly there factor involved called polymorphism where there is a variant or an alteration in your genes which don absorb vitamin d very well and a lot of people have this and they don could be the reason why they can more that i forgot to mention if you have a chronic infection see the viruses that invade the body downgrade your vitamin d receptor so if you have an infection whether it in the lung in the sinuses or in your gut the microbes specifically viruses have a strategy of blocking the absorption of vitamin d they block the receptor so you can absorb it it and the white blood cells that are fighting the virus need vitamin d desperately so they going to suck up that last little bit of vitamin d that you have so as you can see there factors involved with the absorption of vitamin d how much vitamin d would i recommend 10 000 i use per day as a maintenance and i mentioned this plus if there autoimmune issue involved and you much higher amounts of vitamin d with magnesium b6 and zinc and there things that you can do if you vitamin d is toxic which is not you thousand ius of vitamin d for months and months or years to create the complications and the biggest complication from vitamin d toxicity is hypercalcemia that because that could lead to kidney stones one way to even minimize the risk for that would be to drink 2.5 liters of water per day that way you avoid a super concentration of calcium in the kidney so there won the kidney another way is just to avoid calcium and supplements as well as cheese that way there calcium to go into the kidney and form as a kidney stone all right guys thanks for watching hey we recipe no grains no sugar totally keto there not karen and it builder absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it but is it simple it hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating it	Success

Your Immune System is a Highly Trained Military	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QguprEZvK0Y	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today I important topic and that is your own immune system you may not realize this but your immune system is the most kick-ass military that ever was to help you understand the immune system we gonna compare it to the US military and to do that I guest and his name is commander Dave Overcash he years he service included over 300 landings on aircraft carriers five deployments to the Middle East overseas tours in Hawaii Japan and South Korea and serviced at the Pentagon Dave thanks for coming on thank you dr. Berg it forward to our discussion so what I gonna do is I as simple as possible it because it me just attempt to do that what is the immune system the immune system is your defense system it you you have various barriers you have your skin the outside and you also have the barrier of your internal skin in fact the internal skin of your body is quite large in fact it covers 400 square meters that courts so it surface area and you have billions of immune cells just beneath the surface guarding that wall waiting for an invader or a pathogen viruses bacteria so that would be a front line of defense so Dave give me a comparison of that to what the military has the formal military term for that would be the four line of troops or the forward edge of the battle space there trained but not necessarily you know very specialized troops but very large numbers of them in mechanized units I might be a term some of your folks would be familiar with but you your general troops that are gonna be right up along the front that are gonna be able to detect any movement in your adversaries and be able to be the first line of defense against whatever comes against them so this would also compare to something you would see at the airport you have metal detectors you have all sorts of screening devices to weed out those bad actors or people that potentially could carry a bomb on a plane when I was in practice that I would do seminars in governmental agencies so I bought online these those little credit card knifes right as a box cutter I thought they really cool they actually fold up the credit card so uh you know where this is going I basically bought one put in my wall and I forgot about it and I actually somehow took a flight and that wasn week it was in my wallet I went to do one of my seminars had the governmental agency in DC and so as I went through security I just remembered as he was going in that I had that in my wallet and my heart started to pound and all of a sudden but the little red light went off they opened up the wallet and found this credit card knife and they called I don something they call people to shut down the entire building and they pointed to me and they put me on the wall put me in handcuffs and I said no no no you can have it you can write so they took me to a room to wait for the FBI to come they wanted to check me out just to make sure so I seminar what unfortunately there people and they leave they couldn was frozen so I had to wait for some hours and so I and there to sit there just guarding me and it was apparently a room that they had some food in it and there was a cake and they just couldn to speak up it just wasn to talk about you know car bhai so I kind of quickly so then the middle of the FBI came and they just they said what it was cool and I got in so they go yeah this is kind of cool and so they escorted me to the car and everyone was watching and I had to secure this weapon in the car so I can go back and do my seminar presentation so this is another example how the immune system would work it scanning for pathogens things that are not itself and a very important part of immune system is to differentiate between the good guys and the bad guys so the main players on the front line of defense are the phagocytes okay these are cells that eat bacteria and viruses and the top professional phagocyte is called a macrophage macrophage means big cell that eats it a garbage disposal it eats up debris but if there will go in there and take it down and if there the fort while it recruits back up so this part of the immune system is called the innate which is part of the immune system that doesn specialists you this these are general soldiers that have a nonspecific defense mechanism so they can handle little stuff but when things get too crazy your body recruits more specialists from this system right here this is called the adaptive immune system or the acquired so then we have the neutrophil now when you get an infection and you have mucus and pus 70% of that is made out of neutrophils okay so neutrophils have three weapons they can eat microbes but they also control chemicals as well as a net over the microbes and so the chemicals of the use are hydrogen peroxide the active ingredient in Bleach so they use bleach to kill these microbes as after they pulled them in what military is there are certain types of chemical warfare that they use so Dave why don yeah there sure is there biological weapons that they effective and neutralizing an adversary everything related to a chemical kind of attack slows you down and has a an inordinate impact on you compared to normal conventional weapons I remember when I went to basic training that was in 1983 I was in the military the army reserved for five years I was a medic we had to go through this gas chamber and of course they did not give us really toxic chemicals but they exposed us to tear gas and that was a major thing for a lot of people including myself I can even imagine being exposed to something even stronger than that because that was pretty strong so the neutrophil will also throw a net like spider-man on the pathogen with chemicals to dissolve it you know your your example they of like wrapping up and then adding chemicals what it reminds me of is is indirect fires that are used in the military where a let are on the ground and they need to call in artillery support or close air support what they might do is term that that know they see where that bomb lands they where that show lands and then they adjust that fire and then when they get it on to exactly where they want it they the available indirect fires and and then yeah they the adversary that way so we have the macrophage the neutrophil these are both phagocytes then we have something over here called the natural killer cell so one of the things that this cell does is it releases something called interferon interferon comes from the word interfere because the function of interferon interferes with viral reproduction so it stops the production of viruses which is the virus weapon so it slows down the production of the enemy the leadership of the and military realized we have to destroy their means of replicating their capabilities and so the United States ate their force in World War two based in England went after the entire German industrial military-industrial complex they bombed every factory you could possibly imagine destroying plants that produce tanks plants have produced artillery pieces the plants have produced ball bearings anything that would produce a mechanized piece of equipment so the idea was wow we can enough for this equipment fast enough so if we can prevent them from producing any more at least there number of things that we have to destroy instead of an infinite all right we just talked about the innate immune system now let system now the adaptive immune system is acquired in other words it learns from experience in order for that part of the immune system to work correctly you need to expose it to a pathogen or a germ so if someone lives in a sterilized environment they never develop their immune system so it important understand that your immune system grows and becomes stronger through training going through an infection overcoming it and now having that memory of it so it next time Dave give me an example how important training is in the military you know our operations manuals people say are written in blood right so all the mistakes that previous folks used and either died or or crashed aircraft the lessons learned from those things are then written in your operations manual so you don mistake twice there there and they came to pass in the Vietnam War there were three major aircraft carrier fires hundreds of men were killed in fires that start that on those aircraft carriers they had a very difficult and stopping the fires once they began because of all those things that are on the flight deck not everyone on the aircraft carrier was trained at the time to fight fires and so they instituted a program where every single person that goes on to a ship any ship has to go through significant firefighting experience because they found that the initial wave of firefighters were killed in trying to fight these fires and then there wasn take out those fires once they began so yeah if you don to continue having similar accidents over time so this part of the museum are more specialists they Special Forces they actually have very specific actions that they are assigned to these guys are more general these guys are more targeted [Music] [Music] give us some examples of the different units or special forces that you have in the military a lot of times we can match the pure numbers that maybe the adversary that we go against has but we need to have better training and so we have a lot of Special Forces or Special Operations Forces in the military the Navy SEALs Delta Force you know what we found is that like I think I can think of a couple examples we what we found that even if our adversary say purchases a very excellent piece of equipment we could beat that adversary with a lesser capability if we have trained harder mmm and and that so afraid of a North Korean pilot with a great piece of equipment because he doesn because their economy so poor they don have the resources to be able to train a lot and so he may be up there and a great piece of equipment but he really doesn proficient at ador or even say the Iranian Navy purchases a Russian submarine that Russian submarine crew highly trained operating a Russian piece of equipment the Iranians are gonna be as good at it so we found that that training that exposure the more realistic the training the better one one more example I give you is that in the Marines when they have target practice they don automated targets they actually have their the Marines will go behind a dirt berm and I believe they still do this and pull the targets up and down so that they can hear the bullets going overhead while the other Marines are conducting target practice that acclimates them were to an environment where they might be in battle which makes them more likely to be able to succeed when they are in that kind of environment so these specialized immune cells they t-cells stands for thymus basically get their training in the thymus gland which is not the thyroid sounds similar and it actually located lower than the thyroid so the thyroids here thymus is right above the heart and what is only 30% of those t-cells make it through this training the rest die off so they you you get older it starts shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and stress will shrink it a vitamin D deficiency will cause a shrinkage of the thymus gland so nutrition is very very important keeping your thymus very strong in reality these pathogens target different weaknesses within your immune system so if you have a very strong immune system even though it might not be very large it could handle a huge invasion of viruses or pathogens we have a lot of special forces or special operations forces in the military some examples would be the Navy SEALs maybe Green Berets Delta Force US Army Rangers the Air Force has a group called the pair rescue men or PJs there that they the most specialized forces that we have for very specific target sets one point I want to make is this when someone gets an infection they have a cough or runny nose a fever some type of indicator that there body the worst thing to do is to stop that infection to suppress those symptoms because what is you t-cells you you try to suppress the immune system the duration of infection goes longer and longer so they have to work harder and harder so it to enhance the immune system with diet nutrition keeping your stress low than it is to quickly try to shut down those symptoms all right so we talked about the three players under the innate there within the adaptive immune system first one is the killer t-cell now what these guys do is they have a chemical called perform which punches a hole through the cell and then they release a chemical that causes the cell to commit suicide for the greater good of the body so these cells that die for the greater good to kill out that virus are are considered like hero cells Ujima where there were a lot of Marines that would jump on grenades that that landed near them and they they wanted to protect their friends and a lot of examples also with with folks that are in the Medal of Honor which is the highest medal of valor that awarded in the military where they wounded they believe that but they not going to make it and so they would do something that was extraordinary or out of the ordinary where they would go off by themselves to create some kind of a diversion that would allow the troops a left behind to exploit you know the weakness that was made by that movement but they knew that they were gonna die alright the next player is the T helper cell so this cell is a very important self there the entire battle going on so it to recruit backup it determine what players are involved what part of your military is gonna be used at what volume what types of weapon tree Dave give me an example of what you have in the military that compares to that oh absolutely that commander at any level give some general direction about how he wants it done and how often those things are going to happen you have to have somebody at the top that movement and kind of sees the big picture now one thing I want to mention about the tea house CEL is that viruses have strategies to invade and take over the body and our body has strategy is to kind of go back and forth so we have this battle back and forth and if we take the HIV virus its strategy is to take down the T helper cell if it succeeds in doing that because your immune system is weak the entire immune system won work and that immunodeficiency disease [Music] so viruses are very intelligent they gonna take down like the key player involved in this battle now they something in the military that is somewhat similar an individual at the top is as the center of gravity the desert storm it was Saddam Hussein or Iraqi Freedom Saddam Hussein and even when we attacked Afghanistan Osama bin Laden so we the head and believing that if we take out the head of the organization then the rest of the body or the rest of the country will fall into disarray and it will there will be a better use of our resources and make it easier for us to go in and the key to all of it is being undetected because once an adversary knows what you build up their defenses and they can counter whatever it is that you trying to do I have a couple examples of some really damaging spies that we had over our time one her name was Ana Montes she was a spy for Cuba and the Defense Intelligence Agency we we found that she did some amazing damage by her time you know right in the middle of all the greatest intelligence that we had about Cuba during the Cold War and then another one being Aldrich Ames who was a KGB spy in the CIA for longest time we had no idea and he was he did some extremely the damage from his passing of information that he was able to get undetected was was really significant now one strategy that these viruses have is they have the ability to go inside the cell and turn off your vitamin D receptor this means that you can absorb any more vitamin D apparently they know the vitamin D is crucial for your immune system it is involved in every single level and if you don enough vitamin D then you can what an inflammatory condition that control it that this Cove in 1917 system and the enemy the virus and what their strategies are so you can actually overcome it so since we strategy there has been a person in history sunsoo that was a military strategist and he wrote a book called the art of war and I happened to find a book that was translated from original Mandarin Chinese this guy who was in the Vietnam War got very interested in this book he spent six years learning Mandarin Chinese and then translated word-for-word the entire text the original translation of the title of Sun Tzu research was not the art of war it was the technology of war which is very different technology means more of an exact science of how to do something versus art implies adding your own creativity I want to give you just one quote says this following this reasoning supreme skill is not 100 victories in 100 battles supreme skill is subduing the enemy without battle so if we take a look at that quote and compare it to the battle that system and a virus how would we subdue the virus 19 we know that that virus pretty much only attacks someone with a weakened immune system so the obvious strategy would necessarily only be to avoid the virus forever it would be also to strengthen the immune system because that virus really can against a really strong immune system all right so let player the B cells B cells make antibodies so antibodies are created from an infection so in other words this is where your immune system learn from being exposed to a very specific pathogen so soon as it gets exposed and you go through the infection can you recover the next time that specific microbe invade your body your immune system is ready it will neutralize that infection so you have immunity you massive reaction anymore and one way that the antibodies do this is they lock on to a pathogen it handcuffs and they keep it from going into the cell so it dries out and it dies another way that it does it is it tags the pathogen they assist in the killing by identifying who are the bad guys so then the killer T cells come in there and do the dirty work so Dave give me an example of something in the military that that couple examples working as a team with other capabilities is really critical to your effectiveness so one would be a sniper and the scout or the spotter that have one individual who targets and passing the information or where the targets are to the person who has the skill to actually shoot the weapon so that effective team the scout and the sniper working together another one to be I think a naval aviation in the Cold War one aircraft might fly out that has a great sensor suite so they can soak up electronic signals while they to find an adversary ship or something like that but that aircraft isn to have the weapons that would be needed to take out the actual ship so one aircraft has the sensors the other one has the weapons and once the first one finds the adversary then the other one is tasked with eliminating that adversary all right so the last player and the adaptive immune system is called the T regulatory cell now this cell is also called the T suppressor cell and one of the functions of this cell is to differentiate between the bad guys and the good guys so this is very very very important because it diseases and if this cell doesn correctly your body will start to develop antibodies against its own tissue and that could be to any tissue so you can have ms lupus Hashimoto rheumatoid arthritis where you have these antibodies that are attacking itself autoimmune conditions is very similar to friendly-fire in the military Dave can you give us a little example of what could happen in military if you have a role player or a traitor we are very concerned about those interlopers or those rogue agents well the military has a lot of things in place to find try to find spies that kind of rogue element can do extreme damage to an entire country its highest its greatest secrets on same thing even on that carrier strike group example one adversary aircraft it force returning to the carrier could wipe out a carrier whether its defenses are down so it who friendly and who important thing about the t-regulatory cells is it has a suppressive action it calms down the immune system it puts out the fire when you have this hyper inflammatory response it cytokine storm so really what kills people in certain infections is not necessarily the viral entity it killer cells over here and this cell because the regulatory cell is deficient we don the fire so that pretty much completes all the different players in the immune system Dave do you have anything else you want to add to this there that George General George Patton in World War two had and he said that planning is everything and plans are nothing hmm in other words you can come up with a plan to fight a battle but it everything is going to change after the first shot is fired but the importance learning about your adversary understanding yourself is absolutely everything you can identify how to prepare you can identify your own weaknesses you can identify your adversaries weaknesses and your own strengths and their strengths so you know where to attack you know where to fortify your own weaknesses that everything that will help you be prepared to fight an adversary and our military is doing that all the time against all our adversaries and I would think that you would probably say that exactly what your audience needs to be doing and what we need to be doing ok I just want to say thank you so much for your service and also for helping me in this presentation and I also want to mention to you watching you have in your body right now the most amazing kick-ass military immune system that ever existed and all you have to do is feed it the right foods take care of it take the vitamin D the vitamin C it is zinc and it will return the favor by protecting you

Leptin is an Immune Hormone	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioiR1XqA55U	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let known as an appetite hormone so the more you have the less hungry you are but leptin also has a huge immune function that I want to talk about and as a side note the Greek word for the word leptin means thin because of the suppression of the appetite when you increase leptin the hunger goes away because there cell to your brain specifically the hypothalamus telling the brain we have enough nutrition or food but when leptin is low you are hungry leptin is made by your fat cells and the intestinal cells but here levels of leptin start causing what called leptin resistance now this is very similar to insulin resistance where you have this high level of insulin produced by consuming a lot of carbohydrates and what happens over time is your receptors start to downgrade and now you can anymore same exact thing happens with leptin high levels of leptin over a long period of time kind of desensitize the receptor and now you don absorption of that hormone here problem the feedback loops that are supposed to go back to the fat cells really don the receptor so the fat cell keeps making more and more and more but you have the situation where you have all this leptin but it have symptoms of a leptin deficiency starving and in excess as well and another purpose of leptin is to suppress both parts of the immune system to calm inflammation down so people that don have enough leptin have higher risks of getting an autoimmune problem because they have way too much inflammation and when you have a lot of inflammation in your body your immune system is actually weaker so the reason why I wanted to talk about leptin is to mention that the way to fix this is the exact same procedure as you would to fix insulin resistance and that is doing keto and in a minute fasting these together over a period of time will solve insulin resistance and leptin resistance which will also help your immune system greatly so when people ask you with some of the benefits of keto and Amir fasting you can tell them and has a huge benefit on helping suppress inflammatory conditions as well as supporting a healthy immune system thanks for watching	Success
Why Being Fat Weakens Your Immune System	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-bgyDgWOHM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we relationship between your fat and your immune system what you need to know is that obesity weakens the immune system but the question is why and how there two main types of fat you have the superficial fat around your body which is the stuff right beneath your skin and then you have visceral fat that is the fat that spilling off from your liver being fat because there fat goes around the organs and sometimes inside the organs with superficial fat you of B cells which make antibodies and T cells okay that these are two different immune cells but with the visceral fat you have more natural killer cells and kill it T cells now what does that mean that means you things right here which cause a lot of inflammation so people that have visceral fat have more inflammation because they have an overly active immune system the buffer for this over-reactive immune system the thing that is called the t regulatory cells and those are going to be deficient when you have too much visceral fat so what making the inflammation is your actual immune system the other thing that really bad about having too much visceral fat is the antibodies that you create against viruses and even bacteria they tend to lose their memory a lot quicker so they don infection so you have less fighting force when you have more visceral fat now this really applies to the köppen xix situation in that one of the big predisposing factors is being overweight not to mention the things that go with being overweight high blood pressure diabetes metabolic syndrome etc so we have very specific types of immune cells that are being generated by having this type of fat around your midsection we have deficiency the cells that are supposed to suppress the inflammation so thereby increasing inflammation inflammation itself weakens the immune system being overweight weakens the immune system and also the cascade of inflammation that from these immune cells can create insulin resistance now in the other videos I talked extensively about consuming sugar and refined carbs increase insulin resistance consuming frequent meals increase insulin resistance but I really haven mentioned inflammation causing insulin resistance now if someone inflammation could be just the thing to push them over the edge into diabetes because really the difference between a pre-diabetic situation and diabetes is that insulin resistance suddenly fails to compensate for insulin and then the shift takes place so let me just kind of draw this out so you can get this because it pancreas right here we have the cell right here and we have the hormone right here so this is insulin pancreas cell and receptor so let me just show you what insulin resistance is I won this insulin into the cell so what gonna happen is because we don connection we don loop to turn off this insulin so it pumps more and more and more to the point where you have five to seven times the amount of insulin then you should and all that excess insulin is kind of camouflaging the problem because it pushing the blood sugars down because usually the person is consuming a lot of carbs this inflammation right here can almost act like a carbohydrate and push us to the extent where your cells and the pancreas gets so tired exhausted they more insulin so the insulin starts going down down down because of this so now you have a situation the cells are burnt plus you have this at the same time there Sugar pre-diabetes to diabetes and that really the mechanism so what do you have to do you have to get on keto to intermittent fasting and as this visceral fat goes away the inflammation is going to go away and that improve over time to reverse this thing so I wanted to demonstrate it the carbs and the frequency of eating it that can cause the problem and this inflammation could also come from other sources as well omega-3 fatty acids injuries infections like virus infections chronically anyway there lot more to talk about this but I just wanted to cover this one point thanks for watching Hey with another amazing recipe no brains no sugar totally keto there absolutely not Karen and it system builder absolutely do you have to check this out I think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it what is it simple it you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating	Success

Why Urine Smells Like Burnt Popcorn? Â Solutions by Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlpexmireMA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so recently I had a question from someone on my youtube channel that want to know why their urine is smelling like burnt popcorn so let about what that is that is a condition where you you ketoacidosis but you amount and it usually happens after you fasting I would say about between 16 to 18 to 20 hours especially when you wake up in the morning when your urine is more concentrated your urine could smell like popcorn now this is not a bad thing it just means that you hardcore ketosis okay so that means it working and you can even check your urine or your blood and you that now it to modify that you can adjust your protein downward a little bit sometimes when you you usually if you protein it ammonia now ammonia could also be in a UTI but most of time you just need to adjust the amount of protein bring it down a little bit and that goes away the other thing you can do is just adjust your fluids consume more fluid to help dilute that concentration if you want to see my other video related to the urine and how to identify certain problems based on the color of your urine I put it up right here check it out	Success
Are You Wearing Your Mask Too Long?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-G8YT7xXTc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let masks okay now I can see wearing a mask in a condensed area especially if someone like that but a lot of times when I go out for long walks in in an area where it wearing the mask and they themselves I see people driving their car by themselves and they I want to just talk about if that good thing or a bad thing so here things I want to talk about relating to the mask a mask will restrict the air flow to your lungs okay and depending on what type of mask that you will determine how much air is getting through the mask will stress the respiratory muscles okay around the lung especially if you are wearing the mask for a long period of time now the mask you probably saw me wearing in the in the thumbnail look like wool this is part of a hypoxic training program where I lungs intermittently for maybe like two minutes while I breathing hard and then I back and forth so I it you body recover so you can then build up the muscles around the loan so I know this is different because you exercise and of course people wearing the masks are not necessarily exercising but sometimes they are as well so the point I someone is fragile and they they a problem because you stress to an area of their body that is already weakened and they already susceptible and vulnerable to getting that virus the point is when you outside not around people you need to take that mask off and actually just let air go in unless you you definitely you want to go back and forth if you want to take it off and you want to put it back on but the fact is if you put something over your mouth obstructing the air you to reduce oxygen into the lungs okay so that types of masks that give you different filtration okay you have the n95 medical mask gives you 95 percent of filtration with the pores being point three microns so it hundred percent but 95 percent is pretty good a regular surgical mask will provide between 60 to 80 percent filtration if you take a 600 thread-count pillowcase and you have four layers that will give you about 60% filtration then you have those bandanas 100% cotton bandana four layers will only give you about 19.5% particle filtration so the best standard number you is a point three micron now the size of the virus is point one micron now you saying well wait a second this virus can squeeze through this hole pretty easily because this is three times the size true but the more filtration you have the less air you the less you breathe so there getting enough oxygen and filtering out a virus so you can pretty much put a plastic bag over your head and get a hundred percent but of course you going to be able to survive that long so there is this the virus itself usually is traveling on a droplet especially if someone is sneezing coughing breathing or talking to you so the size of the droplet okay is much bigger than the virus because a droplet is composed of fluid some protein salts other minerals electrolytes and even microbes so you have a lot of things kind of like a little fluid gel that in the air so now the viruses are entrapped in this larger amount of fluid they the mask there you that are gonna get through right but here variable of your susceptibility to the virus how healthier immune system is and the viral load or the concentration of viruses so if there particles that are getting in your body and you have a strong immune system you with no problem so the sicker you are and the higher the viral load the more you need to worry about your mask but if you around people that are sneezing or coughing your face and you get exposed to some viruses in the virus load is low your immune system will deal with it you might have some very very mild symptoms so there severity of the infection and this right here the viral load I think the worst case scenario is if you nurse working in a hospital and you around the concentration of viruses then you have the velocity of someone else maybe spreading some viruses on you so you have the sneeze which could potentially project between seven and eight meters that depending on how strong that sneeze is or someone between 5 to 6 meters 19 feet it pretty strong cough or if they breathing on you we about 2 meters about 7 feet now this is the distance that it could potentially travel of course the greater the distance the less the viral concentration but then we have the droplet particles okay so if someone sneezing roughly could be around 40,000 droplets okay versus someone coughing on you that talking to you for about 30 minutes that could total about 3,000 droplets so you can see the concentration down here the viral load is going to be a lot smaller than someone sneezing on you so the reason I show you the different variables of velocity your own susceptibility the viral load the filtration and the time that you wear the mask if you are weak and you have a poor immune system especially if your chronic smoker or you have COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma you shouldn wearing this mask all day long anyway that hear your

#1 Reason Why Your Kid is Overweight	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlQbaWbHpZo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so let reason why your child may be overweight now you get all these interesting answers from people they it well they watch too much TV they they which is true but there reason carbohydrates would be number two but number one is snacking between 1977 in 2014 there increase in the amount of snacking that not only involved children but adults as well now here snacking you have various hormones that are secreted in your stomach and especially the smaller intestine right turn here that will activate and stimulate insulin after you eat so it carbohydrates it child is snacking in between the meals that keeps the insulin high anything of any significant calories will trigger insulin and insulin prevents the loss of fat as well as causes the storage of fat so you got the number one reason is the frequency of eating and number two definitely is the carbohydrates now if you combine that carbohydrate with a snack not very good here are the most common snacks that kids are fed yogurt and I yogurt talking about flavored yogurt vanilla yogurt just 3.5 ounces gives you 13 grams of sugar then you have popcorn which is low fat and fiber it very high on the glycemic index turns into sugar and will spike the blood glucose very very fast and then we have apple sauce which is basically concentrated sugar because it an apple with the fiber and then cooking it pasteurizing it so it high on the glycemic index as well before energy bars I mean the granola bar for example has 19 grams of net carbs way too much now juice is a snack as well you a very concentrated amount of sugar from a fruit of course you don benefits of the vitamins from the fruit because she if you meal you want to look at it as a snack as well this is probably the worst snack right through here of all these and then we have number six crackers and peanut butter now the problem is that peanut butter usually has added sugar so if you sure you read the label of course crackers are very high in the glycemic index as well and then we have apples now you might say well wait a second apples are fruit fruit has been altered over the years to make it very very sweet apples on average contain 19 grams of sugar and that sugar in fact even before I started doing keto I had a little pizza crust around my waist and I wasn of these but I sure was eating a lot of apples so this whole concept of eating an apple a day will keep the doctor away is not exactly true well maybe if you actually shot the Apple at the doctor hard enough it will keep the doctor away but apples are definitely not on the list alright so if you have children and you want to make a transition the first thing you need to do is go through your cupboard and your refrigerator and get all the snacks that are higher in carbohydrate out of the house just make some agreements that you carry it in the house anymore you can do it like a little gradual thing where you replace it with celery and peanut butter without sugar cucumber and hummus might be a alternative snack and then avocado and salsa might be a good snack as a transition or even an egg but ideally you don snacks have three meals okay make sure they have enough calories and enough healthy fats but listen your kids don snacks they death in fact if you cut down the carbs and the snacks you kids are gonna be way more focused you find that their mood is so much better their performance at school will be better because they their brain on ketones not glucose not to mention the reduction of insulin so they won they will lose a lot of weight so you want to cut out the snacks and definitely cut out the carbs if you new to keto and you want to know more about it I put the video right here to watch	Success

How Sugar Affects Your Immune System	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqd-MdtES4s	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let high blood sugar affects your immune system okay we glycaemia it has a huge effect on suppressing your immune system in fact hyperglycemia diabetes is one of the big factors involved in the kovat situation massively increasing your risk for mortality number one high blood sugar inhibits chemotaxis now what is that that is the movement of white blood cells through the body towards where they need to do their work like an infection or a part of the body that damaged so it blood cells triggered by certain chemicals in the body number two we have impaired phagocytosis phagocytosis is the mechanism where certain white blood cells will engulf and eat and kill pathogens viruses bacteria fungus mold and there the neutrophils okay neutrophils make up 90% of all the pus in your body after an infection and they so you have less neutrophils and then macrophages are the big phagocytes that are professional phagocytes and they basically are the guard to protect you and they will just go around and golfing pathogens and eating them up and putting them in these little vesicles and dumping acid in there hydrogen peroxide the main ingredient in Bleach and that how they kill these microbes so you have less neutrophils less macrophages and you have less of their weapon tree so you pretty much just take down a big part of the body high sugar or when you consume a lot of sugar number three you have inhibited complement cascade now what is that well complement cascade is a series of events that occur that will cause the bacterial membrane to burst so basically it number four when you have high levels of sugar in the blood you develop acidosis so the pH starts to go down that that by itself inhibits immunity number five it slows the white blood cells moving through the tissues now these white blood cells are fascinating because they have the ability to actually go right through your tissues right through the lymphatic system through organs through blood vessels so all that movement is inhibited so it would be comparable to let your own army and they had to walk through a huge muddy field and they were getting stuck and it couldn well that system now one of the big effects of having high blood sugar is the destruction of the vascular system especially to the nerves to other parts of the body so with high sugar you gonna have less oxygen through the body and with that you increase microbes that can live in that environment they anti ROK in areas that don fungus candida and this is going to increase the risk for infection fungal infections Candida infections and many other types of pathogens and lastly you immunity and that system that is the wall okay so you have the skin and then you have the inner skin and hyperglycemia destroys those barriers so now we don protection like we did when we were healthy so if you personally have hyperglycemia and you need to learn about healthy keto and intermittent fasting I put a video up just for you right here check it out	Success
What are the Adrenal Glands? Â Effects of Cortisol & Adrenal Hormones Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9225P7K7bSs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys Dr Berg here in this video I want to talk about the adrenal glands now I have a lot of different videos on different aspects of the adrenal but I don basics of what the adrenal glands do now there two glands right on top of the kidney right down in here and they are stress glands so the body um will respond to physical and mental stress with the help of the adrenal gland so the adrenal glands basically adapt the different parts of your body to a stress so it can cope for example if you being chased by a tiger uh the adrenal gun will produce hormones to activate more blood flow to the muscle increase heart rate increase blood pressure uh mental acuity so you prepare yourself for flight Runway or fight okay so the adrenal gland is very unique because it has an outside in an inside the outside is all gland tissue the inside is not gland tissue it nerve tissue it have this gland wrapped around a nerve bundle and the nerve bundle makes neurot transmitters and probably because of of its location it can have quick access to the heart and different organs because it it makes adrenaline noradrenaline which is a pre- adrenaline hormone um and also makes camines which are things like uh dopamine serotonin um Gaba all the different neurotransmitters are made there and it system which again is the flight or fight mechanism it adrenal now the outside has primarily three categories of hormones maybe four if you want to classify them a little differently uh the first one is um called glucocorticoids which is basically cortisol and by the way all these hormones are or steroids that are made from cholesterol that need a certain amount of cholesterol to make them especially under stress but the gluc corticoids um the name gives it away glucose okay they they sugars okay so that too much of that hormone you can end up becoming a diabetic um because it produces uh it turns basically things into sugar pretty quickly your own muscle uh so it makes quick energy so if it has too much it going to get all sorts of issues this is the one that um I talk about producing belly fat but really only through insulin because it increases insulin so insulin is the main co uh main hormone that does it but it trigger it so cortisol affects stress blood sugars immune suppression now think about all the autoimmune diseases out there um you know where your body attacks its own tissue and then what the treatment for all of them steroids prazone what hormone cortisol so your own body is supposed to produce hormones to counter that and suppress stress in fact if you look at the remedy uh prazone in what conditions it it treats all sorts of skin problems pain syndromes inflammatory conditions immune conditions um organ rejection type um hormone so everything with immune suppression so it affects the immune system big time if the adrenal glands are weakened it put makes you susceptible to viruses so it important uh hormone uh it actually affects bone so if you have too much of this hormone you can have bone loss uh controls vitamin D levels so you could be low in Vitamin D from the adrenal being stressed out so it does a lot okay so the next one is mineral corticoids that would be um a hormone that controls the electrolytes potassium calcium magnesium chlorides sodium so it really controls the electrolytes and the sodium fluid balance in the body and that might get high blood pressure they give you a diuretic because you have a sodium imbalance it right here the name of it is called aldosterone okay then we have androgens which is male hormones females have androgens men have more but the adrenal gland also produces androgens it also produces estrogen interesting so when a female goes through menopause uh the adrenal gland literally has to work a little harder to back up the loss of the ovarian function and that comes from the adrenal uh also then you have DHEA which is kind of a precursor uh hormone that turns into these other hormones so if you DHEA which most people are as they age you lose Vitality you lose your energy your ability to sleep but it the adrenal gland so um what do people do they live on stimulants they start to try to live on coffee and and things to wake them up 5H Hour Energy drinks to try to wake them up the problem is the stimulants kind of stimulate the adrenal keep it going but then it kind of burns out over more and you become adrenal fatigued and you kind now you can thing is make sure when you eat you have enough potassium in the food because potassium is a calming mineral it relaxes the adrenal and when you deficient in potassium everything kind of speeds right up all right thanks for watching hi guys Hey listen I created a pretty amazing evaluation quiz down below that actually analyzes your symptoms to find the cause the

How Long Does Magnesium Stay in the Body?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul2MRZWnGCA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I want to talk about magnesium and how long it stays in your body now the certain minerals that go through the body pretty quickly other minerals don like for example sodium iron and calcium tend to be retained in the body but magnesium potassium and zinc are not held very long now what determines the retention or the recycling of potassium is how healthy your kidneys are if your kidneys are very very healthy you may only lose you know half of a percent versus if they you will lose a lot more there gap on how much your body is going to hold versus excrete and because the kidneys have the ability to get rid of excess magnesium magnesium is rarely toxic to the body but you get rid of between 0.5 and 70% of your magnesium within a 24-hour period so it magnesium coming in the body the RDAs for a female for magnesium are between 310 and 360 and a male it they have to realize the RDAs are only there to prevent deficiencies they not the dose that you should normally have to maintain a healthy body so these numbers should be a lot higher in fact I think they should be at least 500 to 600 milligrams per day but the average American is only consuming between 2 to 300 milligrams per day now if we also add in all the other diseases like for example diabetes the need for magnesium goes way way up because you simply do not retain magnesium if you have blood sugar problems also if you lot of alcohol that is going to severely decrease the ability to hold magnesium now when you consume magnesium from the diet you between 24 to 76 percent of the magnesium from the food and that really varies because if there damage in your colon that could be a factor if there Hydra gasps in your stomach that can also alter your absorption and there reasons as well about 50% of all the magnesium in your body is stored in your bone it eating a lot of food with magnesium your body will just pull it from the bone that could be a problem if you keep doing them and some of it is stored in the muscle probably the number one symptom of the magnesium deficiency is fatigue because your mitochondria the energy factories of your cells need magnesium to create ATP which is the energy currency of the body so we need magnesium for energy if you crave chocolate you could be deficient because there and your body will tend to crave those things that have a certain nutrient than it 99% of all the magnesium your body is inside the cell and only 1% is outside the cell so if you were to get a test for magnesium in your blood you really would not get the accurate picture of what get an intracellular test I link down below of a company that can test your your magnesium it intracellular testing why are you deficient in magnesium well number one it consuming refined foods that strip all the magnesium out that reason why people are deficient in magnesium just basically refined sugars grains things like that the next reason is they phytates are located in the fiber of grains so if you eat a lot of oatmeal which by the way has a good amount of magnesium you absorb it because of the phytates phytates bind the magnesium in and will not let you absorb that magnesium so if you grains legumes they phytates and typically whole grain cereal has good about of magnesium but it so you you kidney damage that ability to absorb magnesium now you might say well I don damage well did you realize that the number one cause of kidney damage is diabetes and 90% of people that are pre-diabetic don that probably 70% of the population has insulin resistance which is a pre pre-diabetes situation and if you have insulin resistance that not only could block magnesium from be going in the body but also over time it can lead to some kidney problems and the last reason why people are deficient is they don consume enough chlorophyll type foods chlorophyll at the center of it has magnesium it chemistry where we have iron but chlorophyll it plant so if you of vegetables and salads that could be another common source of why you need more magnesium so one of the first symptoms you deficiency would be fatigue another one would be a palpitation or your heart starts to go at a rhythm your muscles feel weak and there symptoms if you want more information about the symptoms of the magnesium deficiency I put that video up right here check it out	Success
Why Certain People Get Asthma	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2w1A01lSmM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we asthma and some very interesting things about asthma that maybe you heard before what is asthma it chronic lung inflammatory condition it really a problem with your immune system some of the symptoms wheezing coughing chest tightness shortness of breath it usually worse at night when you exercising you pollution or being exposed to a certain type of allergies that you have that trigger the asthma one of the best remedies for asthma is sunshine if your child has asthma put them outside and have them be exposed to a lot of Sun that gives them the vitamin D that they need and you see that they symptoms now look at this 397 thousand people a year die of asthma that was in 2015 it usually begins when you younger before 12 years old the Greek word for asthma means panting okay exposure to bacteria and early childhood prevents asthma versus living in a hyper clean environment increases your risk of getting asthma why is that because you develop your immune system through being exposed to pathogens so you start developing antibodies so without those antibodies you have a weakened immune system also there getting asthma if you lived on a farm or you have pets why because there exposure to pathogens when you in a farm or you have a pet what increases the risk of getting asthma is having early antibiotics so you young kid and you you keep getting this infection and your parents put you on an antibiotic over and over and over that will increase the risk of asthma also if you had a c-section that can increase the risk of getting asthma by 20 to 80 percent why is that because you exposed to the good bacteria that you need as a part of your immune system so if you have a child that has asthma I would definitely get them on a probiotic because the gut health is vitally important and of course with a lot of vitamin D now it therapy which I like called Buteyko therapy I put a link down below here what happens when you have asthma your breathing from the upper chest your breathing more out of your mouth you trying to get more air in okay and the problem with that is that heavy mouth breathing decreases your co2 and that is not a good thing so when you have decreased co2 in the lungs you have also decreased oxygen in your blood because co2 and oxygen work together and what happens when you have less co2 the oxygen binds tighter with the hemoglobin and it start breathing through your nose okay doing that is going to help normalize the co2 and the oxygen and you want to calm down the breathing you want to breathe slower and calmer but that going to stimulate something called the parasympathetic nervous system because think about it when you you activate the sympathetic nervous system and especially even when you start breathing like that that is going to create a vasoconstriction okay not a laser dilation but we already have a problem with with air getting to the lungs and oxygen throughout the body so we want to slow it down you want to focus on breathing through the nose the diaphragm and that will actually create a much better effect so anyway I put some links down below check them out and I another amazing recipe no brains no sugar totally Kido there not character and it builder absolutely you have to check this out I think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it simple it enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating	Success
The Best Way to Get Metabolic Flexibility	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqtS67ov0XU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I did a video on the topic of coming off keto and going back on keto and then not getting results and someone had a question about metabolic flexibility so I thought I topic so what is metabolic flexibility it fuels so you switch on high carb and your body is able to adapt to it and your metabolism is fairly good now the first thing I want to mention is there people that have metabolic flexibility most people have metabolic inflexibility so they start going from high carb to low-carb and then high carb the low carbon every time they do that they have a harder and harder time of getting in ketosis and adapting and also what happens when they go back and forth because they and there they can consistent they actually slow their metabolism over a period of time the question is how did they become metabolic inflexible in the first place a history of insulin elevation over time this little hormone insulin is the gatekeeper it is the main thing that determines what type of fuel you gonna burn if the insulin goes up you not going to burn fat you sugar if the insulin goes down you will burn fat but this hormone gets damaged as you stimulate this hormone over time by consuming a lot of carbs and also by eating frequently and you start developing insulin resistance and this is the thing that really is behind a slow metabolism and a stuck setpoint where no matter what you do you can seem to get below a certain weight and that comes from yo-yo dieting especially if you low fat diet which so many people have done that also stress will ruin this system pregnancy puts a lot of stress in that system and many women who become pregnant have the baby find that that where the metabolism has slowed down so this hormone change can really affect this system right here lack of sleep let you years that can greatly affect your metabolism overtraining I remember I worked on a patient who was exercising I seven days a week that she couldn chance of recovering from that okay then we have inflammation if you have inflammation in the body that can create insulin resistance so if you enough not to have to go through a lot of these stressors you may have metabolic flexibility and you can pretty much get away with going back and forth and back and forth but if you most people and you have metabolic inflexibility including myself you gonna have to try a different approach you with the cheat day you be consistent consistently keeping the insulin normalized through doing healthy keto in a minute fasting exercise consistently and making sure that your nutrients in the food are at a high level and it does take some time to really correct this I months possibly even a few years because I don that hey in three or four weeks your metabolism is going to be corrected and you can go back to your normal foods because now you have a fast metabolism now if you need more information about Plateau I put that video right here check it out	Success
The Most Important White Blood Cell (WBC)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rFnlRtGDZs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	all right today we about the most important white blood cell now this is my own viewpoint and I quite a few different white blood cells but the T regulatory cell I believe is one of the most important ones another name for the T regulatory cell is the T suppressor cell same thing and you probably see it as T reg T re G for short and if you wanted to know the full name of it this is another name then you can look for not that you would ever be interested but what white blood cell is that it pretty much does the opposite of what all the other cells are doing it is suppressing the immune system it is producing anti-inflammatory cytokines it keeps the balance okay it keeps the immune system from overreacting it ends the immune infection it lowers mucus pretty much almost all the other immune cells are producing more mucus producing inflammation killing things this guy is all about chilling things out so really it does two main things it suppresses the immune system and number two which is very important it regulates self tolerance now what does that mean that means it prevents your body from developing antibodies to itself they basically prevents autoimmune conditions so to do that it has to identify the good guys from the bad guys and it you can this cell you would develop antibodies against your own tissue and have a lot of inflammation so if there with the cell the person develops irritable bowel disease type 1 diabetes which is an autoimmune Ms rheumatoid arthritis asthma and even the cytokine storm which is the actual reason why certain people are dying of Koba 19 those people that have a very weakened immune system so apparently when you have a weakened immune system the is the weakness right here and then the other parts of the immune system are in hyperdrive they destruction creating a lot of collateral damage to the tissues in the body that very very interesting but then how can we strengthen this cell right here well it just so happens there are several nutrients and things that are intimately involved with this cell right here if you are vitamin A deficient this cell will malfunction you won of T regulatory cells in your body and it supports the mucous membranes in fact that reactions can occur - right below the mucous lining there on the inner skin so vitamin A is a real key factor in supporting the immune system and then we have vitamin D vitamin D by itself is anti-inflammatory but if you deficient in vitamin D these cells just do not work correctly now the T stands for thymus because they the thymus gland and they get their training in the thymus gland so anything that goes on with the thymus gland that shrinks it or causes it to atrophy will cause a problem with this cell right here and it just so happens that by Miss atrophy occurs when you zinc also if you have a lot of stress and you activate cortisol for too long that can also shrink the thymus not to mention as you age the thymus shrinks so that your immune system you get more inflammation you cytokine storm then we have something called DHA this is an omega-3 fatty acid if you work that well probiotics now if you think about it children that have had a lot of antibiotics early on really have a problem with increased risk of asthma diabetes type 1 irritable bowel syndrome a lot more inflammation allergies why because your friendly bacteria are part of the immune system so one thing that is to make sure you have enough of the right bacteria and then we have the factor of gluten gluten has been known to interrupt the regulation of this right here which makes sense because certain people develop antibodies to gluten which creates an autoimmune problem called celiac which is an inflammatory condition in the bowel so now we again now in the study that I validate this information which I a link down below they also had the ad in there a high-fat diet weakens the t-rex cells so I had to look that one up because I found it hard to believe and I found that the high-fat diet that they used with this rat study was from bioserve okay there F 3 - 8 - and if we take a look at exactly what they ate and what the thigh fat diet was the carbohydrates were 35.7% a true keto diet is only 5% carbs so yes this is a high-fat diet but it was also a high carb diet as well and the reason I say that is because the fat was 36% almost the same as the carbohydrate so it was a high carb and high fat diet which we know if you combine carbs the high fat diet you gonna create a massive problem with the body especially with the spike of insulin which would then suppress the immune system you dysfunction and then if we go down to the ingredients lard casein maltodextrin which is the worst sugar of all sucrose mineral mix vitamin mix and of course these were synthetic methionine choline chloride so you can pretty much just scratch off a high-fat diet because they really did not use a keto diet they just use a combination of high fat with a bunch of other sugars which you would never feed anyone in years these are the things right here that you one of the most important white blood cells which is the T regulatory cells if you haven strengthening the immune system I put it up right here check it out	Success
What is Lactose Intolerance Explained By Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRPzSRWNjyY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hello Dr Burke here we about lactose intolerance okay uh a lot of people have this and I don know they have it and some people think they have it but they don it so let intolerance is a situation where you can sugar and there are dairy products that you can buy that says lactose free but here are the symptoms gas bloating inflammation pain in the abdomen uh you know pretty much right after you or it could be delayed several minutes rumbling in the intestines sometimes a lactose intolerance occurs lower in the uh small intestine so it takes maybe even an hour to kind of get down there until you react so it immediate okay but the point is these are the symptoms so you have to differentiate is a lactose intolerance issue or is it a milk allergy two separate things an allergy is an allergy to a reaction to the protein in milk which is casine has nothing to do with the milk sugar so if you um consume lactose free products dairy products and you still have a reaction it could be you have a milk allergy the best thing to do is go get tested and just see if you have a lactose uh intolerance or is it an allergy to milk and especially if you reacting to milk and you you get pain um now why do you have lactose intolerance problem well it could be several reasons could be a previous damage to your intestinal lining let you had a lot of antibiotics let were given uh vaccinations that threw off your system um let raised on um pasteurized commercial milk with all the different hormones and chemicals and your body started developing resistance um let have a loss of your immune system for some reason like a huge stress event and you start getting an autoimmune disorder and that made you your immune system weak so there things and even as you age you develop um a resistance or an intolerance to lactose uh because really you the enzyme lactase to be able to break down lactose and it can happen on a gradient scale where you lactose intolerance and then it and more severe okay all right so what do you do about it you want to get a good probiotic so you can start building up your Flora your intestinal bacteria so those little guys can start making the enzyme lactase to digest lactose uh the one that you would want to get when you read the label the type of microb would be bifidobacterium longum okay so I below if you want to get the exact spelling because those little guys will start making lactase which is the enzyme to break down lactose now the other thing about um what to avoid um if you to avoid processed cheeses cheese or milk itself uh yogurt and cottage cheese because those are the um milk products that have high sugar now anytime you read the label and it says sugar you can be pretty much guarantee that that is the amount of lactose in the uh product okay so just look at the sugar so processed cheese for example has 19 gam of sugar that means you have 19 gam of lact lactose that you product uh milk 12 G yogurt 10 gram cotage cheese six grams of sugar that all lactose but when you get into cheese like aging cheeses like cheddar or swiss that is zero well it sometimes zero gram of sugar or Zer gram of lactose so just read the labels I mean if you really want to be safe just get it zero but sometimes even a small amount of lactose or milk sugar is not going to be a problem all right so thanks for watching go ahead and apply this and put your comments below hey you probably already subscribed but if you haven below and I will keep you updated	Success

Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6xh5DHbsiw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hi guys I had another question why does my urine have a strong stinky odor okay we you are not on a ketogenic program and you have that odor uh it could be a urinary tract infection it could be liver damage it could be you Foods you vegetables okay but if you are on a keto uh intermittent fasting program it could either be the ketones that are not being burned coming out initially when you adapting to ketosis there transitional period of Keto adaptation and in that process you more ketones coming out of your urine and sometimes it it should be but when you do it a little longer you because your system is more efficient and chances are you eating as much fat uh because your body is is more efficient so what happen is you more ketone and less odor over time okay now uh if it be the smell of uh you ever have one of those CDs that that you would stick in your car or some type of CD player and you take the plastic off the smell of that plastic it smell it now um this usually is too much protein okay so what are you going to do to kind of counter this uh kind of nasty smell um there you want to support the liver with certain types of vegetables for example you want to do more beet tops in your salad uh a real good one would be dandelion greens okay you get them at the heha store you can get them in your backyard but just make sure if you have a dog you know they because sometimes they urinate on those little weeds but this weed the dline greens um is amazing for liver Rejuvenation okay so you want to have some of those bitter uh greens for the liver and that will actually clean up a lot of the odor especially if it ammonia or actually even keep ketones um you want to start to uh make sure you have enough fluids so you don whole day just with like a half a cup of fluid uh make sure you consume you can put electrolytes but just drink a little bit more fluid because especially when you a diuretic and you get rid of uh excess waste that way so it but you need to replace some liquids as well and then if you exercising on top of that you probably need more fluids but my whole point is don than you you is you want to adjust your proteins um I don is heavier on the proteins or high protein diet it protein 3 to 6 ounces if you have too much protein you definitely going to have more ammonia type smell all right and lastly chlorophyll is a great deodorizer it detoxifier you can get liquid chlorophyll you can use my wheat grass um this stuff right here one teaspoon is a whole tray of weat grass and it just helps to purify and clean the system to high in chlorophyl and it counter that bad odor all right thanks for watching hey if you haven subscribed press this little button down below okay thanks	Success
The Crazy Side Effects of Thiazide Diuretics (High Blood Pressure Medication) Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfOBh1cAArk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys in this video I wanted to talk about the side effects of thide that high blood pressure medication also known as hypochloride which is a diuretic for high blood pressure and edema it pulls water out of your body okay but it comes with a package it also pulls your electrolytes specifically potassium magnesium and other electrolytes okay so here are the side effects hypokalemia now what does that mean that now just think about it potassium is needed in large quantities in the diet most people don what they really need and the side effects of low pottassium are palpitations arrhythmias muscle weakness cramps so rhythmia okay and the big side effect from hypokalemia is high blood pressure I have to check this out so here we are taking this medication to get rid of high blood pressure but it high blood pressure potassium relaxes the blood vessels it C it counteracts the retention of sodium the other side effect is Hypoglycemia do you know what that is that effect hyper lipidemia that cholesterol here acid that it hyponatremia when you of water sometimes you can develop hyponatremia as well where you actually getting rid of all the sodium and you get muscle cramps and leg weakness your body needs about 1,000 milligram of sodium every single day so if you that can be damaging to the heart as well low magnesium we need electrolytes to be healthy so a loss of electrolytes will make you tired weak muscle cramps high blood glucose a regular heartbeat and even high blood pressure so I put a link down below to show you the potential cause of high blood pressure thanks for watching hey you probably already subscribed but if you haven press this little button down below and I will keep you updated	Success
Metabolic Syndrome Is Really the Hyperinsulinemia Syndrome	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gB0RTqi-I	Dr. Eric Berg DC	have a very very interesting article I want to post down below and it has to do with metabolic syndrome metabolic syndrome another name for that would be syndrome X where your lipids like cholesterol is too high you have insulin resistance you have high blood sugar high blood pressure central obesity now in this article they why metabolic syndrome should really be called hyperinsulinemia syndrome now the traditional conventional viewpoint on this is that insulin resistance leads to increased insulin okay but is that actually true is it the insulin resistance that causes high insulin or is it the high insulin that causes insulin resistance now to figure this out all we have to do is observe what happens after gastric bypass where they intestine which is one part of the body that affects insulin the other part is the pancreas but there the small intestine that activates insulin so when you do gastric bypass you correct part of the high insulin problem so you reduce insulin and they find after this procedure that it reverses type-2 diabetes by 83 percent it also reverses high blood pressure by 63 percent as well as reversing high cholesterol by 61 percent now let a look at this diabetes type 2 that high blood sugar hypertension and cholesterol isn here but it also does several other things that improve sleep apnea polycystic ovarian syndrome it improves a fatty liver GERD which is a like an acid reflux and even joint pain now this study that I very interesting because they looked at 423 other studies but focused on 58 of the ones that actually measured insulin so the direct finding was if you reduce insulin you produced Changez across the board with so many different conditions and metabolic syndrome is just kind of a collection of several diseases or shall we say symptoms of this high insulin now think about it when you have high insulin over a period of time the body is going to start to resist it the insulin receptors are going to start to resist at high level so it causes the insulin resistance and of course once you have insulin resistance in the bio feedback loops they come back and actually raise more insulin but really only if you keep consuming the things that trigger insulin carbohydrates frequent eating now in type 2 diabetes you have insulin resistance and you also have high insulin for a period of time until the cells that make insulin get weaker and weaker and weaker and that goes lower lower lower and your blood Sugar higher and higher and higher so you initially have high insulin and it kind of goes lower and in obesity you have high insulin as well but you could also have diabetes type 2 and not be overweight you can be skinny and still have insulin why is this so important well if it is true that high insulin leads to insulin resistance that leads to pre-diabetes and then diabetes then it would be very very important to actually measure insulin early on and not only focus on blood sugars identifying through a blood test what your insulin is doing would be the best indicator to predict and even prevent insulin resistance as well as pre-diabetes and diabetes but unfortunately there are certain doctors that just don focused primarily on the blood sugars and the bigger problem of that not understanding this concept is to eventually start prescribing insulin to a diabetic type 2 I mean think about this if you have hyperthyroidism we have too much thyroid hormones would you ever give that patient more thyroid hormones or let problem it Cushing high cortisol of course not but you would only know if they had high cortisol or high thyroid hormone or high insulin if you tested it unfortunately that high insulin that occurs way before the pre-diabetes and diabetes a person will not have high blood sugars for many years but they may have a lot of other problems that will then be treated separately like they do with the lipids and high blood pressure and a lot of these other things and lastly and more importantly if you the the things that trigger insulin are primarily the overconsumption of carbohydrates and the frequent eating and the snacking that people are involved with to prevent their blood sugars from dropping if you want more information on how to deal with that watch this video right here	Success

5 Subclinical Magnesium Deficiency Symptoms	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3caP3r95fZ4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so we most common subclinical magnesium deficiency symptoms okay magnesium is a co enzyme okay what does that mean a coenzyme it is a helper nutrient for enzymes enzymes do all the work in the body the chemical reactions the building of tissue the repairing of tissue are all done by enzymes and magnesium other minerals and vitamins and trace minerals are essential they body needs them or things don they enzymes to work and magnesium is involved in over 300 enzymes ok from energy production to DNA repair and even preventing mutations that could eventually end up as cancer it involved in so many chemical reactions the problem is that it to detect magnesium deficiencies because most magnesium is inside the cell just like potassium for example it the cell sodium is outside the cell and that is very difficult the other point about magnesium is that the RDAs are roughly about 450 milligrams there are certain groups of people who suggest that we need even more we need like up to 600 milligrams but the average person has much less than 450 milligrams and when you calcium automatically starts going up in the body and we know a lot of people have a problem with calcium deposits calcium and the soft tissues not just from a lack of vitamin k2 but it could be from a magnesium deficiency as well let of magnesium it just a little bit the body is going to ration out that magnesium to only essential places only essential proteins things that involve present time survival not long-term repair or even probably preventing mutations so here the body is using the magnesium to cope with the daily stresses of life at the expense of a longer life so if you it can actually shorten your life and you could have more mutations and less repair in the body so there have a subclinical deficiency of magnesium number one is fatigue because my museum is involved in creating ATP which is the energy currency of the body number two cramps especially at night in the calves in your feet number three high blood pressure because without magnesium you won in the circulation in the vascular system so things become hardened okay and that pressure number four you become stiff especially in the morning when you get out of bed number five irregular heartbeat but potassium is also involved as well so it could be a combination so you may have skipped heartbeats and then maybe a palpitation then the beat starts becoming irregular it these are the five clues that you may have a magnesium deficiency so where do you get magnesium okay it of something called chlorophyll and chlorophyll makes up the green stuff in leafy green vegetables so the solution is very simple add a very large salad or two medium-sized salads to your day and get enough magnesium and watch these go away thanks for watching I just wanted to say thank you so much for watching my videos I really appreciate it and if you wouldn link down below	Success
Game of Thrones Meets Your Immune System	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VON01PTcu2g	Dr. Eric Berg DC	in this video we relationship between your own immune system and the Game of Thrones it similar in that there on between your own white blood cells or leukocytes and pathogens viruses bacteria fungus mold pathogens are those microbes that cause disease and there another part of your immune system that I want to discuss a very very long time ago there is a union created between your own cells and bacteria and they formed a mutually beneficial relationship and we now call that bacteria friendly bacteria they have become a big part of our immune system in helping defend against the unfriendly bacteria and other pathogens so in this video I want to take clips out of the game of Thrones and help you understand the immune system the Nights Watch is a military order dedicated to holding the wall the immense fortification of the northern border of the seven kingdoms led by Lord Commander Jeor Mormont any enemy trying to invade the seven kingdoms beyond the wall will have to get past the guards the Nights Watch they are always undo T to protect the realms of men from whatever is out there the exact same thing happens in your body you have guards that monitor the wall 24/7 they they bacteria and they monitor and guard the wall and in your body you have the external skin and internal skin lining all the internal skin that lines your nose your lungs your throat and your gastrointestinal tract are so large it would cover four hundred square meters the size of two tennis courts so these macrophages have a tremendous job in protecting against invading pathogens in this next example we have John Snow becoming the Lord Commander of the Nights Watch which rules over everyone there and as time goes on he rises up to become the king of the north and of course the goal of as enemies is to take him out taking out the commander or the king is a very successful strategy to win the war so in the body we have certain t-cells okay this stands for thymus the thymus is the gland that helps train your white blood cells to help defend against pathogens now the two parts of the immune system are the innate and the acquired the innate is a part of the immune system that you part of the immune system that needs training you need the expose your immune system to germs in microbes and allow the infection to occur to overcome it so it becomes stronger so you develop your immunity from experience but there central white blood cell that is the commander or the coordinator for the entire immune system and it T helper cell this is the boss that coordinates the attack it judges on how many web blood cell the body needs to create how much weapon tree what type of weapon tree so that your immune system can be successful now on the other side of the game we have certain pathogens viruses specifically the HIV virus that has its own strategy of taking out the head commander of the entire organization so this virus goes after the T helper cells and destroys the cell and that war in the final battle for King Landing Denarius targaryen instructs her dragon to not just kill specific enemies but to destroy the entire city killing off not just the enemies but the good people as well creating massive collateral damage now in the immune system you have something called the T regulatory cell it has two main functions one is to determine the good guys from the bad guys to prevent traitors and rogue elements to invade the body but it also has a very important function that relates to the example you saw in regulating the attack or a weapon tree that our immune system releases so you can think of the T regulatory cells as the water that puts out the fire or the inflammation in the body and if we don can massive inflammatory condition that creates a lot of collateral damage now any time a person tries to enter a city or a wall the guards have to determine who that person is are they a friendly person or an enemy so this is a very important job and there mechanisms in place to be able to differentiate who to allow only the friendly cells to invade the body and kill any of the pathogens now as time goes on John Snow through experience becomes more and more knowledgeable about how to kill his enemies specifically the White Walkers [Music] he learns about their strengths and their weaknesses and one weakness that have is dragonglass which is then used as one of the weapons to fight them now in the immune system and I about the acquired immune system that learns from experience we have the B cell B stands for a bone marrow because that have the cell that releases antibodies so when we antibodies interact with the germs and create memories so the next time when they specific pathogen they have this memory and they know what to do so in other words your body develops antibodies over time to deal with specific germs and so now they are prepared and they will bind with viruses and bacteria and neutralize them before they can invade the South so little finger in secret makes a deal with the city logic compass the city watch is yours good and this deal relates to turning against Ned Stark we stand behind you load stuff so later when Ned Stark gives an order the gold cloaks turn against Ned and end up killing all of his soldiers and so the city watch becomes traitors I did warn you not to trust me now the immune system we have a very similar thing happening certain mechanisms involving viruses caused our own body to create what which are antibodies against her own tissue you can look at this as friendly fire or a part of your own cells becoming traitors and attacking its own tissue so you see this a lot in autoimmune disease and many times an autoimmune condition is triggered by a virus one of the scariest abilities the white walkers have is the power to create creatures known as whites whites are reanimated corpses which continue to live as zombies who are under control of the white walkers so when we they have a certain limit to how long they can live so it could be months it could be a couple years but eventually these cells die but what happens when normal cells become damaged certain cells switch over to cancer cells and the way they do that is through a certain adaptation mechanism which their metabolism has actually changed to a completely different way of burning fuel and the other very unique thing about cancer cells is they lose their ability to die and they become immortal just like the zombies that you just saw so cancer cells are zombie cells that are no longer under your own body and they pretty much have their own brain where they can take over they invade different areas of inflammation and they can potentially kill you just like the white walkers normally in the immune system you have the natural killer cell over here on the na part of the immune system and then on the acquired you have the T killer cells that are specialist in attacking cancer cells this game or battle has been going on for a very long time the goal of our immune system is to kill the cancer cells and the cancer cells also have a goal of surviving and they can survive under various conditions they can survive under conditions where there no oxygen and sometimes they go into dormancy and come back out of remission even after chemotherapy so we have tried many things to try to kill off cancer but our best strategy is really to take care of our own immune system and make sure the natural killer cells and the t-cells are strong enough to prevent cancer from growing in the first place and then we had the red woman who is part of the fiery hand who uses the weapon of fire not to mention the pyromancers who specialized in fire and then we have individuals that use poison as their weapon as in the red Viper now in the immune system we have a very similar situation there inflammation which we could look at is fire which makes it very very hard for a pathogen to live and certain immune cells use these inflammatory type cytokines in their defense mechanism as well as using other poisons like bleach and hydrogen peroxide and another one called interferon which is a chemical that interferes with the viral reproduction so in the Battle of Blackwater a certain weapon was used to destroy the ship defenses now an immune system exact same thing happens you have viruses you have bacteria you have other microbes that literally have this strategy of turning down your receptors for vitamin D vitamin D is essential for your immune system to work but not if it off they also deplete your zinc which is also essential and your vitamin C so without these key nutrients your immune system is susceptible it to continued infection the faceless men can use the faces of people they kill to infiltrate the enemy and kill who they need to quietly Arya Stark learns this technique and puts it to good use now similar thing happens in the immune system so certain viruses and other microbes like mycoplasma nano bacteria have various strategies one of the strategies clean virus might use is to act as one of her own and be camouflage as one of our own cells so they can go undetected and enter the cell and create havoc other strategies that nano bacteria use which are very very small bacteria is to literally build a shell a calcium shell around them sort of like an igloo or like a little dome that they hide in and be protected another name for that is a biofilm so the immune system is a real hard time finding these microbes so the goal of any front line of defense is to hold the fort when Tyrion Lannister was fighting Stannis Baratheon at the Battle of the Blackwater Tyrion was about to lose the battle until the reinforcements finally arrived the battle is over where you have one so you can look at it like this the in a part of the immune system is the first line of defense the acquired another name would be adaptive is the second line of defense which normally takes between five and seven days so in this next scene we have Sansa Stark who finally identifies Littlefinger of her brother bran Stark to finally figure out who is the real instigator behind so many situations so in the immune system we have a similar thing immune cells work together so on the acquire side of the immune system we have the t killer cells which are the assassins like the special forces that do the killing okay and then you have the B cells which make antibodies B cells don they identify or tag the enemy so here a virus they put a little flag in there kill me so then the t killer cell can find the enemy and kill it alright guys so there you have it the comparison of Game of Thrones to the game of your own immune system between the Battle of pathogens and white blood cells thanks for watching with another amazing recipe no brains no sugar totally Kido there no care and it absolutely you have to check this out I think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it easy to be keto but is it simple it super simple we

The Tongue Can Determine a Vitamin C Deficiency	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1YLaPKNJx8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so let about him in C deficiency a major vitamin C deficiency like a subclinical scurvy type situation just from looking at the tongue so the name of this would be scorbutic tongue so you have a combination of glossitis which is a condition where the tongue is inflamed kind of shiny sometimes red with red blotches on the side through here and that hemorrhaging of the blood vessels and you can also see that in other parts of the body like the lower legs we lose these red purple spots and the reason for that is vitamin C is intimately involved in making collagen and it involved in connective tissue so the inside of your vascular system is all connective tissue so if you don enough vitamin C to make that that network everything falls apart and you start getting little areas of bruising and bleeding and little red spots and blotches and it can happen on the tongue anywhere in the body and so there other vitamin C deficiencies as well but realize a vitamin C deficiency starts off very very gradual and the more deficient you are the more symptoms you necessarily wait until you have all of these symptoms to do something about it but it does usually take about a month of not consuming vitamin C to have this show up and there that can create a deficiency by preventing the absorption of vitamin C so you may be consuming vitamin C or even taking it as a supplement but if you or you have high levels of sugar in your bloodstream because you can block your vitamin C levels why because the chemistry of vitamin C is very similar to sugar so if you consume them at the same time the sugars going to go in and the vitamin C will not so if you it not when you at a different time period and I very sarcastic because you don consume any sugar at all there are many other symptoms of a vitamin C deficiency one would be fatigued and that probably gonna be the first one you experience you have this lethargy you weak you arms or legs you might brush your teeth and notice there because the connective tissue in our collagen around the vascular part of your gums also you can experience bone pain you can also see this with a vitamin D deficiency bruising like we just talked about the vascular system and then there were these red and purple spots a lot of times you the lower legs especially in a diabetic I wonder why because sugar competes for vitamin C and they have high levels of sugar also because vitamin C is necessary to strengthen collagen tendons ligaments you may find that your teeth are loose here have higher levels of vitamin C citrus like lemon juice but it has to be raw because he destroys it peppers red peppers green peppers sauerkraut probably has the most vitamin C if you have a good sauerkraut you like 700 milligrams of vitamin C per cup I mean our RDA is for vitamin C it about 90 so you tremendous amount about M and C when you do sauerkraut the leafy greens salads Brussels sprouts broccoli all have vitamin C parsley is loaded with vitamin C and so is cabbage which well that how you make the sauerkraut right so there you have it if you want more information about vitamin C I put the video up right here that you need to watch next	Success
15 Signs of an Omega-3 Fatty Acid Deficiency	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDmw9WiUfcE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today I want to talk about all the things that could happen to you if you now typically when people think omega-3 they think fatty fish and that is absolutely true like salmon or sardines very very good sources of omega-3 but when you consume a fish that fish you omega-3 when you eat the meat but if you have Cobb liver oil okay which is a concentration of oil and their liver you omega-3 fatty acids as well as vitamin A and vitamin D so if we compare the cod liver oil to even salmon you getting additional benefit of vitamin A and vitamin D so I do recommend that two to three times a week you consume fatty fish or do some cod liver oil or seafood to get your omega-3 because if you deficient in omega-3 these are the 15 things that could happen to you you can develop rough scaly skin okay you can also develop dry skin as well as dermatitis which is kind of a general name for an inflammation of the skin and that can be Zima - all the way to psoriasis and everything in between if someone has dermatitis and they take omega-3 fatty acids usually you see a nice improvement where off the bat dry eyes could be another symptom dry hair age-related macular degeneration arrhythmias arrhythmias can develop from an omega-3 fatty acid deficiency fatty liver so you would think that consuming a fat that liver worse but no it actually makes it better especially if you right type of fab hypertension so an omega-3 fatty acid deficiency could increase the risk of hypertension also can increase the risk of angina as chest pain and an actual heart disease loss of memory dementia inflammation it could increase your risk of getting inflammation also muda sore like depression and even anxiety increasing your risk for getting allergies and ADHD so you can see the vital importance of omega-3 on the brain on the heart on the skin and on the eyes so if you want a little bit more information on this topic I put a video up right here check it out	Success
Heart Disease Starts When You Are a Kid	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXDqiZGkBZw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today I important topic and it has to do with arteriosclerotic changes or disease actually starting in young people now you wouldn this early but there interesting data I down below that discusses various changes in the coronary artery and even the aorta very early on and this data was acquired from several different areas one document included the deaths of young people and traumatic events observing that the arteries actually had the start of coronary heart disease another area was autopsies of 300 soldiers in the Korean War they found 77% had coronary heart disease in fact most 20 to 29 year olds had fatty streaks in their coronary artery as well as in the aorta which is a larger blood vessel now this may be hard to believe but in one paper I found some very interesting data of fatty streaks starting when you old I mean that is literally crazy but the fibrous plaquing usually starts in your 20s but here symptoms so the child the young adult has no clue what have no symptoms you an evaluation you test so a lot of data was discovered after these young people died and then evaluating an autopsy what now how can this be well I found some additional data I below and they factor and the most important risk factor is the insulin resistance okay and this comes from consuming too many carbohydrates so I did some more research and I found this study the diet and coronary heart disease study project in 1967 and this was the percent of macros back then for children and young adults 18 percent protein 40 percent fat and 42 percent carbs so at the time base assume that it was the fat that was causing it but we know now it carbs the percentage of carbs for a young adult should be 5% not 42 now even the American Heart Association is mentioning sugar and the reduction of that in children and young adults they said that you should consume no more than six teaspoons so the added sugar and we sugar that consume but the added sugar so now this is a better recommendation if we compare it to what the child normally consumes 19 teaspoons of sugar on average but this figure should really be zero teaspoons of sugar I mean if you think about what is an average blood sugar that the total amount of sugar in your blood which is a lot of blood should be no more than one level teaspoon okay that gives you a blood sugar of 82 so anything more than that is gonna be quickly removed from the blood and stored either as fat or cholesterol and so insulin is actually working really really hard depending on what happening in the blood with sugar so it data this connection of why a young person might have the beginnings of heart disease so early because we could just consuming too many carbs and those carbs create several mechanisms that destroy the inside of the vascular system so if you put an intro video up right here check it out	Success
The 3 Fats That Can Fix a Fatty Liver Â Reverse a Fatty Liver Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6kfGsAnV0w	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let have the potential to reverse a fatty liver so many people are freaked out about fat and they have this thing in their mind that if they ate any fat at all they reality what causes fatty liver is more the carbohydrates that are converting to fat but there are three fats that you can start consuming in larger amounts that will help reverse a fatty liver and i put some links down below for each one number one olive oil olive oil is an omega-9 fatty acid it beneficial to support a fatty liver don from olive oil or trying to have just a little bit use a good amount of it there other benefits to olive oil and i a link down below but i would recommend organic and extra virgin olive oil being the best all right number two fish oils i wild caught fish oils you can also do cod liver oil rich in omega-3 fish oils inhibit fat from accumulating on the liver and it can actually help reduce the fat in your liver as well it it retina it definitely good for your brain so make sure that you start consuming fish at least two to three times a week but make sure it and it wouldn quality fish oil or a cod liver oil all right last one is the virgin coconut oil can help reverse a fatty liver in rat studies now there studies but if you have a pet rat that has a fatty liver start feeding them some coconut oil make sure it now there to reduce fat on the liver and by the way having a fatty liver is very very common one way to know that you have it is just to look down if you have a gut you have a fatty liver but even if you don you the fat is around the organs you can quite see them sometimes it going to be crammed up inside the liver there purify bile salts is a really good remedy for a fatty liver you take one tablet after a meal number two choline excellent fat soluble nutrient that can help strip fat off the liver also cutting your carbs down and i talking about sugar and especially fructose because there nothing that will fatten up a liver faster than fructose okay number four fasting what happens when you fast both intermittently and periodic prolonged fasting is that you give your body a chance to reduce insulin and the body will then start to go after fat reserves in your liver and turn that into ketones so it tap in to the fat reserve finally because you insulin and then the amount of fat will get less and less and less so fasting is essential if you are really serious about getting rid of that fat in your liver thanks for watching hey we recipe no grains no sugar totally keto there suffering in keto absolutely not karen and it system builder absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it but is it simple it hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating it you	Success
How to Repair Your Immune SystemÂ if it is Old and Damaged	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdeBok0jOT0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so in this video I want to talk about how to repair an old weak damaged immune system when you age what happens is your immune system starts going downhill you have less natural killer cells that means you cannot eliminate viruses as well as you did when you you of the tumor cells as efficiently your b-cells go down so that means your antibodies go down so your immune system loses the memory so it doesn past pathogens so it so your immune system is a bit weaker also you lose your t-cells and that like a really really important part of your immune system with killing off microbes preventing autoimmune diseases decreasing inflammation after an infection and also the quantity of phagocytes won you just have less of these cells eating bacteria and cleaning up stuff so you can see that age really creates a huge impact on the immune system and so if you also like myself had a long history of taking antibiotics as a child or a teenager or adult that can greatly weaken your immune system as you get older and then if you have chemotherapy that just kills the immune system or steroids now this was me in my 20s I had really bad poison ivy every single season in the fall I would be exposed to poison ivy even if I didn it I could be three feet away and I would get poisoned I point where it even got in my eye at my face and so I had to take steroids every year I don years in a row so that created a weakness within my immune system so if you are on prednisone or had a history of taking steroids that can really suppress the immune system and not to mention pre-existing health problems that weakened immune system and also living under chronic stress can weaken the immune system now probably the most important thing that can strengthen your immune system is to be breastfed but if you happen anymore so next best thing is to take a supplement called colostrum okay this isn form and colostrum is very special in that it released and so it and other immune building factors and sovereign labs which is a really good company I I don very high quality colostrum and it a powdered form and it grass-fed cows organic and the version I would recommend is the colostrum LD this is a version of colostrum that they use with a special technology to encapsulate it in little lipid wrappers so it can pass through the acidity of the stomach and survive and so it more effective than other types of colostrum colostrum is rich in antibodies which greatly help your immune system it has lactoferrin which controls iron it has growth factors this is why a lot of athletes consume colostrum because they find that it can actually increase their performance in their their muscle mass and it can help them in overall strength but one of the biggest things the classroom does is help the intestinal permeability to prevent leaky gut and even if you have leaky gut it can actually help those junctions become really tight and strong to prevent pathogens from invading it so a lot of problems can occur if you have a leaky gut allergies autoimmune diseases so this is a very powerful remedy to support the internal layer of your intestines now I do want to mention one thing about colostrum is that if you do have a weakened immune system and you take too much of this you may turn on an immune reaction so I you take a very very small amount and then test the water so I 1/4 of a teaspoon okay just a little bit maybe a little water before you go to bed and see what happens because if you take a full spoon you might end up feeling a little groggy maybe a little mucus reaction maybe some immune reaction so start off very small and gradually increase it and if you have a reaction back off until that completely cleared up and then start back the fact that you have a reaction means that you need it you just need to take it in very tiny amounts at first some people might even need like 1/8 of a teaspoon if they alright number two acids we want to acidify the stomach we want to make sure the large intestine has lactic acid which will decrease the pathogens in the body because one thing that kills pathogens is acid and so in our stomachs we need how to chloric acid and our large intestine we need lactic acid so you chloride that stomach acid sea salt will help from the chlorides make sure you don that some other things that you can do is take fulvic acid which is really good for your system and also kombucha tea that would be very very beneficial and even probiotics like lactobacillus so then it can actually make the lactic acid that you need very important when you wipe out the flora the intestinal friendly bacteria you greatly diminish the immune system so that really important all right number three fermented foods can help with the immune system so start to consume things like sauerkraut kimchi very important prebiotics that would be like vegetable fibers that would be beneficial so your microbes have something to eat and then probiotics which I just mentioned I think anyone over the age of 60 should be taking a good probiotic okay number four fasting extremely powerful on the immune system I of a video I did on that but fasting can strengthen your immune system there even indications that you can literally rejuvenate a very weakened immune system by fasting on a routine basis and I talking about intermittent fasting but also periodic prolonged fasting alright were five sleeping because it increases melatonin melatonin is a very powerful hormone that can help your immune system so make sure that you do what you can to increase melatonin through sleep don take this as a sub though because over time your body can then resist that at number six of course the obvious lower carbs because the sugar weakens immune system most of the people that are dying from Cova 19 have metabolic diseases diabetes things that are related to carbohydrates and high insulin so you want to not just do ketone you want to do the healthy version of keto to make sure the quality of nutrients are there as well and then number seven very very important keep your stress as low as possible I telling you because if you stress date your immune system literally goes to sleep it becomes paralyzed it cannot work and then if you have grandkids or you having a baby make sure that you breastfeed that baby because breastfeeding is the most important thing to do for a long-term healthy immune system also exposing your child to germs very very important children that are not exposed to germs that live in this hyper clean environment don really develop your immune system so very very important and also don suppress the immune system if you actually get an infection a lot of times parents will start giving the child medication and aspirin and things right off the bat when they should probably let the child go through the infection and let the immune system recover because as soon as you start to like drop the fever with certain medications you actually prolong the infection and a weakened immune system all right there we have it how to repair an old damaged immune system with another amazing recipe no brains no sugar totally Cato there no care and it builder absolutely you have to check this

The Other Causes & Remedies for Hot Flashes & Menopause Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-9GzRP904g	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so let done quite a few videos and hot flashes from different angles so just to give you the basics we have this little gland in your brain called the hypothalamus and there hypothalamus that is controlling the release of the egg from the ovaries every month in your cycle so it controls the menstrual cycle and it works through this pituitary gland which is kind of like the middle map what happens is when you start menstruating let I don month you leasing an egg and roughly about 400 eggs you have okay so when you exhaust 400 roughly you should be around 52 years old and then your ovaries should stop working because you planning on getting pregnant and so you lose the ovarian function and with that comes a loss of certain hormones when you lose the ovary and it thank goodness you have a backup organ called the adrenals the adrenals make the same hormones as the ovaries just not in the same amounts the same quantities during menopause certain things can happen hot flashes night sweats anxiety depression stress muscle loss bone breakdown all these things can happen so there you can do to improve this whole thing typically the first thing I would tell people to do is to strengthen the back up organ the adrenals and there there do especially to make sure you sleeping make sure your stress is low because we want to reduce cortisol okay and I information on that and that may just solve the whole thing the major storage site for vitamin E is the pituitary so when you lose this cycle okay many times you can drop your vitamin E levels and vitamin E is needed for all these sex hormones so one remedy for hot flashes that is to take a very high quality vitamin E complex including all the took-off roles and all of the token renals together as one complex now the other thing that works for hot flashes is taking iodine from sea kelp why because this helps estrogen dominance now this is kind of strange because as you age estrogen should decrease it does but the other opposing hormone called progesterone really takes a nosedive so we have this relative severe progesterone deficiency with a moderate amount of deficiency with estrogen and if we look at that ratio it will give you an estrogen dominance and so there estrogen that countered it creates problems in this circuitry right here not to mention if you have extra body fat that body fat can then make more estrogen to after menopause and give you even more estrogen so taking iodine can really work if you have an estrogen dominant situation but there that also work for estrogen dominance so let purpose of the liver is to detoxify chemicals poison heavy metals and excess hormones it removes hormones if there an excessive amount of them as an estrogen dominance it will also remove excess amounts of cortisol there much but it can only do that if it working and the problem is when you reach age 50 too many times the liver is either fatty or it has problems and it just not working efficiently so another solution that really really is effective is to support the liver if you have hot flashes night sweats and issues because if we can get the estrogen to a normal level you can actually resolve the hot flashes and be able to sleep at night so there are pretty effective you can take cruciferous in a concentrated form or even cruciferous vegetables you know kale broccoli radish arugula things like that or dim which is a concentrated cruciferous you can get this in a supplement like one pill is equivalent to two pounds of broccoli so it compound to detoxify the liver but there called calcium D blue car eight your body makes a little of this but if the liver is not working you might need more you can get this as a supplement I don have a brand name to recommend you can just look in different products and read the reviews but what this compound does it estrogen and also ammonia if you if you consume too much protein one study it shows that it decreases estrogen by 23% and it will decrease the receptors for estrogen by nearly 50% right there it going to pull you out of this estrogen dominant situation it also increases the liver circulation with very minimal side effects if any so I just wanted to create this video to give you some options to look at if you have hot flashes and try different things thanks for watching with another amazing recipe no brains no sugar totally Kido there no care and it builder absolutely you have to check this out I think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it what is it simple it hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying idioms	Success
Bloating Causes: Bloated Belly After Exercise? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEqNkAfUC9U	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hi guys in this video we want to talk about a condition where you would get a bloated belly after you workout okay let all this and you end up with this stomach that it it could also happen after a stress event or let pushing your adrenals and also in the day it pregnant then you wake up and it smaller it of a swollen belly coming from an inflammatory State okay because cortisol is involved so let cortisol is the main adrenal hormone and it know people get a swell like a permanently swollen belly or belly fat that insulin as well but here confusion is this corn assault is normally an anti inflammatory hormone so why wouldn if you activated by some stress event or exercise and I think it the reasoning is because it works the same as insulin where you also have cortisol resistance I link down below more data on course or resistance but let situation when you have high level of stress over a long period of time or maybe it have this high levels of cortisol that then causes the receptor to be blocked so now the cortisol can inside the cell we have a low cortisol the feedback loops send a signal back telling the adrenal we don make more so cortisol resistance is a situation where course all doesn but the body is pumping out a lot of it at the same time so we have ineffective inefficient dysfunctional cortisol and because of that because the high levels being produced you get a lot of swelling after stress other condition conditions you may have would be poor immune system you might have a joint that gets swollen sinuses that get congested at night like it bunch of other symptoms but what you need to realize is that stress this is acting as a stress it stress to the body so you to change your workouts to more of a walking yoga low intensity type workout or if you do interval training you want to make sure they tiny workouts with lots of rest not the p90x or some type of intense type of workout where you yourself for an hour you don do that so you want to lower the intensity do things to improve the adrenal to the point where you can recover faster and faster and then it won alright thanks for watching hey if you haven little button down below okay thanks	Success
How to Boost Your Antioxidant Network	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cm-hpjK8gs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we antioxidants and how to boost your antioxidant levels now just so you know your body makes antioxidants okay they and also you can get them from your food or supplements that antioxidants now why are these antioxidants so important well because they actually neutralize something called free radicals and they neutralize oxidants that can oxidize and create a lot of problem in your body so they lessen the amount of damage in your cellular machinery including the DNA okay so if you have damaged DNA that is going to shorten your lifespan so you won get a disease develop cancer and also have a lot of other complications from the disease from all the collateral damage so an antioxidant basically donates one of its electrons to this free radical a free radical is an unpaired electron so if you envision this little plate spinning with two electrons that are nice and balanced but it only has one it it creating cellular damage your body will donate an electron to balance it out so this is no longer a free radical and it now that antioxidant becomes a free radical so what happens is it borrows electron from another antioxidant and so on and so on and this is why antioxidants are in networks and another reason why you should never buy and take a synthetic antioxidant like they have synthetic vitamin E or a if you taking those especially in higher amounts and thinking you benefits from the antioxidants realize that they antioxidants so when they donate the electron they themselves become a free radical so you in like whole complexes that come from food or just get them from food itself so one of the most powerful antioxidants your body has is glutathione and the liver and it here are some foods that can help provide the raw materials for that antioxidant high quality beef fish chicken definitely cruciferous vegetables radish is very high in sulfur garlic is very high in sulfur onion very high in sulfur spinach avocado asparagus all have massive amounts of antioxidants and selenium which is the most powerful trace mineral antioxidant you get that in Brazil nuts fish seafood sea kelp organ meats so you need certain trace minerals to help build up your antioxidant networks now antioxidants also are a part of the vitamin complexes so you know the scorebook acid is part of the vitamin c complex you have to cough rawls as the antioxidant part of the vitamin E now if I dominate of the beta carotene part which is the antioxidant vitamin D acts as an antioxidant b1 acts as an antioxidant and believe it or not ketones act as an antioxidant in your body I don uric acid uric acid is probably the most powerful antioxidant in the blood okay it protects their red blood cells from oxidizing but it also causes gout if it place so if your kidney is damaged and you the kidney properly it can end up in the big toe but I do want to say that out of all the antioxidants in your blood over 50% of those antioxidants are uric acid so uric acid does help you in certain ways uric acid is also vital in protecting the central nervous system it decrease the collateral damage that occurs in Parkinson even ms and even after you had a stroke even the structure called the hippocampus needs uric acid to protect it and so many people consuming a high carb diet for example are getting all this oxidation from the glucose which destroys hippocampus and their memory starts to go and also their spatial memory they can in time and space so they end up looking for their car where did I park my car and they have a very difficult time of finding things uric acid has some benefits as an antioxidant we have a couple things we can do we can start eating foods with higher amounts of antioxidants the cruciferous vegetables the vegetables in general I always recommend 7 to 10 cups per day some people can you can also take supplements like concentrated wheatgrass juice powder or garlic or onion there different antioxidants that you can take but just make sure they concentrated food not a synthetic version of an antioxidant some other things you can do keep your stress down because stress just oxidizes the body like crazy high levels of cortisol will basically destroy the body also getting enough sleep will increase your antioxidant Network exercise will stimulate more antioxidants in your body as an adaptive process but hands down the biggest thing that will increase your antioxidant Network is fasting intermittent fasting and periodic prolonged fasting when you fast your genes flip over into this survival mechanism and the body as a defense mechanism starts creating all these antioxidants in certain networks to increase your longevity and also parallel to that you have all these different repair actions that kick in so start doing repair so you have a protective aspect and you have repair even when people get cancer and they have to take chemotherapy fasting will increase the antioxidants will decrease the oxidative stress so oxidative stress is not having enough net work of antioxidants and having too much oxidation all right guys there you have it and thanks for watching hey with another amazing recipe no brains no sugar totally keto there suffering kita absolutely not Karen and it you have to

Natural Anti-Clotting Stroke Support	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjTYVmU32qQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	someone recently had a good question they had a stroke at one time and they wanted to prevent future strokes so they wanted to know what would I suggest so I wanted to do this video to talk about clots in general what they are what creates them and what you can do to prevent them so a clot or a coagulation is a group of cells that are kind of stuck together and they can circulate through the vessels and they get hung up in certain parts of the body if they get hung up in your heart you get a heart attack if they get hung up in the brain you get a stroke if they get stuck in the lung it pulmonary embolism and you can start having chest pain breathing problems and even cardiac arrest if they get stuck in the deep veins of your leg it deep vein thrombosis and that can cause pain redness lack of circulation a weakness but you can get clots stuck anywhere in the body liver and the kidney so in the body we have this balance of these clotting factors especially vitamin K and a lot of anti clotting factors that are working together to keep the blood at the right consistency but with a clot we dealing with fibrin which is a protein now there your risk of developing a clot and the big one is estrogen women that go through pregnancy have a higher risk of getting clots simply because the amount of estrogen and also the risk goes up if you estrogen replacement therapy another risk factor would be obesity in general that will double the risk if you diabetic the risk goes up but if you overweight a diabetic taking birth control pills and estrogen replacement therapy and you really really high the real big thing that increased your risk of getting strokes is if you have instant resistance which is behind obesity diabetes pre-diabetes but insulin resistance occurs long before you become a diabetic so you could basically have insulin resistance for 10 to 15 years and not even know it if you on your blood Sugar a lot of videos and insulin resistance I will put something down below if you new to it but it condition to know about and prevent if you have insulin resistance the enzymes that break down fibrin are diminished so you have decreased fibrinolysis you just don and your risk factors go up of developing clots and this is why people that have insulin resistance have an increased risk of getting a stroke alright what can you do about this well number one you can handle this right here be cautious of how much estrogen you often I obesity there do about that as well as diabetes but there remedies that you can take to really minimize the risk factor for getting a stroke first one is called Nadeau kinase this is an enzyme that is made from the fermentation of soybeans and it powerful blood thinner that will help keep your blood from clotting unnecessarily next one it bro kinase what is this another enzyme that is extracted from earthworms this too is a very powerful anti-clotting natural remedy with very minimal side effects then we have Sara peptides which is another powerful enzyme it helps to break down protein things that shouldn be in your body and it bacteria from silkworms bromelain is a good one as well this is from pineapples and this is very beneficial for the heart and it also has been known to decrease risk of stroke and then we have vitamin E which is a natural blood thinner and it does a lot of other things as well it antioxidant before you start taking any of these I would really have you focus on this with your diet how intermittent fasting then add these right here and then you better shape all right thanks for watching hey well back with another amazing recipe no brains no sugar totally Kido there absolutely not Karen and it system builder absolute leaves you have to check this out I think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it but is it simple it hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying audience	Success
What Vitamin D Does to Your Immune System	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvGH3kG5u4c	Dr. Eric Berg DC	well hello today we vitamin D in relationship to your immune system now I had this idea that I already had this video and I searched and I couldn there may be a video out that I just can just gonna do a video specifically on the immune system first thing you need to know is that vitamin D is intimately connected to every single immune reaction in fact the white blood cells have the ability to make vitamin D active so in vitamin E is very important in fact viruses as one of their strategies is to downgrade or turn off the vitamin D receptor so you can any more vitamin D because apparently they know that vitamin E is very very important and so that they thrive so vitamin D deficiencies occur when there in the winter why do you think we have the spike of flu and other viral infections it low in fact in the pandemic of 1918 a Spanish flu it peaked in January which is in the winter now another thing that months or basically between November and March we have much higher incidence of autoimmune diseases like lupus ms type 1 diabetes rheumatoid arthritis irritable bowel disease why because vitamin D is a natural kind of a steroid anti-inflammatory and so it has a key function in reducing inflammation when you have an autoimmune disease the thing that really creates the damage is the inflammatory process so if you have enough d you can have a lot less inflammation it the collateral damage and what about this is our own body is creating damage and so that really bizarre vitamin D is a immuno modulator okay what does that mean modulator it means that it helps to normalize something that is too much or too little so it brings into a normal range and specifically when we talk about like the cytokine storm where you have this hyper inflammatory condition we have this overreaction vitamin D can actually calm it down the ki cell that suppressing this these cytokines or these inflammatory compounds is the T regulatory cell next thing we about is there immune system makes as anti microbials and both of these need vitamin D vitamin D is essential in producing these two compounds the first one is called catalase side ins and cathal aside ins are produced by the phagocytes macrophages and neutrophils to act as a weapon to kill off microbes and they tend to damage the wall of the cell the cellular membrane of the pathogen and punch a hole in it and if there enough vitamin D you much inflammation and when side effect would be psoriasis many times people with psoriasis have gut problems and they can case they need to take higher doses next chemical is defense in you need vitamin D to make defensive defense and is needed in the mucous membranes breast milk has defensin it antimicrobial if you don D this can also get out of control and it can create rosacea another remedy for rosacea which is like the reddish cheeks vitamin D now before antibiotics doctors used a vitamin D compound in cod liver oil as the remedy to help infections like TB for example so cod liver oil was used son was recommended for TB but then it came antibiotics and then the cod liver oil was no longer talked about except by your grandmother cod liver oil is a really good source of vitamin D and vitamin A for the mucous membranes and omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA but the Sun not only gives you vitamin D but it has other properties too that can help lower infection there are therapeutic benefits from the UV light and other wavelengths including infrared I just want to give you an overall understanding of the importance of vitamin D and also let you know that it vitamin D from food you need to get it from Sun ideally and during the winter months take it as a supplement see you in the next video with another amazing recipe no brains no sugar totally Kido there absolutely not Karen and it system builder absolutely you have to check this out I think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it but is it simple it hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating	Success

Natural Ways to Raise Dopamine Levels Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0H_EMV28Hg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hi guys in this video we talk about how to raise something called dopamine dopamine is what motivational molecule because it actually improves your motivation your get-up-and-go your ability to jump out of bed so when you you can focus you lose your cognitive function become depressed at anxiety apathetic feet and hands get cold decrease libido mental sluggishness carb cravings other than that you there will trigger dopamine as well like crack cocaine for example little baby right here it person gets hooked and addicted to crack what triggering this neurotransmitter which is elevating the your mood and different cognitive functions temporarily gibble me and then what happens is the more you do it the more you lose the effect the more that you want to do it so you because it needs more and more cocaine to stimulate the same amount of dopamine so you become very very addicted and of course what it giving you this artificial sensation which then gives you the need for more and more of it so it now the other thing is if you consume caffeine for example or any type of stimulants what you triggering dopamine over and over and over again and then you you do it over time you lose that effect so you need more and more coffee more and more stimulants to create the same effect just like any drug so let talk about what dopamine is it neurotransmitter okay neural transmitters are similar to hormones in that their communication particles yet the neurotransmitters communicate to the nervous system where about hormones communicate through the blood okay that would be the difference okay so there are things that you can do to stimulate the production of dopamine like taking l-tyrosine as an amino acid which is a precursor because maybe you need more raw material or improving the stomach acids so you can break down the proteins to formulate this neurotransmitter those are some things and by the way the way that you would know that you wouldn have enough stomach acid is if you would have gas indigestion or bloating okay then you vinegar something like maybe something like patanè hydrochloride just to increase the acidity so you can make more of this neurotransmitter on a flipside you also have reducing stress too much stress in cortisol will nullify the production of dopamine okay and this is actually really really important so you would want to maybe take some B one from nutritional yeast but let example you have a history of being a drug addict and you really bad state right now and you want to spike it up there called cell Butte to mean so yes it and if you use it on a temporary basis it but just make sure that you take it in a blend of nutritional yeast so therefore you factors any time you take excessive amounts of a certain isolated synthetic vitamin you can deplete the other vitamins that normally come and that complex and this goes for vitamin C vitamin B vitamin E across the boards rhodiola is another herb to help decrease stress holy basil is another one that as well and the next thing is to reduce sugars okay because what that does is it sets up a situation that you get insulin resistance insulin resistance is a situation when you can amino acids to make the neurotransmitters so you would have to fix this insulin resistance to be able to have this work and everything else is not going to work unless you fix that point because it door that allows everything to go in there to kick it in and make it work correctly and there can take to actually improve dopamine levels and it okay it nutritional yeast but it for cognitive issues helping to stimulate more dopamine but if I were you I would take a nutritional yeast by itself that way you can actually get this right here and the b1 and actually improve that situation okay lastly get more Sun more Sun will improve the dopamine levels as well alright thanks for watching hey if you haven button below and I will keep you in the know hey that runs	Success

How to Increase Your Vitamin D Absorption?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zqatJkyhPU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	we want to talk about how to increase the absorption of vitamin D it just a matter of just taking more vitamin D or just getting a little Sun and there to increase the absorption because vitamin D can greatly help with inflammation with your mood with insomnia with sleep apnea okay and autoimmune type of conditions and skin issues now one really simple thing you can do is press on your breast bone this bone right here the sternum and see if there shouldn okay and then you can press on your shin which is in the front part of your lower leg and if there that could be about a mini deficiency one really interesting thing I used to do my clinic is I would have people test for that and then have them take some vitamin d3 and wait for 30 minutes that pain is gone completely gone so you might want to try that it simple way to see if you have a pretty good vitamin D deficiency because one of the big symptoms is bone pain not just necessarily hip pain but when you press on the bone it hurts so vitamin D is an anti-inflammatory first thing is are you getting enough Sun get outside expose your body more to the Sun if you have a mutation or a genetic issue which a lot of people have and they don testing that you can get done on that you seem to take more vitamin D to create the effect because the vitamin D receptor is blocked and so the vitamin D doesn overcome that with higher amounts I did create a video to talk about if you taking high dosages of vitamin D what other things you must do to prevent for other problems like with hypercalcemia higher calcium in the blood there whole series of things you can do I created a video on that I down below but it might be a good thing to watch that just because you want to take vitamin k2 you may not want to take calcium like dairy when you the vitamin D because we don increase more but calcium in the blood if we therapy but zinc helps absorption of vitamin D vitamin A is really important in vitamin D and this is why Cobb liver is so important because cod liver has a nice balance 50/50 of vitamin A and vitamin D with omega-3 which also helps you absorb vitamin D so cod liver oil has vitamin D vitamin A the two versions of cacao mega 3 DHA and EPA so it really they all work together magnesium helps you in the absorption of vitamin D it also will help regulate calcium as well vitamin D also can help absorb more magnesium as well not just calcium in the small intestine vitamin D is made from cholesterol so if you go in a low cholesterol diet or a low fat diet you could starve off the raw material to make vitamin D or even give you about a minute so the cholesterol is in your skin and your body then can convert it from the Sun so we don cholesterol and by the way in certain drugs that actually block vitamin D and statin would be one of them because statin blocks cholesterol show you about how many levels plummet well guess what you pain one of the big side effects from statin is muscle pain probably because also you to make steroid hormones too and the muscles kind of go downhill when you take vitamin D you should take it wet while you it because it you lower your stress you the absorption of vitamin D because high stress blocks the vitamin D probiotics are important because they help to recycle the bile from that the gall bladder 95% of all the bile is recycled over and over and over again so it need the bile to extract vitamin D from the food that you all right bile salts taking bile salts when you help the extraction of vitamin D from your food intense exercise can help increase the absorption of vitamin D boron which is a trace mineral can help vitamin D and help your bone formation it also is good for increasing testosterone vitamin k2 is really important with d3 because they both work together in the balancing out of calcium if you don calcium tends to settle into the wrong places the soft tissue like the arteries vitamin D doesn anywhere it just increases it in the blood and by the way it will lower your blood pressure too but if you take k2 we drive it into the bone where it should be and take it out of the joints and put it into the bone but k2 is also really really important in improving your endurance when you exercise so it helps the output of energy from the mitochondria anyway here things you can do to increase the absorption of vitamin D I next video so if you ahead and share it with someone that could really benefit from it	Success
Why Does Potassium Work for Hypertension? High Potassium Foods for High Blood Pressure Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFHdl8B0_AI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so in a few of my videos I talk about the relationship between potassium and blood pressure but I had someone recently asked why does potassium help lower blood pressure and that this video is about just some quick background information only 2% of the population and I Americans get enough potassium 2% that means 98% of Americans are deficient they just not getting enough most of them don need about 4700 milligrams a day to achieve the RDAs for potassium and I not talking about bananas because bananas only have about 300 milligrams so you to achieve this and then the problem with that is all the sugar that comes along with it but mostly you get your potassium from leafy greens certain vegetables the problem with that is an average American only consumes one and a half cups of veggies per day when they actually need about 7 to 10 cups but realize when I 10 cups I lettuce I concentrated like broccoli for example or cauliflower this would be for leafy greens so if you more dense maybe you do four four cups something like that and also if you chop this up and cut this down this is gonna come down a lot less because you actually making it more dense but the point is that the more vegetables that you eat the closer you this amount you can also get potassium from fish and some meats and nuts and it definitely avocados that source most people just don potassium from their diet also when you consume refined carbohydrates both in grain carbohydrates and sugars you deplete your potassium even more when you potassium when you take a diuretic you deplete your potassium there different ways that people end up being deficient in potassium if we take a look at sodium the opposing mineral 90 percent of a mare raccoons are consuming too much of sodium so we sodium very light on the potassium and what this creates is a situation where your blood pressure is going to start going higher and higher and higher potassium in general has a diuretic effect it potassium causes the smooth muscle in your arteries to dilate it vasodilator thus lowering the blood pressure also potassium keeps the vascular system from being stiff because if your arteries are stiff that alone can cause hypertension either increase the foods that are high in potassium which I that or take potassium as a supplement or an electrolyte powder and you gonna find that your blood pressure is gonna start coming down now the other cause of hypertension is low vitamin d3 so if you take vitamin d3 and potassium or get it from the food you will find that your blood pressure should be coming down the other thing I mention about potassium is it also lowers the risk of getting a stroke and the way that that occurs is that potassium directly affects the consistency of blood it reduces clotting as in blood clots potassium can kill two birds with one stone of course that not the best analogy but it can actually help reduce hypertension and decrease the risk for a stroke with another amazing recipe no brains no sugar totally Cato there no care and it builder absolutely to half each other health I think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it what is it simple it hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating	Success
Vitamin E Reverses a Fatty Liver Â Detoxify Fatty Liver Disease Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZRWkboolT4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so in this video we about why you would want to take vitamin E if you had a fatty liver so there condition called Nash non-alcoholic steatohepatitis so what does this word mean right here well a Patou means liver and stato means relating to fat fat in a cell or fat in your liver and then we have itis inflammation of this word would relate to a fatty liver that has some inflammation i think of Nash like a fatty liver that inflamed there are several very credible studies that were done with vitamin E on Nash because medically they don what to do about it they don ketogenic diet low carb they don recommend fasting which would really help this condition if you look this up there for vitamin E vitamin E has demonstrated significant improvement in steatosis which is the fatty liver portion inflammation and ballooning of the hepatocyte which is the liver cell and basically what this means is that the liver cells have degenerated and they dying the vitamin E has the power to reduce the fat inflammation and the death of the liver cells in adult patients with nash that don diabetes or cirrhosis if you have cirrhosis or diabetes I would still recommend this but I would also recommend several other things too which I want more information about that it roughly at least eight parts to the vitamin E complex you have four different decaf Rawls and four different tocotrienols what they used is the natural version of only one of the two Corral antioxidant but of course I would recommend the whole complex why just give one part of a vitamin E complex and they used 800 international units now there are other studies that I down below that used up to a thousand and some other studies that used only 400 but I think between 800 and thousand would be a good idea vitamin e stops the transition from going from the fatty liver to an inflamed liver it powerful antioxidant and if you think about it there radical damage going on vitamin E can actually calm that down and put out the fire and prevent this inflammation as well as prevent the fibrosis that happens after that as well just by taking vitamin E and not changing your diet probably is not going to change this that significantly it may a little bit but if you actually change your diet and you cut out the carbs that are causing this right here it fat in the liver especially high fructose corn syrup by doing the healthy version of the ketogenic diet with in a minute fasting and then if you actually add vitamin E on top of that gotta be like the icing on the cake well maybe I shouldn but if you also add vitamin C which is another powerful antioxidant and a food complex with choline I think you a really good complete program if you want additional information about a fatty liver I have quite a few videos I here check them out	Success
20 Things that Result in Mineral Deficiency Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwaBFUDB5RQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so we that keep you deficient in minerals okay and some trace minerals first of all the soils the soils just don minerals the farmers don minerals back in especially the trace minerals which are minerals needed in smaller amounts like selenium iodine zinc very important number to anti acids they block certain minerals especially calcium and by the way if you any acids for heartburn or GERD you have number three which is low stomach acids low stomach acid will cause the opening of the valve on top of the stomach to allow the acid to go through you need a real strong acidic stomach to prevent the regurgitation of that acid but low stomach acids will block the absorption of magnesium zinc calcium iron and a lot of other minerals too so you need a real acidic stomach to pull these minerals in the way that you know you have low stomach acid is if you have gas and an inability to digest meat okay and before chorus sound like like a medication prednisone of steroids that will deplete your potassium Reserve that synthetically medications will deplete your minerals there medications that will deplete different minerals but like I diuretics for example will deplete your potassium levels number six birth control pills will deplete you a magnesium and zinc coffee in excess will deplete calcium magnesium potassium and sodium basically all the electrolytes number eight soda soda has a lot of phosphorous and that depletes the calcium in the body as well as the potassium now sugar depletes potassium magnesium chromium and zinc number 10 high levels of insulin will block not just minerals but vitamins specifically potassium and magnesium and chromium number 11 if the thyroid is in a hyper mode you calcium magnesium and selenium number 12 stress which activates your own natural cortisone will deplete calcium and potassium and B vitamins like b1 b5 number 13 grains grains have something called phytic acid which prevents the absorption of minerals okay and then if you consume refined grains as bread or pasta in a state of flour you lose the B vitamins and potassium and calcium and that enriched grains with certain synthetic vitamins but they don the minerals number 14 ox let calcium oxalate stones in the kidney well what happens it locks up the calcium in the body and so you become calcium deficient believe it or not if you have a tendency to get a kidney stone it calcium because you deficient and it digestive system it won the kidney and bind to the oxalate so it actually will help you number 15 not consuming enough vegetables well what food gives you all the minerals you got it large quantities of vegetables number 16 not consuming enough sea vegetables like seaweed or sea kelp or even sea food because that so if you and you grown close to the ocean you could become iodine deficient just from that being pregnant it can create major deficiency because the demand for nutrients is so high and the problem with a lot of women that are pregnant they vitamins synthetic prenatals with the minerals that are like rocks they going to absorb them you want to do plant base you want to go high quality of nutrients when you number 18 being a vegan you really have to know what you become a vegan or a vegetarian because there difficult to get one is iron okay 19 having mercury exposure can deplete you of magnesium and calcium amalgam fillings number 20 led okay if you will be calcium deficient so now you know all the potential ways that you could become deficient and mineral thanks for watching if you haven the button below and I will keep you in the know hey that rhymes	Success
Autonomic Neuropathy: Common Underdiagnosed Problem	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyetHtHIWx8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we common yet under diagnosed condition autonomic neuropathy now what does autonomic neuropathy mean neuropathy means nerve damage and with autonomic we the nervous system that system which controls things automatically which is a combination of the flight or fight stress response and the parasympathetic nervous system which is rest or digest and the enteric system which is another system that can control your digestive system that part of the nervous system is on automatic and you don anything it just works on its own as in bladder control cardiovascular system control i mean you don it just automatically works digestion and genitals you may have heard a condition called peripheral neuropathy where you have damage to the peripheral nerves on the bottom of your feet or your hands those are the sensory nerves that get damaged from conditions like diabetes for example where your hands or feet get numb like a burning sensation or even severe pain and here cause of this condition is diabetes but if you think about it you don overnight it gradually goes from high insulin to insulin resistance to pre-diabetes to eventually a diabetic right well you don condition overnight either it gradually occurs so you may have one or more of these symptoms and that could be the beginning of this condition i do something about it before you end up with this condition just because you weren doesn blood sugar issue another cause of this could be some type of autoimmune condition to part of the nervous system or maybe even a virus but diabetes is number one on the list so let symptoms urinary retention a lot of people have this symptom but they never connect the dots with it being connected to maybe a pre-diabetic state or even a blood sugar problem number two hypertension we know diabetics usually have high blood pressure at some point well now we know why then you have number three abdominal pain or achiness and that can show up in kind of an uncomfortable feeling in your abdominal area number four malabsorption this is a real big one you may not feel this but it might show up in nutritional deficiencies which is a whole other series of symptoms number five gastroparesis this is simply a condition where your digestive system is very sluggish it snail well guess what that coming usually from this or a pre-diabetic state number six constipation a very common symptom number seven sleep apnea number eight abnormal sweating that could be either your body is too dry or you sweat too often so many people have an abnormal sweating situation either they don sweat enough or they sweat too much number nine orthostatic hypotension this occurs when you stand up and you get really dizzy your blood pressure drops too low another name for this would be pots all right number 10 arrhythmias so that would involve the cardio as far as having autonomic neuropathy of the genitals that can range from pain to just lack of function of those organs what can be done about this condition there that i would recommend benfotamine which is a fat-soluble b vitamin which works really good on peripheral neuropathy but it also is effective in all types of neuropathy especially if it or pre-diabetes and alpha lipoic acid both of these act as a very powerful antioxidant to repair not only the free radical damage that but both of these are fat soluble and they support the myelin sheath around the nerve which is the protecting part the effectiveness of this in this i believe is dependent on if you doing keto intermittent fasting because this gets at the the root of this problem right here but these two right here would be two really good recommendations for this condition all right thanks for watching hey we recipe no brains no sugar totally keto there suffering in keto absolutely not karen and it absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it to be keto but is it simple it hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating it	Success

Excessive Thirst Causes and Remedies Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmwNw89bl6o	Dr. Eric Berg DC	alright so in this video we we excessive thirst okay now the first thing I want to say is that a lot of people are drinking water just out of a habit either they a lot of water it they thirsty and that could be a problem if you more you develop something called hyponatremia which is a situation where you have low sodium in the body think about this when you electrolytes and without salt you actually diluting sodium so you creating a sodium deficiency and that can set you up for all sorts of issues so number one just drink when you thirsty okay and of course if you exercising you lot more number two and this is probably the most common reason why someone has excessive thirst they have diabetes or they sugar issues because they have insulin resistance realize this wherever the sugar goes the water follows so if you have all this sugar in your body and it it then it be filtered out guess what water you have either diabetes or you consuming a lot of sugar typically what more water and that something in your brain that tells you to drink more diabetics are usually thirst here and they we okay there called insipidus this is a situation where you all the time especially for like cold water or ice water and you lot and that could be very damaging to the body because you really dehydrated but this mechanism is different than this right here this could be a problem with a tumor in your pituitary gland it could be a problem with the kidney it mechanism number three if you potassium let don them you don taking a potassium supplement that alone can cause excessive thirst and of course if you have high sodium in the diet I saw diet low potassium you gonna be a lot more thirsty and also if you sodium as in monosodium glutamate and that potassium and sodium work together and usually if you you have low potassium you higher ratio of high sodium and the combination of both of these are gonna give you more of a sensation of thirst number five certain drugs will create excessive thirst diuretics especially steroids psych drugs and there others number six if you have higher amounts of calcium in the blood it called hyper calcium yeah this condition will trigger similar effects to diabetes excessive thirst as well as increase urination one rare cause would be having cancer or you may have what hyperparathyroidism with parathyroid gland you have four of them they located right behind the thyroid if there that can create a situation when your calcium goes up if you lithium of that can cause high calcium if you amount of vitamin D that potentially could cause high amounts of calcium but realize that you would have to take probably over a hundred thousand I use a vitamin D over a good amount of time it normal doses of vitamin D and I put some information down below if you concerned about that because sometimes people think if you 20,000 IU D that it data on that so this is what you need to do drink when you you diet but not to overdo it one teaspoon would be sufficient you put that within your meal through the day and then you the amount of carbohydrates in the diet the more salt that you need okay also having a low carb diet help you with the thirst why is that because higher amounts of carbohydrate turn into this which caused this and lastly having enough potassium in your diet that will create more hydration and help balance out the sodium and reduce the thirst alright thanks for watching and I video so I just spent the last two months creating this amazing course called how to bulletproof your immune system and there to give you this course for free and the problem I have with giving it free is sometimes people don but I want to get it out there so I just gonna give it to you free and I want to let you know that it extremely valuable right now we situation of uncertainty they about a second wave and other people are waiting for this miracle vaccine that maybe say who knows it what is the big elephant in the room no one is talking about the immune system they important thing that you can do to bulletproof yourself against viruses and bacteria this course is going to lay out things in 21 different lessons I teach you very simply what your immune system is and exactly what you can do to strengthen it using natural things there are three requirements number one I want you to share it very very widely can you imagine if thousands of people had this information to protect themselves but not only that

Best Way to Tell Arsenic Poisoning	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzqzY69wbQ8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so in this video i want to show you the best way to identify arsenic poisoning okay through the nails there the greek word for leuco means white and then anki is the nail luka nikiya is basically a horizontal white band on your nails and that can be arsenic poisoning but there are many other symptoms as well one would be headache confusion severe diarrhea because your body is trying to get rid of it drowsiness you have blood in the urine hair loss cramping stomach pain your skin is darkening your skin is getting thicker night blindness which mimics a vitamin a deficiency because arsenic depletes your vitamin a vitamin b1 deficiency because arsenic blocks the absorption of vitamin b1 and that will give you a whole series of additional symptoms an increase of hydrogen peroxide that can affect the color of your hair and you you can actually go gray and even convulsions and other than that you good now a couple reasons why you may have arsenic poisoning one is you rice has been found to have high levels of arsenic also you could get it from your water supply there around the world where there contamination of arsenic in the water supply and you know even thousands of people in certain areas are are becoming exposed to it and also there have been tested positive for arsenic probably because of contamination with the water that the plant pulled it in you have the pollution or the byproduct for arsenic from manufacturing things like that but then you also have arsenic in the soil as a natural occurrence you also have fluoride you have mercury cadmium you have a lot of different heavy metals what happens is the plant will absorb the minerals and heavy metals okay because every single plant has very very small amounts of these heavy metals that are considered toxic in large amounts and i just want to mention that when you get a trace mineral product that is plant-based you the heavy metals and i just want to mention that the chemistry of the or how that heavy metal is bound in a plant versus in the soil is very very different on a plant you have the chemistry as organic minerals okay in soil it organic that i as like without pesticides the other definition of organic is that it plant-based chemical bond that greatly reduces the toxicity but if you industrial byproduct that growing on especially arsenic then that plant can have very high levels of arsenic so even though it may be an organic chemical bond because it going to be a lot more toxic because of the concentration but typically if we high amounts of a certain heavy metal it suspect that you have arsync poisoning you could actually get a hair analysis to pick it up there other tests that you can do you can get a blood test the detox remedies for arsenic poisoning that i would recommend would be blue blue-green algae because it out certain heavy metals selenium will also help to detoxify arsenic if you haven seen my other video in arsenic i put it up right here check it out	Success
What is Epstein Barr Virus (EBV)? - Symptoms & Treatment Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KaCzadDRuA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hi guys I wanted to do a video on epstein-barr virus okay so it interesting because ninety percent of the population adult population has been infected with epstein-barr virus now the thing about viruses they they wrapped in a sac that can get activated when your resistance is lowered okay so the initial infection can create fever fatigue inflamed throat swollen tonsils and enlarged spleen enlarged liver I remember having Epstein Barr when I was in high school it was like really bad it was all in my throat and they call it the kissing virus because it spread by saliva so then over time there virus and chronic fatigue syndrome fibromyalgia hypothyroidism rheumatoid arthritis Hodgkin the way also is caused by GMO glyphosate stomach cancer ms autoimmune conditions like lupus or Sjogren to mosquito bites and the list goes on and on and on but what that there latency which means the ability of a virus to lie dormant so you get this initial infection and then it goes in remission it sits there it doesn anything it just waits until it activated so what this virus is once it gets reactivated okay only portions of the epstein-barr virus genes are expressed so you can have this initial infection but later in life you may only have like fatigue kick in or achiness in the muscles or any other additional things that can weaken your immune system to set you up for getting an autoimmune disease so the real question is what are the triggers that would reactivate this virus that is dormant nutritional deficiencies and stress okay but I believe stress is the right here because so many people they dresser let something and boom they end up with an autoimmune disease in fact when I talked to people over the last twenty nine years many people that had autoimmune I asked them when did it start and what happened just before and one one for one it was either a loss or a major stress that activated the whole thing and brought this virus out of remission activating certain genes that then lower the immune system setting them up to get an autoimmune disease okay so that real common mechanism so the question is what can you do about it okay well what you want to do is you want to support the gland that involved with stress that would be the adrenal gland focus on supporting the adrenal glands do things to improve it you know get more sleep go for long walks do techniques to pull stress out of your body selenium is very very important magnesium is very important boron the mineral trace mineral boron is very important in helping put this virus back in remission there called mono Lauren which is a made from coconut oil which is really good for viruses as well so these are some things that you can do but I think the biggest thing you do whatever you can to lower the stress change your environment to the point where that stress is no longer in the environment and that help put this thing back in remission and chill these symptoms out right here because these really are symptoms of this virus or at least part of the virus activation all right so I put some links down below for some additional things you can do to actually help the stress thanks for watching hey if you enjoyed this video press subscribe and I will definitely keep you updated	Success
Do This Before Your Detox: IMPORTANT	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHSvt25dj7w	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so if you you definitely need to do something first before you start the detox to event the detox reactions another name for detox reactions would be a herxheimer reaction so you have like the flu-like symptoms headache you feel sick and i experienced that many many times because i of different cleanses let me just kind of explain what happens when you detox there way you want to balance your detox because when you start taking things certain herbs to purge poisons from the body or kill microbes let you want to kill a parasite a bacteria you want to inactivate viruses or even break up biofilms which are little these little shells that these bacteria hide in and you want to break that up right what happens is that when the bacterial cell breaks open a lot of times it an endotoxin okay and that create an immune reaction one interesting thing that an endotoxin will do it flow through the liver and through the bile ducts in other words it causes a condition called cholestasis where you have a stagnant flow of bile in the liver and bile if it is very toxic to the liver actually can create a lot of inflammation it out through the bile ducts so what happens is you can get a backup of toxins in the blood and you immune reactions like even a fever it reduces the glutathione which is supposed to protect you from all the free radical damage and the oxidation that so you something great by a detox but you actually creating more damage now normally you have different phases of detoxification phase one phase two phase three and you have this poison that being released or comes through the body and then your body breaks it down into a harmless water soluble particle but phase three is all about the elimination of the toxin through the bile ducts and out through the small intestine the endotoxin shuts down the bile flow which also reduces phase two and phase three so we just have this backup of toxic waste in the body and this will definitely create right quadrant pain now it could be either underneath the rib cage through here or through the right side through here it can actually refer to the upper right shoulder right here it could also be tenderness and bloating that would be the sensation you can feel nauseous okay there will be stool changes the stool will float because you don enough bile to break down the fats so your stool is fattier you may feel itchiness in your palms or the feet especially at night you can have vision changes simply because without bile you absorb the vitamin a for the eye and that can actually change your vision or even alter the eye in a certain way and creating dry eyes as well and the urine typically will be a little bit darker because you bilirubin that and filtered through the kidney simply what do you do all you do is you take purified bile salts 30 minutes before you take this herbal detox get the bowel flowing then take the detox and then all the stuff will get through you so you can even then take purified bottle salts about an hour later as well but the key is just to make sure that your bile ducts are open you and there and then if you start to notice more of this reaction just take a little bit more and that should turn off those symptoms if you want more information about bowel salts i put a link down below thanks for watching hey we recipe no grains no sugar totally keto there suffering in keto absolutely not karen and it system builder absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it but is it simple it hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating it you	Success

Will Eating Less Slow Down Metabolism?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftijsgu6yb8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I wanted to answer will eating too little damage my metabolism so let doing fasting or then when you eat you calories and it it your metabolism down and this person also mentioned that they were told that small frequent meals will stoke the metabolism you know it going you need to eat every three hours okay which is completely not true at all if you really depends on what insulin because what metabolism or a stuck setpoint where you can lose weight but you can get below a certain point as higher levels of insulin specifically what creating at is insulin resistance and that lot of refined carbohydrates or just eating too frequently if you have insulin resistance you have higher amounts of insulin okay in the background the doctor never checks it they it right off the bat but the high insulin is the hormone that prevents your weight loss so if we want to fix the metabolism we need to fix this right here we need to fix this right here and guess what fasting corrects insulin resistance now does a low calorie diet correct insulin resistance it depends what you eat are you doing carbs yes or no if you doing yes then this low calorie diet is going to not correct this it not fix your metabolism and then the other point too is your nutrients like even when you eat a meal if it you will not destroy the metabolism your metabolism is also about how many nutrients you high nutrient dense meal or is it just something called dirty Kido where you not really paying attention to nutrients because sooner or later certain parts of your body are going to be deficient in these nutrients and that to slow the metabolism down it to slow the thigh right down now you could do low calorie diet with supplying all the nutrients and not effective metabolism but typically the way that a person destroys our metabolism is they just do a series of diets usually low calorie or low fat whatever that are very high in carb and low in nutrients if you do that repetitively you end up with a very slow metabolism they might do low fat popcorn or fruit or low fat snacks and end up with this right here and a really slow metabolic rate if you have a slow metabolism this is what you need to know right here the way that you lower your metabolism to correct this is number one fasting and number two keep your carbs low and number three keep your nutrients high alright thanks for watching hey with another amazing recipe no brains no sugar totally keto there absolutely no care and it system builder absolutely to half the chatter so I think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it what is it simple it hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating	Success
Why Your Muscles Need Most of Your Potassium	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2ZpRmIfr8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we your muscles need most of your potassium now what very unique about potassium is that it tremendous amount of we need 4700 milligrams and out of all the tissues in the body eighty percent is needed by your muscles mainly question is why do we need so much and why is it going to the muscles but before i explain that i need to explain something called the sodium potassium pump okay you have billions of these little pumps and what they do is they keep potassium on the inside of the cell and they keep sodium outside the cell so that purpose and the reason for that is anytime you have two different minerals that are held apart like that by a pump and by a membrane the cell wall you create a battery which is this you have positive negative held apart that flow of electrons that current generates a certain amount of energy that is stored in the battery well your cells are mini batteries in fact your brain has about 80 billion mini battery cells potassium is needed as a raw material to make sure this pump works in fact 30 of all the energy that you have in your body is allocated to this one little pump and because this pump allows two potassium in and three sodium out and that difference creates a voltage if we the muscle we millivolts in a nerve it in the skin it voltage is just the power of this battery created by the difference between these two minerals held apart and another term for that is called membrane potential because when it but then it gets activated and it starts releasing this electrical charge that then causes the muscle to contract and it creates nerve impulses and it causes glands to secrete like hormones or even like sweat glands the same principle happens in the thunderstorm where you have these clouds that have a positive charge and the earth is negative and when those clouds start building up moisture at a certain humidity you start generating a tremendous amount of electrostatic energy and when that electrical field gets to a certain point it will discharge the energy as a thunderbolt giving off 3 million volts per meter so that that is discharged the same thing in the cell you have the cell wall on the outside you have positive the inside you have negative and you have a very very thin membrane okay it nanometers of course this is a very large distance right here this is very very tiny but the cell wall or membrane is two layers of lipids or fats that keep these two minerals apart and once the muscle is activated to contract or the nerve is activated to send an impulse you lose potassium the more exercise you the more you the more you electrolytes if you or go through a surgery or trauma you will lose potassium when the thyroid works it you and also when you consume more refined sugar you will also lose potassium as well the other question is are we losing as much sodium no not necessarily because sodium has a tendency to be retained in the body but we do lose way more potassium and this is why this is a requirement right here as far as the sodium requirement it half what we need as far as potassium when you do fasting your body will have a tendency to retain more potassium just as a survival mechanism so that reasons why we have most of our potassium 80 in the muscles and then when our potassium becomes low the muscles become weak you get tired you don endurance anymore when especially when you exercise and your muscles start to cramp if you haven potassium i put them up right here check it out you	Success
Fascinating Interview with Dr. Chris Knobbe on Vegetable Oils and Macular Degeneration	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxCL2Tc9bu0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	good morning everyone i am back with a new guest and today we have dr chris kenobi he clinical associate professor at university of texas southwestern medical center and he actually is a doctor ophthalmology so he he welcome doc i able to make it thank you dr eric it thanks for the opportunity well you know the reason i bring you on is number one um i wanted you to speak at our upcoming summit for sure but your data is fascinating i uh you cover a point that um is just rarely talked about but it one of the most important things out there that i think people need to talk you know emphasize and understand and i know you and so i have a bunch of questions for you so i just want to dive right in uh you doctor of the eye so you you basically see things from a certain viewpoint and i want to know a little bit about how you got interested in the diet connection and how that related because you really talk about the vegetable oils and the impact of vegetable oils on the your eye but how did you stumble on this well uh yeah first first of all i definitely stumbled into it and uh to be honest with you and the audience is that i wouldn for my own suffering with arthritis that all started eric uh was i 16 years and just in a nutshell i kind of went partial paleo and in about 10 days my arthritis improved about 80 that was back in 2011. wow and eric it was so phenomenally uh life altering to me after all this suffering i had had and after seeing so many of my physician colleagues to try to help me and a dietary change which nobody had suggested made that kind of change for me it just it just uh instilled a desire in me to want to know more and then the more i started digging into this the more interested i became and and that just kind of ballooned and really i guess if you want the rest of the back story it that was 2011 and in 2013 i came across the research of weston a price and are your is your audience quite familiar with price them are um absolutely so yeah i think so okay so so just very briefly um weston price uh did phenomenal research in the 1930s where he evaluated people all over the world on five continents as they transitioned from native traditional diets over to westernized diets and westernized diets essentially contained refined white flours added sugars vegetable oils trans fats canned goods sweets confectionary in essence processed foods and price noted how those foods drove westernized disease that started with dental decay and then was followed by arthritis and cancers and all kinds of degenerative disease and so that was 2013 for me eric and later that year as i continued to study it just suddenly hit me in late 2013 that after i had understood that westernized processed foods are driving heart disease cancers strokes hypertension type 2 diabetes metabolic syndrome obesity autoimmune diseases when i understood all that finally it hit me and i thought could processed foods be driving age-related macular degeneration amd which is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss and blindness in people over the age of 65 worldwide and uh this is something that you know i had dealt with in the clinic for 24 years at that point and in any case so then i followed down that path and i continued and to investigate that while i was in practice for about the next year and a half and in early 2015 i felt i had enough evidence and i was convinced that i was on the right path although i couldn needed a ton of study and some more you know fundamental research and i left practice to pursue that so so a question about where did you personally have arthritis was it all over your body was it in your back where was it yeah so it when i was about 34 years old um it you know it started mostly in my knees and i had a lot of trouble with my knees in my mid to late 30s and then and then it i think next it kind of hit my elbows and then my shoulders and then my neck and then eventually my fingers my toes pretty soon i was riddled with arthritis and i was 50 years old at in 2011 and eric i was in severe pain and i i always been athletic and i got into where i just it was so hard for me to even just jog or warm up to lift weights uh it was just i just you know was on a disastrous path wow it sounds like we go ahead well i was given uh an immunosuppressant which i took for one day and the next day i heard about the paleo diet and started like i said kind of a makeshift paleo because i wasn very skeptical everything i arthritis was a you know a fail and those but that was all drugs wow like i said i dozen of my physician colleagues and um i don about my arthritis but nevertheless i mean none of them had ever said one thing about diet it was always a drug an injection steroids you know all that fascinating i think we have i think we have something in common because when i was 28 i had the ex similar thing i started noticing arthritis in my hands all down my back my spine i told my wife i yeah i and so i had it a little bit earlier than you but i know exactly what you going everywhere trying to help at that time i lived in san diego um and i actually stumbled uh price and pottinger had a whole center there and that to them as well which is interesting so i started turning things around but um getting back to the macula okay what is the macula of the eye so the macula is the central retina it accounts for about the central 10 degrees of vision and it is responsible for you being able to see somebody read words on a page to see a stop sign it vision and if that part of the retina degenerates then your vision will begin to decline and macular degeneration is probably for ophthalmologists today it probably uh second only to cataracts in terms of what uh ophthalmologists deal with at optometrists too in westernized countries and so yeah so this disease um it typically and then it can progress to a wet stage which can be severe and um let me just tell you that today this year they estimate that 196 million people are affected with macular degeneration in the world and of those by some estimates the world health organizations data would suggest that as of 2006 and that blindness the bilateral blindness probably around 3.15 million people in the world bilaterally blind meaning both eyes centrally blind they can their their their they can their grandchildren see to drive or read and if you think about that that is a staggering number of people it may be more than that so it could be approaching the population of the state of colorado where i live today in the world all blind you know from this disease and and you know when i first investigated this eric what i saw i had to go back and look at all the history and this i couldn research that had done this and what i found was that in a nutshell that between 1851 when mac when the when the retina was first visible uh because of the invention of the ophthalmoscope and then over the next 80 years up until about 1930 there was no more than about 50 cases of macular degeneration in all the world and ophthalmologists were using the ophthalmoscope and recording images and diagrams in the 1850s and so i go i go through that data but in a nutshell you know what i found was that this disease was extraordinarily rare and it changed as our diet changed and the the big picture here everybody uh if you don this is that we didn processed foods in the world with the exception of sugar up until 1866 approximately so we had very small quantities of sugar processed foods again being sugar refined flours vegetable oils and trans fats and in 18 right after the american civil war 1866 is when we first got vegetable oils we got refined white wheat flour in 1880 because of roller mill technology which is another refined nutrient deficient food and then in 1911 we got trans fats and if you put those four foods together that makes up processed food it things now uh big food manufacturers make 500 some thousand foods out of those today and those first of all are severely nutrient deficient and then they are toxic and here you is that almost all of these chronic diseases are driven by nutrient deficiency and toxicity and they all come from these foods the foods are nutrient deficient those four processed foods and then they have toxicity related primarily to vegetable oils trans fats and and probably the and the fructose component of sugar if the dose is right well you know you know i um if you take a look at each one of those individually i looked at the consumption i think before 1970 i just looked at 1970 to now and we have a trend going up with refined grains we have a trend in going up with sugar but what i didn stuff is that there is a massive spike i think it that really took off and you know we sugar well yeah we know that but there avoiding the vegetable fats and understanding what they can do not just to your eye but their whole body they can cause insulin resistance just like sugar um and i guess these that they is just completely and utterly um barbaric i mean it they there and they so when you look at when you look at the macula and you what and let become a problem would it and they notice like oh i and that could be other that could be maybe the eyeball maybe the lens is not correct or it could be the macula is the symptom of lack of eyesight very similar to all four of those causes or are they or is it a different thing where you the central part of your eye you can see because the macula handles so there little circle when you look or how would you differentiate macular versus just the shape of the eyeball is is not right as far as vision goes yeah good question so first of all you uh may not have any symptoms in the early stages of macular degeneration in fact you probably won anything and the the symptoms of any decrease in vision you would never be able to distinguish on your own from cataract or from refractive error you know being nearsighted or asymmetric or farsighted or whatever or maybe even glaucoma you to be able to distinguish anything yourself and you should never rely on your own perception of your vision you need to see an ophthalmologist or an optometrist to be evaluated and have you know have your retina evaluated everybody should start doing this in their 40s for sure and every you know two to three years i won people need to have their eyes examined eric in order to evaluate for that but the symptoms are similar oh they yeah you the the majority of people that in the early stages of macular degeneration they to have any clue at all that they have this disease and of course this would be the best time i mean of course you want to try to prevent all of these diseases and the best way to do that the only way to do that is through diet and um you know but but if you have it already the best thing to do is is you know see an ophthalmologist optometrist have a diagnosis and then you would make the same exact changes to your diet in order to prevent progression of the disease that you would in order to prevent it it you look at the macula and you diagnosing what is what uh extra blood vessels or is there you can you see like this destruction is there plaquing like what what causing this this what does this degeneration look like well uh you know the best thing would be to have a uh an image of that but you know because none of our audience is really going to hardly know what the retina looks like but you see these little you know whitish yellow dots called druzen and you see something called pigmentary disturbance which is is something that is affecting the retinal pigment epithelium beneath the you know beneath the retina proper and those that that and if it progresses eric which about 15 10 to 15 percent of the people that have dry macular degeneration will progress into the wet stage and this is a stage where the vessels can grow up underneath the retina leak fluid and bleed and that that is devastating to the vision and um and the calc can be treated but i don that at all but yeah i was just kind of curious about the effects of um like this vegetable oils is it as an oxidative inflammatory free radical thing that creating that damage or is it similar to diabetes where you creating um destruction of the blood vessels to the eye through the retina itself i don but it just i viewpoint yeah you know um i eric i almost have to uh giggle when people ask me you know during the like a podcast or whatever you know what is the what is the tell me what the um the cause of this is at the molecular level or tell me what is the mechanism right you know i was thinking the other day i should say okay let me summarize 32 500 scientific papers that have been published on this in the last four decades because that about what there is i mean there you know of evidence here to try to you know put into a nutshell but let me just say that here here big picture is is that vegetable oils are they have four main problems and this is going to apply to macular degeneration heart disease atherosclerosis stroke type 2 diabetes metabolic syndrome obesity alzheimer autoimmune okay these the main things is that vegetable oils are going to are first going to be nutrient deficient because they don any vitamins a d and k2 none in any oil even the really good oils like a good coconut oil no none of those vitamins right yeah they risk for nutrient deficiencies and vitamins a d and k 2 create an amazing synchrony and synergy that drives health and so this is what you know weston price began to show us back in the 1930s i mean did an incredible job with this all right so that don replace the healthy animal fats lard butter beef tallow you know eggs organ meat fish eggs all these kinds of things that are that are rich in these fat soluble vitamins a d and k two we used to plant those with vegetable oils now you deficient that problem number two you down a pro oxidative pathway and eric i cannot tell you how important i have i so much i years that tells me this is the most important thing of all on a mechanistic uh level is the pro-oxidative effect okay so so that drives oxidation i can come back and review that in some detail third pro-inflammatory so the the omega-6 seed oils are pro-inflammatory gonna lead you down an inflammatory path and then finally they toxic loosely what i mean is is they are poisonous and they because the seed oils can they contain and or in our own bodies will produce uh toxic aldehydes for one thing but these toxic aldehydic end products which are things like 4-hydroxynonenol which is 4h and e malone dialdehyde or mda 9 and 13 hoed which is hydroxy octadeca dianoic acid carboxyethylpyrol and acrylene these are just five but there aldehydes that are connected with all of these diseases so collectively those things right there are cytotoxic meaning directly toxic to cells genotoxic you know toxic to the genes mutagenic carcinogenic atherogenic atherosclerosis inducing thrombogenic clot inducing and obesogenic and on top of all that you know we have if you look at the whole picture you know the seed oils are driving you know if you look at this big picture one of the first things they do is they drive they they damage the mitochondria and the first thing that happens at the mitochondrial level is you become insulin resistant at the cellular level and this is where i resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction and the mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell for those who don of our energy is produced and seed oils severely damage the mitochondria through these oxidative effects and you begin to lose energy and the cell begins to become dysfunctional and or dies and now what what i understand and what you know people understand is that that work on this all the time is that mitochondrial dysfunction is a part of all of these chronic diseases it you know heart disease congestive heart failure atherosclerosis cancers macular degeneration type 2 diabetes metabolic syndrome if i didn say it yet obesity all these disorders are connected through mitochondrial dysfunction why would they all have this and the reason i stress and where does oxidative stress come come from primarily seed oils now what about someone sitting back watching this and says well i don corn oil i don don they don insidious this problem is i mean it i don i i think i read on your website there is uh an average person consumes seven what 700 calories of this stuff per day in their diet without even knowing it is is that am i exaggerating or no no that it was 80 grams a day uh of the average person in 2010 and that can go back and get give you the big picture but in 2010 the average american was consuming 80 grams of vegetable oil a day well you know oils fats are nine calories of grams that calories and that is 32.5 of u.s consumption literally a third of our diet is coming out of factories i mean ivor cummins calls these factory fats and kate shanahan who studied studied this for 25 years you know she says nature doesn bad fats factories do and i think that powerful message because these oils they you know they heated they alkalinized bleached and deodorized all chemically and heated about four or five times and by the time they hit this bottle and you looking kind of slightly yellow uh um oil it looks great but that is a that because it contains all these toxic aldehydes and when you consume it it will accumulate in your body but if i go back here eric so if so i i did this analysis this this will be coming out in our next published paper i bunch of other ophthalmologists and vision scientists but but i did an analysis to look at what our omega-6 linoleic acid that the main fatty acid in seed oils what our consumption of that fatty acid would have been in 1865 before the world had any of these vegetable oils and it was 2.2 grams so so we got seed oils by 1866 well by 1909 we were already at 4.84 grams by 1999 we were at 18 grams a day and by 2008 we are at 29 grams a day okay now let me give you the percentages so in 1865 before the world had any vegetable oils um our in the us for example that 2.2 grams of omega-6 linoleic acid that is about one percent of our caloric consumption by 1909 we percent of caloric consumption by 1999 we um sorry here i could try to remember the numbers um ah i went blank it there we go i have there seven percent of caloric consumption and by 2008 11.8 percent just rounded off 12 of caloric consumption okay now like a spike yeah so people will say well we need you know little like out there you need omega-6 and omega-3 and you do they linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid which is the comparable omega-3 but guess how much you need 0.5 percent of your diet needs to be omega-6 linoleic acid point five percent that one percent yeah and and so in other words so we went from um you know what right well let me just put it to in 2008 we are consuming 24 fold more omega-6 linoleic acid than what we actually need to be consuming you know i just if you look at all these you know native traditional populations which i and i keto summit i but i all of them their omegas okay none of them have any vegetable oils because if you have vegetable oils you food diet you but all these native traditional populations who don sugars white flowers seed oils or trans fats all of their own the highest omega 6 like i have found is still under 2 percent the the the uh the messiah of kenya and tanzania they consume 66 animal fat which is 33 to 45 saturated fat but they i mean with all that fat 66 of their diet being animal fat their omega-6 was still 1.7 well the omega-6 in you know westernized diets all around the world today is around 8 to 12 or higher and what the whole world is getting overweight obese and sick sicker than dogs and it you know i i i was thinking that the problem is far worse in developed nations but guess what the the world health organization shows us that developing nations 69 of the deaths in developing nations in recent years are from chronic disease these same things heart disease cancers strokes hypertension type 2 diabetes you know all that and guess what so so let me give you one more statistic between 1963 and 2003 in developed nations vegetable oils doubled on average uh kaiser did this work um so 40-year period they doubled in developed nations but in developing nations vegetable oils tripled in that same period of time in that 40-year period and in developing nations their sugar consumption is really low i mean it organization says don than 10 percent of your calories as sugar i think that but get you know what they were in developing nations during that period 19 from well from 1964 to 1994 i believe it was their consumption of sugar in developing nations on average was around 6 to seven percent sugar they probably it driving i mean why are all those people in developing nations why are they all getting these diseases at as much or higher rate than we are right because of vegetable oils vegetable oils have gone everywhere that you know every just like western price showed in the 30s if you could find if you could get to a place by roads you know by a port or roads processed foods were there you know the big food manufacturers were selling their food and there a few isolated places in the world where people aren what is the um i know if it or whatever but aren consume more vegetable oils than saturated fats that right i don can tell you this um the so you know sally fallon from the western area price foundation calls the these organizations the diet dictocrats and and she harvard school of public health and i not you know this is not about harvard it school of public health and then the nutrition department of tufts university also in boston the nutrition department of mayo clinic the american heart association and there they vegetable oils are healthy omega-6 is healthy and so people are so confused because i mean if harvard tells you it are you to believe right and um but you know you this is why this is one of the reasons i think people like you and me and you know chris masterjohn and chris cresser and joe mercola you know get into this is because you know most of us from our own suffering and you start going i gotta figure this out because i can tell me what why do they tell us this eric there only one reason they tell us vegetable oils are healthy one reason as far as i know and it because vegetable oils make your cholesterol go down so if you believe that cholesterol is the problem in heart disease you might buy this argument and that is such a massive fallacy as you know that it not about cholesterol it uh you know it about oxidized ldl when we talk about and all that where does oxidized ldl come from it comes from the exact same thing vegetable oils and sugar possible you know to a lesser degree but vegetable oils are driving oxidized ldl and oxidized ldl drives atherosclerosis drives coronary heart disease and you know ivor cummins has showed us that you know i mean he attention to the fact these studies have shown for example that um the greater your oxidized ldl the greater your heart disease on a coronary artery calcium scan which is the gold standard for evaluating heart disease i mean i nice i had mine it was zero two probably would have been a lot higher before and i know you the summit but um these vegetables also have a half-life of i think one to two years and they make up your cell membranes they go into the body and they um if your body oils it it different level probably stiffening of the arteries who knows what else i mean it if you eat you eat sugar today if i eat a cup of sugar today i can either store it as glycogen in my liver and muscles or i if there if there calories i mostly into monounsaturated and saturated fat right that but if you consume polyunsaturated fats your body these omega-6 oils we talking about and omega-3 too your body was not it was designed to get these in really tiny quantities because we weren designed to ever have vegetable oils in our diets and so your body stores these omega-6 and omega-3s preferentially and it doesn oxidize them for fuel i mean that doesn talk about that but anyway so yes you store them and they get stored in your fat and they get stored in your cellular membranes and they get stored in your mitochondrial membranes where they create all this havoc and the thing is is they store at approximately your as an approximate level whatever you in your diet your adipose tissue will be approximately twice as high in this omega-6 so if you consume one percent of your diet as omega-6 you four percent i said roughly okay you know with your in in your omega-6 in your fat but if you consume 10 or 12 percent of your diet as omega-6 you will be at about 20 some percent in your fat so stefan gnay showed this data just brilliant stuff in 19 he looked at 37 studies that looked at the linoleic acid in our body fat in americans body fat just americans 37 studies and collated all this data graphed it so 1959 the average linoleic acid omega-6 in americans fat was uh 9.1 9.1 now remember obesity in 1960 was 13 percent in the u.s 2008 um linoleic acid in americans fat averaged 21 and a half percent what was obesity in 2008 i think it was around 32 something like that and um all of these diseases have tracked accordingly so so this is what we see is the more of these you consume the more they stored in your fat and they stay there okay oh and back to your your question how long are they in your fat well this is the really bad news this is where you have to pay for your nutritional sins and i hate this but the the half-life shown in studies and there multiple studies that have looked at this but the half-life of these omega-6 fats in your fat is 600 to 680 days you might as well round it off to around two uh two years now the you know the in pharmacology what we learn is it takes about five half-lives to get rid of a substance like a drug from your body now nobody knows if that acid but as a rough estimate then that means that it few years maybe up to even eight or ten years once you get all these out of your diet you get your omega-6 really low to get your omega-6 in your fat down down to really low level like it should be but you know what in three days of go of getting vegetable oils out of your diet your inflammation markers will go down your pro-oxidative status will go down your toxicity from the aldehydes will go down guess what you uh you i believe of heart attack and stroke in three days wow you know this uh if if you wondering what oils we talking about soy corn canola cotton seed probably some other ones as well like um safflower sunflower maybe even peanut oil i don peanut oil yes all of those yeah so i it soybean corn canola cottonseed rapeseed grape seed sunflower safflower and rice bran those are the biggies there and but those are the big ones so you know if you just want to stick get we got to get the big picture right first and that get those out of your diet yeah start reading labels too that mayonnaise you can a salad dressing without it i mean it difficult so it you know even a salad this is where you know sally fallon says where it salad dressing because they with these vegetable oils and you probably you and your audience probably both know this eric but you can states 79 of it is adulterated with these vegetable oils and why is that it olive oil and we can talk about olive oil uh i not the biggest fan partly for this reason but there it so greatly that you you know 80 essentially of the olive oils in the us you can adulterated with all these cheap just you know horrible oils and why is that because it profitable olive oil good extra virgin olive oil that prepared and maintained and all that is expensive the seed oils are dirt cheap um in 2000 uh as recently as 2014 one on the world one kilogram of the vegetable of these vegetable oils on average was one u.s dollar oh well come on 80 grams a day of that you know in the american diet works out to be about 8 cents i think it is and as low as for soybean oil as low as 5.6 cents so in other words so here you can take let a big food manufacturer you can take you know 5.6 cents or 8 cents worth of of these oils you can take two cents worth of refined wheat flour and two cents worth of sugar and you can make pop-tarts and sell them for four dollars and so most of the money goes into the marketing not into the product right the box and so so and and so getting back to your you know question and statement about these are in all the foods well guess what everything you almost all the processed foods you look out you know they these four things you know i mean you just put them together just look at every label and you find out most of them are going to be made from refined flours sugars and seed oils it wouldn and be really careful about olive oil i wouldn most of it that oil can be okay i don little bit skeptical quite frankly about the the polyunsaturated left fat in even in olive oil for most americans who are already have a lot of omega-6 in their own fat it too high i would get it out i i just cook everything in butter we just stick with uh pasture-raised butter um to cook everything in i just don oils quite frankly i don them for the most part i think coconut oil is probably the safest one on the market um even coconut oil doesn d and k2 not like you know like butter wood i mean butter a good pasture-raised butter is going to give you all of those yeah exactly so this brings me to my i to withhold myself because um we talk about a lot of this at the summit but there gosh there answer you just ask two last questions okay when you um consume mineral oil for example i know for a fact that pulls out of your liver and your body um a lot of fat soluble vitamins because it you i know when you when someone exposes itself to mineral oil they end up with a deficiency of vitamin a vitamin d etc so my thought was when you mentioned refined oils just like refined sugar they you not just the vitamins but the fat soluble vitamins so i probably why because there they vitamins in there and they to suck out some of the which is in your liver i would imagine that i what mineral oil is i have to people take it as a laxative yeah but what from i mean does it come from different sources or what is it coming from eric i think honestly i think it it might be some type of petroleum product i i exact ingredients but it refined empty oil that people use as a laxative and i actually don but i okay i guess i and this is what you know every once in a while somebody throws a question at me i just go like a guy asked me about emu oil the other day and i don principles there that i could get to but i mineral oil i just don know what its source is or what it uh yeah and so okay um so i don answer for that at all totally fine if i don answer i i people every day um about about this and i don who i learn it from i trying to learn like like you and everybody else right me too uh and then the other question is uh side question um so you have all these people that have fatty livers and there a few of them i mean if you have a gut you have a fatty liver and they they have insulin resistance they doing sugar and um what happens is that um the vegetable oils really can disrupt the production of bile in your liver and the release of bile i know that even when i was in practice for 29 years you the the damage that these vegetable oils do to your bile ducts in the liver as far as they become bile deficient they can release and a lot of that bile starts backing up into the liver and it starts to create fibrosis and scar tissue so there not just gall stones but just the congested colostasis where you have this uh this stagnant bile that but what interesting the treatment for that um is bile salts and what about that is that there seems to be a really interesting connection between taking that improving eye vision there taking bio salts that i reason i an ophthalmologist i don you looked at that connection but i noticed when i used to put my patients on bile salts they would their vision would just really improve greatly and either the mechanism it triggers the vitamin a receptor in the eye because i know it might help you drain all the liver so you can start to have the liver function again but there between the vision and your liver in biles i don had experience with that i just wanted to bring it up as a side note yeah no you well first of all uh here again you taken me completely off guard and i much about uh the liver disease uh i do know i mean with regard to bile and bile function and how bile salts my my first reaction is is that if we vegetable oils are reducing our ability to first of all absorb vitamin a and they vitamin a deficient but they absorption and i the bile salts then are improving vitamin a uh absorption perhaps and uh well i guessing here eric no that sounds screw it you know with the with what i do know i may be off base here and i don may be uh i may be off base here but um but you know some of my recent work you know what i for example with the eye and this applies to the whole body the world is vitamin a deficient but it rampant if not more so than vit i think it rampant than vitamin d deficiency and probably everybody who realizes that vitamin d deficiency is extraordinary in this world today and both deficiencies are connected with almost any chronic disease you can name there are inverse relationships between vitamin d and vitamin a uh and virtually every chronic disease there is in other words as the chronic disease prevalence goes up the vitamin vitamin a and vitamin d deficient or levels go down in other words more vitamin deficiency more disease and and then you know k2 comes in in there as well but k2 is even much harder to as far as i know to measure and analyze um but but you know vitamin d is easy to measure and um you know supposedly treat that and that think okay but anyway i this this could go back to it goes back to vitamin a uh absorption perhaps yeah that makes that makes sense well anyway i just really appreciate your attention your time to do this and uh um for everyone that is on um we summit at the end of august so i hope you guys um can show up because it presentation and you deliver the full rundown on what you been studying i see that as well so thank you and we august at the end of august and i link down below for more information as well as your website and your information you have a foundation as well as a lot of great data on macular uh degeneration and i down below as well awesome right yeah just so if i could say the it foundation it we are a 501c3 nonprofit and uh so nobody

Stomach Growling is a Symptom of...	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69D-bjsjUBo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so someone had a question about what is that growling sound in my stomach is that just hunger pains what actually is it you may have these sounds when you but the hunger is not the thing that causing it okay the thing that something called migrating motor complex now what the heck is that that is a certain housekeeping condition in your body where it cleaning out the debris the extra food particles and there certain waves of peristalsis or a pumping action of debris going through the small intestine and into the large colon why is that so important because one really important function of this is to prevent sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth a lot of people by the way have this condition they don it and that condition is when you have too much bacteria in your small intestine the majority should be in the large intestine when the bacteria gets into the small intestine it starts robbing you of nutrients fat soluble vitamins but like vitamin a vitamin d potassium vitamin c zinc and it leaves you deficient not only that you start getting fermenting of vegetables and other fibers that get in here and you start experiencing a lot of bloating so if you consume like vegetables or fiber or even probiotics and you feel worse you could have sibo going on right here because this mechanism is not working it through and when you have sibo you have a lot of growling going on a lot of sounds going on there because your body is trying to clean it out but it can what would you do to stop the growling well it but of course if you have sibo you know if you eat it feel more bloating bile salts are antibacterial they kill bacteria and usually people that have sibo are very deficient in bile i mean think about it right the gallbladder is releasing bile into the small intestine and the bile goes through the small intestine and very little of it ends up in the large intestine most of it gets absorbed in the small intestine and gets recycled and if you have sibo you produce less bile to then kill off the microbes by taking purified bile salts it greatly help get rid of sibo also it growling sounds and by getting rid of sibo your body will make more bile lowering stress will help diminish the growling sounds fixing the sibo by taking bile as well as betaine hydrochloride fixing the stomach acid as well that will help both of those last thing and this is very important is to start doing intermittent fasting and give it some time to work because this mechanism right here kicks in between 90 minutes and three hours so if you never give this system a chance to kick in and do its work so the more you do intermittent fasting the more you out and the less growling you to have because you more bile to actually make sure that this bacteria doesn stay in there and the fact that eating stops this process so you want to go for a good amount of time without eating to allow your body to clean out the debris by going 16 17 18 hours of fasting so it can do its house cleaning if you want some more information about bile salts i put a video right here check it out	Success
Glucagon Triggers Ketosis, Insulin Blocks It	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4fR2U4g0u0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so i insulin and blood sugars and diabetes but there that works with insulin that i haven talked about very often so i wanted to cover it and make it really simple it it sounds like glucose but it glucose it that opposes insulin so it kind of works in opposite to insulin so let what glucagon does in relationship to ketosis ketosis is a state of fat burning glucagon turns the switch on for ketosis insulin turns it off so insulin blocks ketosis glucagon releases stored sugar stored sugar is called glycogen okay and your liver in your muscles so glucagon will release this into glucose as fuel insulin will store glucose as glycogen and as fat whereas glucagon will release the stored sugar glycogen into glucose and it okay so it so insulin lowers the sugar in the blood glucagon will raise it where does it get the sugar from right here the stored sugar and the fat so it counter hormone to insulin so let for example you have too much insulin and it shoves your blood sugar way down and you get hypoglycemia okay you get the shakes and you craving everything well normally glucagon is supposed to kick in there and counter that it counter regulating hormone that keeps the blood sugars where it needs to be realize that glucagon is one of the fat burning hormones as well now if we take a look at insulin insulin is the dominating hormone in other words in the presence of insulin glucagon will be lowered insulin knocks you out of ketosis glucagon puts you into ketosis insulin is triggered by carbohydrates protein okay and eating right here protein now you thinking wow protein out of ketosis well look at over here glucagon also is triggered by protein so protein will trigger both hormones so that will counter the negative effect of insulin fyi so you don about protein knocking a lot of ketosis unless you consume a lot of it vigorous exercise will trigger glucagon adrenaline will trigger glucagon what triggers adrenaline vigorous exercise stress will do it too this is one of the reasons why people will lose weight during stress but chronic stress they gain weight because the cortisol when you experience stress acute stress you have more adrenaline chronic stress you cortisol issues now there hormone that eating so look over here every time you eat insulin is triggered every time you eat glucogon is triggered as well again we have a situation where eating will trigger insulin but also glucagon when eating protein you hormones now when you you will trigger glucagon and when you insulin what will inhibit glucagon high sugar in the diet and insulin i hope you got that but that glucagon is hey we recipe no brains no sugar totally keto there suffering in keto absolutely not karen and it system builder absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it but is it simple it hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating it	Success

The Best Remedy for Cardiac Arrhythmias	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcrQFs4wVOo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so let remedies for cardiac arrhythmias now whether we palpitations or atrial fibrillation one of the big problems with a severe arrhythmia issue is that the blood can pool in different parts of the heart and create clotting and then that can actually turn into a stroke when you go to the doctor they blocker a calcium channel blocker or digitalis what i want to do in this video is give you an alternative but of course check with your doctor before discontinuing any of this medication that being said the unifying theory or agreement that most of the medical professionals have about an arrhythmia is that there with calcium calcium is leaking from the cardiac cells calcium is very very necessary in the body but if there cells that can be very toxic and if there the cell that can be very toxic as well now there purposes of calcium in the body but one huge function of calcium is it molecule or a messenger type molecule that causes certain functions to occur in certain pathways calcium also affects another signaling molecule which is right here i don into the details camp the only thing i want you to know about this right now is it works with calcium when you have arrhythmias there and a problem with this thus the medication a calcium channel blocker and another medication used for arrhythmias called digitalis which affects the sodium calcium relationship in past videos i talked about potassium deficiencies and magnesium deficiencies causing arrhythmias and the reason why these two would work is because both of these minerals help balance calcium and keep calcium from becoming too toxic inside the cell and if you have an advanced arrhythmia you could be pretty deficient in magnesium and potassium and that could take some time to fortify your body it could take actually even months but in the meantime there good remedy that i d-ribose and d is actually the natural form of ribose and ribose is a signaling molecule for this other signaling molecule okay it of like a precursor or a building block for this right here because it improves cardiac muscle physiology it recommended when you have cramps or soreness in the muscle after you exercise so it tends to bypass the damaged pathways in the heart and it gets the myocardial cells the heart muscles to work better it also can reduce angina it chronic fatigue syndrome and the dosage i would be five grams two to three times a day you don go over five grams because sometimes it can actually give you a little digestive problem maybe it so stick with five grams two to three times a day and you notice that this will give you a lot of relief some people mix this with their coffee because caffeine aggravates arrhythmias but adding this to it will tend to rid the jittery feelings or the abnormal extra palpitations you may get when you consume caffeine and i also want to add this you probably already know this but drinking alcohol causes arrhythmias chronic stress can cause arrhythmias of course eating food that depletes your potassium magnesium will cause arrhythmias a lot of refined carbs and sugars and refined grains and also a diet low in potassium magnesium and that would be a diet that in vegetables an average american consumes only 1.5 cups of vegetables so i don minerals from but over time that can lead to problems with the heart also exposure to emf i and this is a big problem especially if you all day long what the electromagnetic fields from those electrical devices can interfere with your own electrical fields and create arrhythmias just right here so you may want to get that checked definitely work on these things okay to actually get to the bottom of the arrhythmias and you may want to start taking this remedy to give you some relief in the meantime i personally don i don to have to do your research on on that part thanks for watching and i will see you in the next video hey we recipe no brains no sugar totally keto there suffering in keto absolutely not karen and it absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it to be keto but is it simple it hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating it	Success

Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSHmvOL3U44	Dr. Eric Berg DC	all right so you get really full fast but two hours later you are starving why is that well you have instant resistance okay and that insulin can thereby you can allow the nutrients and the fuel to go into the cell so this is a problem it resistive because insulin is supposed to allow nutrition and fuel to go into the cell so that system was so dependent on food for its blood sugars okay and frequent eating that it fat reserve yet so your digestive system is filled with food but it matter of time before that goes away where you back in because it if you reserves so what do you do do you keep eating more fat to make yourself bloated no you have to make sure that you consume the nutrients specifically vegetables in large quantities the leafy greens are going to be very essential to starting to fix this problem right here because you need more potassium you need more magnesium you also need more vitamin b1 to help heal this so number one make sure that you correct with the moderate protein large vegetables apple cider vinegar which is going to be very very important to speed things up and just make sure that you doing it very gradual so you don to go too long and suffer too long because you then just give it a little more time and your body will adapt so I want to know what you in as far as a video click the link down below and share some ideas I want to hear	Success
What Are The Main Causes of Vitamin B1 Deficiency (Thiamine)? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE_pToQoXx8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys someone had a question how do you actually become deficient in vitamin b1 because uh and these other videos I was talking about the importance of b1 when you fascinating to also protect you against the damage of high levels of insulin and high sugar okay this is how you become deficient number one you consume refined grains in the form of breads pasta cereal crackers this gets white rice things like that alcohol will do it liver damage as in a fatty liver or cirrhosis of the liver which a lot of people have and they don cortisol from medications that you taking prednisone anti-inflammatories that type of thing metformin which is the main medication for type 2 diabetes creates a b1 deficiency which then can set the person up for experiencing complications of diabetes so if anyone they better be taking b1 at the same time to counter the side effects there were six sugar any of the sugars will deplete b1 unless you actual sugar cane by itself because that course no one does that and I don recommend it because it high in sugar but it will not deplete you of b1 because naturally sugar cane has b1 in it but the refined version does not okay number seven tea there certain acid called tannic acid which blocks b1 so if you of tea you certain raw fish will deplete b1 number nine sulfites okay I have a video on that I put a link down below sulfites they that has an anti b1 effect okay number ten insulin resistance okay and also that includes being a diabetic because when your insulin resistant you can the b1 and this is like probably 60% of the population right here number 11 coffee will deplete b1 three ways from the tannic acid from the calf and from another chemical called Oh dye phenols okay so if you coffee you just make sure you nutritional yeast and try to keep it at one small cup per day 12 medications annotate acids antibiotics diuretics tamoxifen which is a medication that blocks estrogen in the body and there a lot of other medications as well 13 GI problems let gastrointestinal problems low stomach acid will block your absorption of b1 there you have it these are the reasons why you would become deficient thanks for watching if you information and getting something out of it please give me an unbiased Google review I put a link down below thanks	Success
Menstrual Cycle Cravings and Nutrient Deficiencies Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6bkXRXE0PQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys in this video we talk about your menstrual cycle and cravings now the minister cycle is very complex so I complexities we about generally what certain parts of the cycle and if you crave at certain points what you would need okay so here ovulating okay day 28 and then you going to right before your actual menstruation where you period right here okay so now if you are craving during ovulation that means there with estrogen so you would need to consume more cruciferous vegetables and/or seek help because iodine and cruciferous vegetables really help to balance estrogen all right so that what you do during this phase right here but most women crave right before they men straight okay so this is the kind of phase with that when they have PMS so they may have a lot of mood issues irritability depression so you have a lot going on not to mention cravings for all sorts of things chocolate you know whatever so what you want to do if you have a problem at this point is you need a lot more B vitamins okay I recommend you trishal yeast and whatever it says to take on the bottle if you tablets double the dosage okay especially vitamin b1 that really help this phase right here if you can get some Sun to get vitamin D that would be also good but mainly it vitamin deficiency in vitamin C deficiency vitamin C is really important in this phase as well and you can diminish the symptoms so you can get vitamin C from sauerkraut or you can get it from the store but make sure it food based vitamin C don synthetic vitamin C like ascorbic acid a food base but sauerkraut is actually really good because that will also help your digestion as well now what about during the cycle itself you could have cravings you can have cramps I so you have a whole series of things that happen excessive bleeding so at this point the the best remedy would be a calcium magnesium in the form of an orotate it orotate sometimes you can get it combined but I like the word tape because it penetrates the cell a lot deeper but calcium magnesium will dramatically and improve your cramping and cravings if you have them right during your period okay now post menstruation right here you probably lost some blood and you in iron maybe a little anemic and you might crave things as well especially if you ice that recommend red meats is make sure it grass-fed but that the iron back in pretty fast also you can get different forms of iron in the green green leafy vegetables and definitely kale like a kale shake red meat that would be really good post your cycle especially if you crave certain things now if you through menopause it different situation because you longer having your cycle but maybe you just crave in general or maybe you have like a hint of a cycle coming on but it doesn one deficiency that shows up in menopause is a vitamin E deficiency and a lot of vitamin E is stored in the pituitary gland to actually as a precursor to make sex hormones like estrogen and testosterone and things like that so because you your cycle you hormones the vitamin E really drops dramatically in the body so if you were to increase vitamin E you would see some great improvements raw sunflower seeds probably your best bet some of the other seeds would be good too but it can roasted it has to be raw almonds really important and leafy greens like even snap peas or green beans are really good anything green is going to give you good amounts of vitamin E now if you in estrogen and you say hot flashes boron is really really good as well that mineral that can elevate estrogen it not going to bring it out of the range but it level okay so there you have it that little summary of what you would do for various cravings at certain points of your menstrual cycle thanks for watching so if you don want to check it out it not lose weight to get healthy it healthy to lose the weight healthy ketosis and in a minute fasting check it out I put a link down below	Success
Benefits of Vitamin B1 Â Numbness & Tingling In Hands & Feet Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d41ttKFOuKo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys had another question that someone want to know the difference between having numbness in your hands or feet versus tingling or pins and needle type sensation okay what difference here happening when you have low bottom b1 in the presence of high blood sugar and/or high insulin you circulation the blood flow to the nerves okay and then that leads to something called peripheral neuropathy it happens in the feet happens in the hands and it starts out as a little tingling then pain it can be burning and then pins and needles and then the last stage is numbness okay as that nerve is dying a simple solution would be to go to the health of store or go online and search out a product called benfotiamine this is a type of B vitamin that is made into a fat soluble form because normally b1 is water-soluble but they make it into a fat soluble so it can innervate the fat that surrounds the nerves a lot better it it have any side effects but it remedy for neurological damage it good for the damage to your retina when you have diabetes or even as a pre-diabetic so this is important this is why I always recommend also taking a nutritional yeast because it has the natural be bad omens in there because this is just one of the beads you want to take all of the B but sometimes you can actually fix it with nutritional yeast but sometimes it a little bit stronger okay so benfotiamine is what you need it could be another condition where the space inside the spinal column is getting smaller and smaller and that called spinal stenosis okay that another condition it could be something called thoracic outlet syndrome withers in the neck you have an obstruction whether it or some type of problem where it obstructing not just the nerves but the blood vessels as well and it could also be that you have poor circulation where there causing it but more than likely it going to be neurological so as you change your diet in Duke in fasting and if that still doesn clear it up go get check for a pinched nerve or poor circulation thanks for watching so if you and spread the word	Success
Zinc Deficiency and Your Liver Problems Â Symptoms of Zinc Deficiency Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo7IP3WpX6w	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so in this video i want to talk about the relationship between zinc in your liver zinc is probably one of the most important minerals for the liver and here when you look at the symptoms from a zinc deficiency they of a liver problem and i a liver that it or there when people have a liver problem they usually get loss of appetite the loss of body hair altered taste and smell now it could be because you atrophy your immune system is impaired you have decreased ability to detoxify drugs from your body you can get ascites you have this protruded stomach because the liver is leaking fluid into a sac around the stomach a deficiency of zinc can increase your risk for liver cancer inflammation in the liver and a lot of skin problems the question is is it the chicken of the egg does a zinc deficiency cause the liver to create these symptoms or is it the liver damage that symptoms as well as creating a zinc deficiency well that we do know in an isolated situation the zinc deficiency for example will create low testosterone and testicular atrophy but if the liver is damaged you going to be able to get rid of estrogen and you estrogen which is indirectly going to cause a low testosterone situation what we do know is all these symptoms right here could be a zinc deficiency or it could be a problem with your liver and by getting more zinc in your diet or taking it in the supplement form you can reduce these symptoms right here and even sometimes prevent them as well as protect the liver if you are high in zinc shellfish is at the top of the list beef liver beef in general lamb other meats seeds nuts dairy products eggs there is zinc in whole wheat but the problem is the bran in wheat products prevents the absorption of zinc because it has something called phytates so of course to get the zinc you want to avoid all grains as well as sugar because when you consume sugar you deplete zinc unfortunately a lot of people have a zinc deficiency and they don we don if you diet chances are you somewhat deficient and it and you may not even notice a full-blown deficiency until later because some of the subclinical or subtle signs of a zinc deficiency could be like fatigue and weakness and lethargy that you may associate with something else if you have any liver problem or any attention that you potentially could have a liver problem make sure you have enough zinc in your diet because that if not the most important mineral to support a healthy liver hey we recipe no brains no sugar totally keto there suffering in keto absolutely not karen and it absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it simple it we hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating it you	Success
Cavities: The 2nd Most Common Disease Worldwide...but Why?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9Bz_TBvd9A	Dr. Eric Berg DC	did you realize that cavities are the second most common disease worldwide the number one disease is the common cold but cavities come in number two what is a cavity well the root word for cavity means whole there you dental decay in other words the bone is dissolving and it to the point where there now what the teeth is that they indestructible and you don constantly being replaced on this enamel this outside of this tooth right here they know this from looking at fossils certain skulls the teeth are usually still there and they there that will destroy them and that is a certain type of bacteria they mutants as being the main bacteria that apparently is causing these little holes and you have a lot of friendly bacteria that are living in your mouth as you consume sugar and other carbohydrates that can ferment what happens is the population of this bacteria starts going higher and higher and higher until it hits a certain tipping point where it and when it ferments this sugar it creates an acid which dissolves or demineralizes your bone creating a hole when you consume certain refined carbohydrates and sugar you feeding this microbe and you plaque forming bacteria which is then causing decay because it creating an acid of course the solution to this is just to brush your teeth right and make sure that your toothpaste has fluoride and you drink water with fluoride and you good to go right well here problem with cavities in fact 90 of the population has cavities why well when you look this up they really emphasizing this bacteria and that you have to scrub and keep your teeth clean and and make sure you kill these microbes but what about the food what about the the fuel that they live on to create this whole thing they this is omitted information okay the question is why is this information omitted recently there was some new information that gave some light on this topic and there are certain documents found now don it was in the basement of harvard university could have been in some other basement but they found this interesting document it was actually by the sugar trade organization that was funded by the sugar industry and this is what the document revealed that the sugar industry paid off a key researcher from harvard university 50 years ago to downplay the relationship between dietary sugar and heart disease and dietary sugar and cavities and put the blame on dietary fat in fact this study back then did not reveal the source of the funding now we this idea that we just need to keep brushing and taking her fluoride to prevent the cavities when it working in fact there fluorosis okay in fact if you look this up it say it tooth okay part of the tooth uh turns like excessive white it bleaching effect the truth is that when you expose a young child to too much fluoride it can weaken the teeth it can affect calcium metabolism in your body and give this appearance right here but what becoming weak itself and apparently it where there children actually have that condition and it actually quite interesting to me of how much corruption that with so-called science of course you know science is a sacred cow it but what about the massive corruption that there are so many scientific concepts that end up being false 30 to 40 to 50 to 60 years later unfortunately so if you have kids or your kid watching this just cut out the sugar okay and you cut out the cavities very very simple thanks for watching hey we recipe no brains no sugar totally keto there suffering in keto absolutely not karen and it absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it to be keto but is it simple it hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating it you	Success
7 Early Signs of Kidney Disease	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xU_NUu3ey4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we seven early signs of kidney disease there that the kidney could potentially go through very mild to very severe when you start to reach the level of four or five you have to avoid certain things in your diet big time like you have to avoid potassium phosphorous and there other ones but what that potassium has a protective effect on the kidney but when there certain point where it the body can avoid potassium all right let early signs of kidney disease the first one would be a metallic taste in your mouth or you your breath smells like ammonia and because the kidney is a filter it like an oil filter things are backing up and it out of the breath it mouth you you shouldn number two you have protein aversion you have a great dislike of protein especially meat number three you you with concentration and number five you have itchiness number six a loss of appetite number seven your face is swollen your feet are swollen and even your hands have edema and their swelling because the kidney has millions of tiny little filters okay the blood goes through and then it actually recycles a lot of things and it gets rid of the waste one of the best indicators of kidney dysfunction whether it would be to check the gfr it stands for glomerular filtration rate this is a measurement of how well the kidney is acting as a filter and one of the ways they look at this value is they look at the creatine of the blood and creatine is a type of protein also if you have protein in the urine or you have high bun blood urea nitrogen and this is a in a blood test and one of the biggest causes of kidney damage is being a diabetic or pre-diabetic because the years of chronic consumption of refined carbohydrates junk foods can all cause kidney destruction if your glucose is on the high end that what happens is that that starts damaging the tiny filtration units in the kidney the blood vessels of the retina of the eye destruction of the internal layer of the coronary artery on the heart as well as the distal nerves which is the nerves at the very end of the toes of the bottom of the feet or the hands so you capillaries which is starving off nutrients to the nerves but the kidney is definitely one area that this high level of sugar destroys so of course what i would recommend regardless of what stage the person is at would be to get on a healthy keto plan immediately of course if you five you adjustments with certain um nutrients like potassium and phosphorus but the combination of intermittent fasting with healthy keto with other things as well like this is a really really good herb that has been shown to decrease creatine to improve the filtration rate of the kidneys and i a link down below to show some incredible hardcore data on the benefits of astragalus on the kidney it helping to reverse kidney damage all right thanks for watching	Success
Melancholy Â The Real Cause of Melancholic Depression Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzrV24c7ew0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we melancholy and the real cause so melancholy is sadness depression it comes from the greek word which means black bile now that black bile well during the medieval period melancholy was one of the four temperaments and that had to do with different behaviors or characteristics and if you look at more of the temperament of melancholy you also get three additional symptoms which gives huge clues on what bloating we get distension and constipation now this to me and this indicates there going on with the gallbladder so if you do a search on the gallbladder in relationship or associated with depression you is what greater risk for depression by 80 percent now why would someone with gallstones be more depressed we second next point removal of the gallbladder can potentially decrease the risk for depression by 20 why is that and low-fat diets okay increase the risk of depression why well this is why fat especially saturated fat triggers the release of bile gall gallstones come from a lack of bile removing the gallbladder let stones in there and that can increase the flow so that could decrease the risk of depression by a certain amount what do all these indicators point to including all three of these a lack of bile a bile deficiency a bile deficiency will cause gall stones a low-fat diet will also cause a bile deficiency all right so now what between bile and your mood if you don going to absorb vitamin d and vitamin d deficiency will create serious depression also if you don going to absorb this omega-3 fatty acid dha when you can you could not only have severe depression but your risk of suicide goes up so there the fat that you eat and the fat that is broken down and gets absorbed getting the right amount of certain fats and also because vitamin d is a fat soluble vitamin you need bile to be able to absorb it if you have melancholy or you vitamin d or dha but remember these don without bile so you may just benefit from some purified bile salts thanks for watching hey we recipe no grains no sugar totally keto there suffering in keto absolutely not karen and it system builder absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it but is it simple it hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating it	Success
Vitamin D Testing Challenges	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBcg6sNREXE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so in this video i want to touch on vitamin d testing challenges okay the big the big problem with vitamin d is that there upon value of what you should have in your blood i mean they have an idea or estimation and we can range all the way from this value right here to this value right here depending on what units you use could range from this value to this value i guess you can take an average of these numbers depending on what units you also the institute of medicine will tell you that you need between 600 to 800 ius of vitamin d every day yet the endocrinology society will say you need a thousand to 200 ius every day so again there of agreement on how much you need or how much should be in your blood a couple things i want to talk about that are very very important though there inactive form 25 hydroxy vitamin d so it form which is 125 dihydroxy vitamin d so this is the active form this is the inactive form the way this works and by the way most of the vitamin d in your blood is the pre-inactive version and many times what they they 25 hydroxy vitamin d they precursor or the inactive vitamin d okay put that to the side we back to it so what happens is you have the pre-vitamin d that goes through the body and goes through the liver and from the liver it then goes to the kidney the kidney is the primary site for conversion of the inactive to the active version of vitamin d what if there is damage to the kidney you capacity and how many people have damage to the kidney well what damage is a kidney diabetes is a is a big thing but also insulin resistance what percentage of the population has insulin resistance i would say between 65 to 75 of the entire population that is going to alter the ability for the kidney to convert the inactive to the active when you get your test back from the lab that says your 5-hydroxy vitamin d is within normal levels well what about the active form are you getting a 100 conversion by the kidney is there any problem with the kidney that it defect in the vitamin d receptors called polymorphism and even though you may have normal vitamin d in your blood it being activated because at the receptor level it also if there body you won there you won make the conversion if there could be bile deficient so you going to have enough bile to make the conversion we already mentioned about insulin resistance if there inflammation in the body that can lower your ability to convert vitamin d if there let antibiotics as a child and that created scarring of your in your colon that can create a decreased capacity for conversion if you had a gastric bypass that could also alter your ability to convert vitamin d so as you can see there are many different variables so you have to look at the big picture what i tell people is to err on the side of taking more vitamin d than less and make sure you have enough bile so you can actually get the absorption all right i hope i didn add more confusion but i wanted to clear up some of these variables and the point of this video was just to mention that just because this right here is normal doesn fully converted to the active form hey we recipe no brains no sugar totally keto there suffering in keto absolutely not karen and it absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it to be keto but is it simple it hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating it you	Success
Does Skipping Meals Worsen Your Metabolism?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbWaj-NfbvM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	does skipping meals actually worsen your metabolism i about that in this video fasting or intermittent fasting less frequent meals equals a decrease in insulin insulin is a hormone that controls a certain enzyme okay it it anytime you see ace that describes the word lipids which is fats so fat dissolving enzyme okay the way you trigger this which is the fat-burning enzyme is you lower insulin we go from fat to energy so insulin is the key hormone that controls that if we have high insulin we inhibit this we block this enzyme so no fat can be burned so by lowering insulin you increase the three most powerful fat burning hormones too so this will help burn fat from another angle growth hormone glucagon and noradrenaline if we take a look at the high insulin conditions we have pcos okay polycystic ovarian syndrome what high insulin do they have a slow metabolism absolutely yes obesity people that are obese have a slow metabolism why because they have high insulin metabolic syndrome or syndrome x same thing when you have blood sugar issues like diabetes high blood pressure obesity it they of high insulin do we have a slow metabolism here yes we do okay diabetes do we have high insulin yes we do do we have a slow metabolism absolutely and then we have cushing syndrome this is a situation where you have high levels of cortisol where you have this belly fat a lot of times these guys get diabetes why because the high level of insulin a lot of the protein in the body is being converted into glucose which is raising insulin now on the flip side how do you slow your metabolism down very simply start consuming frequent small meals that are high in carbohydrates and low in calories this would be the classic diets that you the 80s and even the 90s but recently the shift has gone more keto low carb even a lot of these weight loss programs that used to be high carb are now going low carb or at least having types of products that are low carb like slim fast for example they have keto friendly shakes now so it interesting that everything is shifting to low carb a little bit higher fat the skipping meals actually slow your metabolism no they increase the metabolism if you keep your carbs low hey we recipe no grains no sugar totally keto there suffering in pita absolutely not karen and it system builder absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it simple it making it as much as we are enjoying eating it	Success
Arch Supports Can Worsen Your Flat Feet Â Dr. Berg's Opinion on Arch Support for Flat Feet	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-VIZLcqb28	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we supports and how they can actually make someone now growing up i had flat feet really bad and for years i tried every single arch support custom orthotics you name it and reflecting back on the actual cause of flat feet my theory is that it manganese deficiency at birth or a vitamin d deficiency that sets up a child with either a weakened structure of the arch or a bone malformation i had constant problems with my feet through sports track and field wrestling and even the army i really never felt a lot of relief when i would have this arch support they take a mold of your flat foot and then they customize a an orthotic that matches the fallen arch all i know is it didn was constantly massaging that arch to try to get some relief i think it was like i was 22 years old where i went to someone that did foot massage and oh my goodness did i get some relief with that but they actually really worked the muscles on the front part of the shin which was extremely painful but when they were done it was like i was walking on air at that point i stopped wearing the arches and my feet start feeling better and i would start to massage the foot as well and then a few years later i started doing stretches not the usual stretches of the calf but i stretch the other part of the leg where you take your toes and you stretch them down which i will demonstrate in a minute looking back at what i did i didn but all i knew is when i stretched the front part of the leg it gave way more relief than stretching the calf so if the bottom of the arch or the bottom of the foot is cramping and you stretch the muscles on the top part of the foot that stem right up into the front part of the leg you will send signals to the muscle that that will relax the muscle so that it works so you don the tight muscle you want to work on the opposite side so i now check out this little part of this video so take the toes and we stretch them like this we about 10 times and we stretching this whole muscle right through in here what that will do that will give the foot the signals are sent to relax the bottom of the foot it a lot of relief okay so we stretch that okay so that would be the stretch of what you would want to do if you had fallen arches it will give you a lot of relief you just do it every single day second thing i would recommend finding someone that specializes in a foot massage and have them work not just on the foot but on the front part of the lower leg you will get so much relief and number three take those arches out and allow your feet to strengthen on their own you little handicap the little arch that the muscles in the lower part of the leg will adapt and they stronger and they somewhat of an arch there and you will get way more relief go ahead and try this and then comment down below hey we recipe no brains no sugar totally keto there suffering in keto absolutely not karen and it system builder absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it keto but is it simple it we hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating it	Success
Get Rid of Stiffness and Feel a Lot Younger Â Muscle Soreness & Stiffness Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_kVwG2wFWI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let stiffness in your body and feel younger again uh when i was 28 i was very very stiff i felt very very old i felt like i was in my 50s now i in my 50s i i issues going on and i was consuming a lot of carbohydrates and that is something that i assume that everyone knows about if you stiffen your joints up and create all sorts of inflammation so i know that we other common causes of stiffness one is too much iron okay so iron creates a lot of inflammation it creates problems in your liver and iron comes from many sources like a lot of things are fortified with iron especially if you grains which i don even pasta and things like that also supplements some of the top multivitamin mineral complexes come with way too much iron iron doesn from our bodies very well especially in men and accumulates and it creates fibrosis and inflammation and eventually even cirrhosis of the liver but it will definitely stiffen you up so what you want to do is avoid iron now if you have a problem with excess iron you also want to probably avoid red meat because it it notice your inflammation will start coming down okay number two so-called vegetable oils are really seed oils they and you want to avoid them corn soy canola cotton seed also safflower and sunflower or omega-6 these are omega-6 fatty acids and they and they solvents and these are gmo as well and they can create a lot of stiffness in your body so you want to avoid these for sure you want to replace them especially when you butter and maybe olive oil and coconut oil on your salad you can use olive oil but just realize that the majority of olive oil sold out there is not pure olive oil and i put a link down below of a video that i did in olive oil so you can have all the data on that but the point is that if you enough omega-3 you create a lot of inflammation in the body and stiffness there that you can do to pick up your ratios but i suggest you start consuming more fatty fish sardines cod of oil and fish oil be careful about fish oils do not do like some low quality fish oil you want to do something high-end because you get what you pay for and there lot of bad things in these very inexpensive fish oils that you want to avoid so you want to get a high quality collard oil that you can get but the point is that this will give you the omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acid deficiencies create inflammation pain and stiffness so if you or you omega-3 fatty acids mostly come from fish sardines you can get them from algae but you would have to get that in a supplement but the point is that these are essential fatty acids they important and if you don that can create inflammation right there because you omega-3 fatty acids and the two primary ones i focus on are dha and epa so just by taking this you that your stiffness will be much better probably within one to two weeks next one is increasing vitamin k2 what is that that is a type of vitamin that drives calcium out of the joints out of soft tissue into the bone and it works with vitamin d3 vitamin d3 also helps inflammation in your muscle and it gets rid of pain in your joints as well so you might get great benefit by taking d3 and i always like to take them together what do we see as a common thread between this one and this one and this one well we if you have difficulty digesting fats okay because there something going on with your gallbladder what you the essential fatty acids from the cod liver oil or the fish oil or even the fatty fish so you people who have stiffness pain and inflammation and even fibromyalgia from a gallbladder problem and it usually going to be on the right side in fact it right side on the left side it probably going to be more of a pancreatic type thing because the pancreas and the gallbladder work together the gallbladder concentrates bile bile is only made by your liver primary bile is made by your liver secondary is made by your friendly bacteria in your large intestine but what happens is the bile is created it goes down to the gallbladder where it and then when you eat it be released and it down the fats into smaller particles where now the pancreas can release lipase its enzyme to take it down to even smaller particles so then your body can absorb it in the small intestine so a lot of the fat is absorbed in the small intestine and then if we keep going in the small intestine right before we hit the large intestine that supposed to be reabsorbed and recycled so bile is recycled about 95 percent so if there in that part of your small intestine then you deficient as well so you can be bile deficient from a problem in your liver the gallbladder your intestine or the large colon so there you might be deficient in bile the point is that if you deficient in bile you stiff despite taking these remedies right here and so i going to put some links down below to increase your awareness of the gallbladder in relationship to pain and inflammation stiffness but i had that problem for 12 years i didn until one day i learned about it and never had pain there ever again a good indicator to know if you have a gallbladder problem is a fullness or tightness underneath the right rib cage the remedy is to take purified balance salts if you want more information i put a link down below on that but bile will help the absorption of these right here so stiffness a lot of times is related to a lack of a certain fat or the digestion of a certain fat all right thanks for watching hey we recipe no brains no sugar totally keto there suffering in keto absolutely not karen and it absolutely you have to check this

Do This for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Â Omega 3 Fatty Acids For ADHD Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf27HdWFzj0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we to do for adhd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder it okay there this is a genetic problem in fact this might surprise you but it not a ritalin deficiency and from my viewpoint it mental disease this is purely a nutritional deficiency the symptoms are low attention focus you can restlessness visual learning problems difficulty reading and remembering now there i found that i below it they it double-blinded placebo-controlled trial so check it out and there was significant improvements in adhd using high doses of something called epa okay now they actually use a combination of epa and dha at least 750 milligrams of this combination every single day for 12 weeks and this is very easy to find at any health food store or online and i specific brands so you that out but if you have adhd you need to be taking this combination right here if you can find one that a little heavier in the epa to dha that may work a little bit better now what is epa and what is dha well collectively these are the omega-3 fatty acids you have omega-3 fatty acids and you also have omega-6 fatty acids collectively these are called essential fatty acids and what that means is that your body can the diet here differentiating the importance of omega-3 versus omega 6. they omega-3 is way more important than omega-6 yet the ratios of these fats in an average person is 16-1 okay so that six in fact over a hundred million metric tons and a ton is two thousand pounds is extracted and used in our food supply every single year versus 4 million metric tons of omega-3 this is what omega-3 fatty acids have anti-psychotic properties they help your cognitive function they improve your iq there genes that have to do just with brain development they have the potential of increasing dopamine serotonin and protecting your neurons so if you can imagine having enough omega-3 for your brain to work you right here now as a side note if you have restlessness or your child has restlessness or even hyperactivity i would add in there vitamin b1 in the form of nutritional yeast or just some natural b1 because b1 deficiencies will easily cause these two symptoms right here if your child has this or you have this start taking this combination at least 750 milligrams every single day plus start reducing this right here omega-6 fatty acids if you put a link down below with another video i did so you can be aware of that you can start to cut all those things out of your diet and once you do this come back to this video and comment down below of your success i want to hear it hey we recipe no grains no sugar totally keto there suffering in keto absolutely not karen and it absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it to be keto but is it simple it hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating it you	Success
Osteoporosis Is Not a Calcium Deficiency Â Remedies for Osteoporosis Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD7T5GF6b28	Dr. Eric Berg DC	osteoporosis is not a calcium deficiency problem so many people have in their mind that if i have osteoporosis i need to start drinking a lot of milk start taking calcium so they start taking like 500 milligrams of calcium carbonate every day expecting their osteoporosis to magically go away well there interesting data that talks about calcium supplementation not only not helping you with osteoporosis or reducing their fractures from osteoporosis but increasing the risk for heart attacks and even stroke and i some links down below one study talked about if you took 500 milligrams of calcium every day it potentially could increase the risk of heart attacks by 30 percent and risk of getting a stroke by 20 percent now in a review from 2018 using the routine use of calcium and vitamin d did not reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures but it did increase the risk of kidney stones now the thing about calcium is that it very very tightly regulated so if you get too much calcium it becomes very very toxic very similar to too much iron or too much copper versus other minerals like magnesium or potassium you can get a lot of that and your body will get rid of it but not calcium too much calcium is very toxic to your cells and if you look at certain health conditions as people get older they calcium extra calcium that lodges in their arteries in the joints thirty percent of the population in the u.s has calcification in the arteries and there uh that you can take i down below and it artery calcification test so that overall mortality too much calcium could lead to all sorts of problems there i want to make you aware of milk alkali syndrome this is a condition where the person is consuming too much calcium and it could be from drinking too much milk or taking an antacid here are the side effects kidney failure death psychosis confusion dizziness poor appetite and the list goes on and on and on so what i recommend is you get your calcium from your food as much as possible and never take calcium carbonate because your body is a heck of a time absorbing that osteoporosis is a severe loss of bone mass and density and bone is made from protein minerals and calcium as well it just calcium so it a lesser version of that and then osteomalacia is where the bones become soft and in a child it and this is a vitamin d deficiency what than calcium is your vitamin d level is your stress level too much chronic stress or taking steroids prednisone for example will destroy the bones post menopausal women who go through a lot of stress and go through a lot of menopause with adrenal stress because now the adrenals have to back up the ovaries sometimes develop osteoporosis from a combination of higher levels of cortisol and lower levels of estrogen so that can cause a loss of bone also if you have digestive issues malabsorption can create a problem usually because you vitamin d and then you can calcium vitamin d has a purpose of increasing calcium absorption by 20 times so without vitamin d you would have to consume 20 times the quantity of calcium that doesn make sense vitamin k2 is another vitamin that is ignored this is like vitally important vitamin k2 has a huge purpose of making your bones very very strong and solid to keep the calcium in the bone and keep it out of the arteries and the other soft tissues so this right here is probably one of the most important factors in dealing with someone with osteoporosis the other thing that proven is that regular exercise can greatly reduce the risk of osteoporosis you want to keep your stress low make sure you get a lot of sun or you can take vitamin d3 k2 eat very healthy so you can get the minerals from the food i mean one good source of calcium is leafy greens another source is some high quality grass-fed organic cheese so in this video i just wanted to increase your awareness that osteoporosis is not just a calcium deficiency it and i don of what they normally recommend calcium carbonate because of this problem right here which i thanks for watching hey we recipe no grains no sugar totally keto there suffering in keto absolutely not karen and it system builder absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it but is it simple it hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating it	Success

WhatÂs Really Behind Chronic Fatigue, Achiness and Stiffness Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQwimsKpZqw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let achiness and stiffness many times this is coming from what mycoplasma now what is a mycoplasma it very small microbe probably one of the smallest known microbes nanobacteria might be a little bit smaller but they family you see these microorganisms involved with secondary infections you see them with lyme even hiv they don very stealth your immune system has a very difficult time finding them and antibiotics may not work they may help initially but then this mycoplasma keeps coming back and it rheumatoid arthritis and it can even trigger various autoimmune diseases it symptoms the gulf war syndrome fibromyalgia and i already mentioned lyme is there anything you can do naturally because the problematically is that the treatment usually destroys your own immune system and then that weakens your ability to fight this microbe you definitely have to go low carb why because mycoplasmas live on glucose and other carbohydrates so it fasting is essential because it will help strengthen the immune system especially if you do periodic prolonged fasting so let hours every two weeks or every month or even 72 hours that would be very beneficial as well as fasting autophagy which will help clean up and kill microorganisms in the body and recycle them the herbs that are recommended and they with very minimal if any side effects ban land gen angelica root hang bay and garlic now these will have a tendency to potentially detoxify you unless you also consume bile salts before you start this so i would do bile salts for the first day just do two per day on an empty stomach spread out like do one in the morning one at night what this will do it allow drainage it want to do before a detox then you start adding these in there and then also continue to take this along the way because sometimes when you start killing off microbes you release endotoxins and endotoxins have the capacity to shut down your bile flow and then you get this backup of toxins to the blood and you can actually get all sorts of detox reactions so bile salts help to reduce the side effects from detoxification okay so number four zinc at least 100 milligrams per day this is going to strengthen your immune system and vitamin d3 30 000 ius per day that reduce inflammation what after about a week is your energy is going to start to come up you less achy less stiff more joint mobility and realize that you may need to do this protocol for several months to really stabilize your health all right thanks for watching hey we recipe no grains no sugar totally keto there suffering in keto absolutely not karen and it absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it to be keto but is it simple it hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating it	Success

6 Things Muscles Tell You About Your Nutrient Status	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBGp2gVuEok	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we six things that your muscles will tell you about your nutrient status fairly quick video but very very um important if you have any problem with your muscles the muscle is an organ and it indicator of all sorts of nutritional deficiencies in the body let through it all right number one if you have pain in your muscle or inflammation it could be vitamin d deficiency most people are deficient in vitamin d it and especially if you have low back pain in general maybe not necessarily in the muscles but just low back pain take vitamin d because vitamin d is a great anti-inflammatory and it will definitely get rid of muscle pain itself okay next thing is low recovery from exercise so you work out but you the soreness it takes way too long it could be an omega-3 fatty acid deficiency i fish oils cod liver oil you can also get your omega-3 from algae and this is very common as well a lot of people don they don definitely don and so they they may notice that when they work out it their recovery is very very low okay next thing is burning in the muscles and this would also be restless leg syndrome that could be a condition called lactic acidosis where there acid in the muscle believe it or not i used to have this in my 20s really bad with my lower legs i would wake up in the middle of night with my legs burning and feeling very very energetic and i had to go run in the middle of the night to get this energy out this is a classic vitamin b1 deficiency where does this come from well too many refined carbohydrates and sugars guilty as charged i used to do a ton of sugar and ice cream right before bed and i always wondered why to get up in the middle of night and have to you know have this burning in my legs so it carbohydrate metabolism nutritional yeast is is the key with that and avoid the sugar okay and the burning will go away so vitamin b1 gets rid of lactic acid next thing is twitching or tetany so you have a little twitch you know underneath your eyelid or an arm it that could take calcium and i always recommend taking like a calcium lactate or a calcium magnesium type combination not calcium carbonate but here enough calcium foods like some cheese or even calcium in the vegetables it could be not a problem with calcium it could be that you just too alkaline if you you depositing on the nerves creating a little twitching and so what you can do is just take apple cider vinegar and that should get rid of the twitching very very quickly now where does this come from this comes from the overconsumption of refined carbohydrates and sugar as well as stress those stress in carbs will create this state right here now you probably were thinking it of an acidic state but in actuality it can create more of an alkaline state so it alkaline cramps in the muscle that potassium deficiency magnesium deficiency or a sodium deficiency so you need salt or these electrolytes okay i then go to here or just take all of these together next one this is quite amazing if your muscles are weak and you just feel like you go up a flight of stairs and you i don move or your legs get heavier or you just have weak muscles vitamin e is the fastest thing to make a weak muscle strong the the type of vitamin e that you need is tocatrinals okay you can get a blend of tocopherols and tocatrinals but if you have the option i would get the tocatrinos because they work pretty fast and normally you can get the tocopherols which is like alpha beta delta gamma you can get that from your food very easily but it the other part of the vitamin e complex to katrina gamma from the food so you can take that and notice how strong your muscles get this can really be helpful during exercise as well so these are the one two three four five six things that your muscles can tell you about your nutrient status	Success
The First Sign of Low Vitamin D Â Symptoms of Vitamin D Deficiency Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZPq1mSgUlk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so let symptom that usually occurs if you vitamin d it is low back ache but i really want to emphasize this because this is so powerful if you have low back pain and you when you taking enough vitamin d you before you get any relief so let between vitamin d and your lower back vitamin d is necessary for your immune system it pressure to keep keep it on the low side it important sleep and your mood but it as an anti-inflammatory and to help you get rid of pain one of the first signs of low vitamin d is the achiness in your lumbar spine especially at night so really good demonstration to see if you fit in this category is simply to squat down and get up from a squatted position or even from a seated position and stand up and rate your difficulty then you would take 40 000 ius of vitamin d3 and wait about an hour and then re-rate your difficulty from a squatted position or see the position standing up and you should see a significant improvement if this is your problem now most people if they deficient will notice a change within about an hour but if some people are are so deficient it could take a day or two before they see the results so sometimes you might want to wait a little bit longer to really know that it so low back pain or achiness especially at night hard time getting out from a seated position or from a squatted position what happens is that from the lower back it kind of spreads to the pelvis kind of all over stiff achy pain then it goes into the hip joints okay and then it goes into the upper legs the thigh muscles uh usually symmetrical both of them at the same time it then can go into the upper arms as well it usually affects the proximal muscles which are the muscles that are closest to the midline or the trunk it can also cause bone pain of the ribs especially when you press on either your shin the front part of your lower leg or your breastbone right through and here that could be one indication that you also vitamin d affects the muscle tone so you may find that your gait you waddling back and forth if you ever see people like kind of rocking back and forth as they walking just go up to them and recommend vitamin d vitamin d is in cod liver oil fatty fish eggs and dairy but it almost impossible for you to get your vitamin d from your diet you need to get it from the sun and if you can take it as a supplement i recommend if you have these symptoms 40 000 iu vitamin d3 it might be good to take it with a meal go ahead and do this demonstration and comment down below i want to i want to read your results hey we recipe no brains no sugar totally keto there suffering in keto absolutely not karen and it system builder absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it but is it simple it hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating it	Success
Common Drugs That Deplete Vitamin D	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBNslzE6CP8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so recently i was doing some research on the drugs that deplete vitamin d i just found some interesting things i want to share with you um corticosteroids like prednisone normally are used as an anti-inflammatory right well here of the best anti-inflammatories problem is when you take cortical steroids you creating more inflammation and need for more corticosteroids number two antibiotics certain antibiotics block your absorption of vitamin d and vitamin d is needed to strengthen the junctions of the cells in your colon so without vitamin d you create leaky gut so when you take antibiotics block vitamin d and now we integrity of the gut barrier increasing our chance of getting autoimmune diseases and allergies and things like that now when someone takes an antibiotic for tb for example that creates a vitamin d deficiency but one of the common treatments that they used for tb before they had antibiotics was cod liver oil and sunshine vitamin d because they found that it actually helped this condition and all those antibiotics that are taken for bronchial infections and respiratory infections which then block vitamin d increase your susceptibility of getting another infection in the bronchial area because you have a lot of vitamin d receptors in the upper and lower respiratory areas in your sinuses and your lungs and they extensive immune protection and the very reason why you even get an infection and you need antibiotics is because you deficient now antidepressants block vitamin d one of the most therapeutic things for vitamin d is to help you with depression so here you are taking a drug for depression or anxiety and it thereby making you dependent on that drug as soon as you try to get off of it you you can barbitol this is used as an anti-anxiety and for seizures well guess what vitamin d does it helps reduce stress it helps anxiety and it decreases the risk of seizures so again here vitamin d create a vitamin d deficiency and now we make it worse okay dilatin is also used for seizures same thing it blocks vitamin d all right number six cholesteroamine this is a medication that blocks bile if someone has too much bile and it also blocks cholesterol so cholesterol is needed to make bile and vitamin d and this medication definitely blocks the ability to make vitamin d so you deficient if you number seven we have ulcer medications a big cause of ulcers is the microbe h pylori there great research that showed that vitamin d produced a 77.2 eradication of h pylori which is going to help the person so i just found it interesting that the reason you would need these medications in the first place is your vitamin d deficient the problem is when you take them you create a vitamin d deficiency so it so if you have any symptoms you may want to try taking some vitamin d thanks for watching hey we recipe no grains no sugar totally keto there suffering in keto absolutely not karen and it system builder absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it but is it simple it hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating it	Success
Best Vitamin for Emotional Instability Â Vitamin B1 & Delirium Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fKf2GcNJCE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let emotional instability now there are other causes of emotional instability that have nothing to do with your nutrition i nutrient connection to your emotions it if you experience emotional instability and delirium what is that it confusion and emotional disruption which also occurs frequently when an alcoholic is going through withdrawal symptoms or even a drug addict goes through these withdrawal symptoms now there are certain specific parts of your brain that require vitamin b1 here they are the hippocampus which has a lot to do with your memory and also like a relay switch with your emotions the amygdala which has a lot to do with stress responses very similar to the adrenal but in your brain needs b1 because of course stress depletes b1 and the mammillary bodies which are two structures in the brain which not only can influence emotions but also spatial memory your ability to remember where locations are in time and space so let time finding some location because you don you don you where to go and you sure how to get there that so these three structures need a lot of b1 to function another interesting thing is when you electrically stimulate nerves within these structures they give off a high rate of vitamin b1 80 times more than resting nerves the more that you structures the more b1 is necessary the rdas for b1 is only 2 milligrams b1 is water-soluble so you don store a lot of it and your body needs a small amount of it but it needs it consistently so if you or you go through a lot of stress or a lot of refined foods or even chlorine that can also deplete your b1 now your b1 needs also depend on the amount of carbohydrates the more carbohydrates the more sugar you going to need now what you need 4700 milligrams and b1 you only need two milligrams so again you don it consistently other symptoms that a b1 deficiency will create would be irritability depression anxiety confusion memory loss lack of initiative poor ability to learn and poor concentration the best source of b1 is nutritional yeast if you highly recommend you don synthetic version you get a natural version but if you get an unfortified or unenriched nutritional yeast that will have enough b1 all right thanks for watching hey we recipe no brains no sugar totally keto there suffering in keto absolutely not karen and it system builder absolutely you have to check this out i think you should hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it but is it simple it hope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating it you	Success
Subclinical vs. Clinical Disease	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoXvvBv9NJg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today i want to increase your awareness on the term subclinical okay so let subclinical means it if any symptoms and no clinical findings that means you go to the doctor get a blood test everything comes out normal okay whereas a clinical disease you have symptoms and you have clinical findings you get a blood test you find out some problem on your blood test what i want to tell you is that a lot of health problems especially the ones right here diabetes hypothyroidism adrenal disease kidney disease and especially liver disease start out as a subclinical problem and then transition into a clinical issue so you have the beginning of a liver problem or a blood sugar problem years before it shows up with certain testing now you may notice some slight fatigue stiffness inflammation but you might consider that normal when in fact it symptoms of one of these right here so let before you become even a pre-diabetic you are you have insulin resistance and there test it this is rarely ever done by your doctor but it diabetes runs in your family because this will pick up resistance and they your insulin levels okay while you the things that they measure which comes way before you become even a pre-diabetic or diabetic where you have abnormal blood sugars so this would be a test that done that would pick up the beginning part of diabetes basically you can call it subclinical diabetes now when we get into hypothyroidism i believe doing a hair analysis from a credible lab would give you some very important information about the selenium status zinc status and iodine status of the entire body which may not show up in your blood because when you zinc and iodine it can turn into a hypothyroid condition also high levels of estrogen let have heavy periods or you things like that that could lead to a hypothyroid condition or if you have liver problems you had your gallbladder removed you lead into a hypothyroid condition because it understand the evolution of these body conditions what causes these conditions and that best way to do it is to avoid those things that can potentially cause these problems this right here is the chronic consumption of carbohydrates eating too frequently this could be a mineral deficiency or it could be stress or it can be too much exposure to fluoride for example now when you check the blood for certain minerals especially potassium and magnesium uh rarely will it show up being a problem in the blood because 98 or 99 of those two minerals are inside the cell so you have to understand that and know what tests to do because a blood test might not be the best thing in that case maybe you want to do an intracellular mineral test i company that i and this will pick up mineral deficiencies which could then lead into heart arrhythmia problems down the road a cac scan test coronary artery calcification test where you calcium inside the artery is a very good test to predict heart attacks down the road not that expensive pretty quick you want a score of a zero another good test to look at the deeper areas of your lipids cholesterol hdl ldl would be the advanced lipid testing which would give you a much better picture of what going on inside the arteries because this is going to measure the type of ldl that would not create artery damage and the type of ldl that would create damage in the inside of the arteries now with adrenal disease a lot of times adrenal problems do not show up until the majority of the gland is destroyed especially with a condition called addison autoimmune condition so one test to pick this up would be an antibody test to the adrenal glands so you may have the symptoms of adrenal issues but when you do a blood test like nothing shows up with your hormones and this is very very common with any hormone problems i believe they all start out subclinically and then they eventually turn into a clinical problem and so you really have to be aware of the mechanism because if you don that and you put all your focus on this blood test yet you ignore these other symptoms that could be related and really don subclinical part of it then you could really miss a problem because you before it becomes a bigger problem kidney disease is a common subclinical issue one indicator is creatine on a blood test your kidney has to be pretty severely damaged before that shows up so you may have normal indicators on a blood test yet have this start of a kidney disease a huge percentage of kidney disease starts with insulin resistance and blood sugar problems so again if you understand the mechanism and the evolution of what causes what you can even avoid these issues right here instead of waiting to become diagnosed liver disease your liver is very robust and 90 of liver can be literally damaged yet you have no symptoms at all a really good indicator for a fatty liver would be a gut so a lot of times people look at you know having a large gut that normal thing everyone has it it problem and not realizing that the liver is so fatty that the fat now is spilling over in other organs around the organs in your mid section and they dots between a fatty liver and gut fat so you may not have other symptoms but you may have a gut and that means you have a fatty liver when i was in practice i sent five of my patients to the radiologist for ultrasounds of their liver and five out of five of these men that i sent over for this evaluation had significant amounts of fat in their liver so let others and avoid these problems over here by getting on a healthy keto and an intermittent fasting program if you down below of exactly what you should be doing thanks for watching before

Bones Are Way More Than Calcium - OKAY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG-ac-3sBPg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you know i just cringe when i see certain people taking a huge bottle of calcium carbonate for their osteoporosis they a thousand milligrams of calcium every single day hoping to cure their osteoporosis well bones are much more than calcium and when you take that much calcium it when you start taking more calcium like that especially calcium carbonate we start increasing the risk of heart attacks so what i want to do is i want to kind of show you all the different factors that are needed to actually support your bone first let definition of three common bone problems osteomalacia in children they call that rickets okay where you have this the bones get really soft in adults they call it osteomalacia instead of vitamin d deficiency so if you don have enough vitamin d your bones become very soft osteopenia is a kind of a mild version of osteoporosis we have severe bone loss with a breakdown of collagen 35 of bone is collagen it and so if you and you get this spike in cortisol cortisol is a very destructive hormone it creates a catabolic effect on proteins not just your muscles but your bone as well so your osteoporosis or osteopenia could be more of a catabolic effect from the collagen in fact i don it that calcium is a mineral that our body tends to retain more than other minerals so you have the body retains calcium iron a lot more than other minerals like zinc which is a trace mineral or potassium or magnesium so calcium is usually not a vitamin deficiency there why you breaking down the collagen in the bone or losing the bone mass so osteopenia is like a stage that comes before osteoporosis so there osteoporosis a shift in hormones hypogonadism so let ovaries out that can create a huge shift in estrogen and progesterone and that can cause osteopenia and then osteoporosis now even in men when they get older they testosterone and they a shift in estrogen even though estrogen is not very high in a male body it health men need a very small amount of estrogen so estrogen and progesterone together are vitally important in bone health too much is a problem and too little is a problem you also have magnesium which is very important for bone structure and magnesium also helps vitamin d work in bone in the other parts of the body vitamin d in general it has to do with mineralization of the bone then you have vitamin k1 which has to do with clotting but it also will help you form bone as well as k2 vitamin k2 has everything to do with calcium binding and making your bones very very strong and keeping calcium out of the soft tissues out of the joints and out of your arteries and pushing into the bone boron is a trace mineral avocados have a good amount of boron fyi and boron helps strengthen your bone zinc very very important in inhibiting bone loss even if you had your ovaries removed but there five different mechanisms where zinc will help your bones you need phosphorus in the bones manganese see i mentioned a lot of these trace minerals like zinc boron and manganese you don but they in enzymes that help make body tissue especially bone so manganese is very important in collagen and cartilage mineralization in bone and around the ends of bone if you have osteopenia if you have osteoporosis realize to get your bone back it take seven or ten years but you want to start taking trace minerals you want to start taking other minerals you want to start to eat healthy to start getting these hormones back into shape but one thing you don is just take a bunch of calcium carbonate which just is going to fill up your arteries and create a lot of problems with your heart alright thanks for watching	Success

K2 Inhibits Vascular and Joint Calcification	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHXiGFusTEU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	i vitamin d but i vitamin k2 so this video is on k2 vitamin k2 is quite amazing it inhibits vascular and joint calcification it keeps your joints and your arteries from becoming bone so vitamin k2 which is a fat soluble vitamin activates an inhibitory protein it what this protein does is it stops it pads okay it stops calcium from forming in the arteries and in your joints vitamin k2 also helps form bone it makes your bones more mineralized okay so it makes the bones stronger vitamin k2 decreases insulin resistance now we know insulin resistance is involved in damaging the arteries that the calcification in the first place as well as the inflammation the joints which is behind arthritis and bursitis and tendinitis so vitamin k2 is extremely powerful in not just keeping the calcium out of the wrong place but putting it back in the right place as well as inhibiting the very root cause of why it it powerful you want to take vitamin d3 with k2 so if you of vitamin d3 we want k2 at 100 micrograms okay that recommend now this is mk7 there k2 this video is not going to be on that topic but let should be eating to raise your vitamin k2 liver animal liver which also includes pate right here goose pate has some of the highest levels of k2 fermented foods have vitamin k2 especially nato which is a japanese fermented soybean product nato has not just mk and mk is just a version of k2 mk4 mk5 mk6 mk7 and 8 so it has a lot of different types of k2 grass-fed meat has vitamin k2 egg yolks have vitamin k2 hard and soft cheese has the mk4 version the 5 the 6 seven eight and the nine salami has vitamin k2 make sure you get the version that does not have sugar or dextrose i found one from the healthy store so that consume and sauerkraut has k2 it has a lot of different types the mk 4 5 6 7 8 and 9. and grass fed butter has k2 it has the version 4 5 6 7 8 9 as well so it summary you can see how vitally important k2 is for a lot of different things thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you know how to begin keto or you because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Psoriasis Treatment Â The Best 3 Remedies for Psoriasis Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSYto3FAJUA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let for psoriasis if you have psoriasis you definitely need to watch this entire video i put a tremendous amount of research into this topic to summarize it to make it extremely simple and to hopefully help you so there can do that are non-toxic the greek word for psoriasis comes from sora means itchy and iastis means action or condition so it condition psoriasis is an autoimmune condition where your body is producing antibodies against itself so the symptoms of psoriasis are coming from your own immune system and certain parts of your skin are replaced every three to five days instead of every 28 to 30 days so we have this accelerated reproduction of skin cells and that the redness and the scaling and the little white flakes that are on the like the little plaque so here there is a t cell dysfunction the t cells are part of the immune system that system you develop it over time and there imbalance triggered usually by an altered microbiome either in your gut or a really really bad sore throat a strep throat or another infection and there several different types of t cells the one that is involved is the t helper cell th17 it and this happens to be your own immune cell that induces inflammation and autoimmune diseases and also it releases cytokines so it has an additional inflammatory signal on top of that now there regulatory cells that are involved in preventing autoimmune diseases in the first place and those are usually suppressed so we have a suppressed t regulatory cell and we have an increase in t helper cells th17 now if you do some research on this you data on the relationship between the t helper cell th17 and vitamin d vitamin d happens to be something that can suppress th17 and so this is very interesting because vitamin d is not really a vitamin it that acts like cortisol in the body which happens to be one of the big treatments for psoriasis prednisone and anti-inflammatory so vitamin d is a natural prednisone without the side effects the other interesting thing about this is that psoriasis is worse in the winter why because the vitamin d is going to be lower also there incidence of psoriasis the further you live from the equator and if you have psoriasis you greater risk for depression and one of the big root causes of depression is a vitamin d so we have vitamin d very very important i would recommend 40 000 iu every single day you need to take enough to penetrate sometimes the damage that that vitamin d there you have to take a little bit more now cod liver oil not only does cod live oil have vitamin d and vitamin a which is also good for the skin but it also has the omega-3 fatty acids dha and epa and one of the main symptoms of an omega-3 fatty acid deficiency is dry scaly red skin also omega-3 is an anti-inflammatory the last remedy is bile salts why because bile salts stimulate the vitamin d receptor bile salts allow vitamin d to work a lot better in the body so if there type of resistance let genetic alteration in your receptor for vitamin d it help potentially increase the absorption also bile salts directly modulate or control the t helper cell 17 the th17 cell so bile salts are going to help to regulate this dysfunction as well as stimulate the t regulatory cells that out it helps to calm down the inflammation so the type of bile salt i recommend for this would be tudka t-u-d-c-a i recommending a brand just get whatever you can find that has good views and take three to four per day it used to help you digest the dietary fat what we want to do is to take an empty stomach so it can actually focus on helping regulate the immune system and as far as the cod liver oil take whatever is recommended on the bottle that you buy and the last two things i recommend are fasting very very very important for all autoimmune conditions as well as no gluten at all in the diet so go ahead and apply this information and comment down below i want to hear your results before you go if you have a question about a product or you how to begin keto or you because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPNdAGBMph0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let obstructive pulmonary disease what does this word mean it means that there disease that takes a bit of time to develop that means you certain degree another name for copd is emphysema some of the symptoms there the most common ones are shortness of breath coughing mucus the problem with copd is it condition that eventually leads to pulmonary hypertension so you blood pressure that lungs and it the right ventricle that part of your heart it pushes all your blood to the entire body so as you stress the right part of that pump it you you so if you see swelling in your ankles then we know this is going on right here now if we take a look at what happening inside your lungs you have these little pouches called alveoli they look like little clusters of grapes okay normally they look like this when you have copd they look like this so you lose the shape of these little pouches because there irritation from either smoke or some other substance that constant inflammatory process this word comes from the latin word which means uh cavity because it pouch-like hole now the purpose of the alveoli is just to exchange certain gases it co2 from the blood and it the circulation oxygen so we have this exchange between oxygen and co2 so you have this very very thin lining of the alveoli that allows this diffusion to take place and right outside that thin layer you have these tiny little blood vessels called capillaries so we mixing in the oxygen with the blood so it acts sort of like a carburetor the carburetor is the lung of your engine where you actually pulling in oxygen mixing it with fuel with the right ratio a little spark plug and creating energy so the problem with copd is this chronic irritation creates inflammation in something called oxidation and oxidation is basically it rusting out effect of your your body tissue and the more the body rusts out it creates inflammation and it to try to heal incorrectly with too much scar tissue we call that fibrosis and so we get a thickening of this membrane and when the membrane becomes thicker you slowly lose your ability to exchange gases and get oxygen so you have more difficulty breathing so it basically shutting off the oxygen to this carburetor right here now one of the problem with this is that you also getting a buildup of co2 carbon dioxide and that affect your breathing because you breathing in something that smoke it not oxygen it other thing that irritate your lungs greatly in summary that about it there on this and it has to do with this right here oxidation at the heart of copd you massive amount of oxidation there just happens to be an anti-oxidant that can help stop this maybe even reverse it some of the studies were done in animals not in humans yet but it makes sense that it would work in humans as well and it has to do with a type of vitamin e now most people might associate vitamin e with tocopherols but fairly recently there was a a type of vitamin e called tocotrinols which is really in nature part of the vitamin e complex so you have tocotrienols and you have tocopherols the type of vitamin e that you would need to help reduce this oxidation would be the tocotrienols more than the tocopherols so you want to get a supplement that has a dosage of about 300 milligrams okay of tocotrienols only tocotrinols are 50 times stronger than the tocopherols so it this oxidation and other things that are very destructive in the lung tissue so your inflammation is going to come way down with tocotrienos and i would take 300 milligrams i would take that three times a day on an empty stomach so the goal with tocotrienols is to stop the oxidation inflammation so it doesn fibrosis but if you think about vitamin e in general what do people use it for they use it for scarring right so you why not just take it internally to reduce scarring too not just in your lungs but also in the liver there cirrhosis but you can also use it on copd to help break down some of the scarring in the lungs next remedy is vitamin d3 i would venture to say that a hundred percent of patients with copd are severely deficient in vitamin d you have a lot of receptors for vitamin d in the lung one of the treatments for copd is steroids okay like prednisone and other and other types of steroids that are like bronchosteroid inhalers because steroids are anti-inflammatory and vitamin d is the closest thing to that steroid cortisol that we about it acts like this anti-inflammatory but without the side effects it but you have to take enough so you want to take about 40 000 international units of vitamin d3 every single day okay that and help you breathe what intermittent fasting will do is drop your inflammation even more the more frequent you eat the more inflammation you your body the goal is to minimize the damage control and extend your life so we want to really attack this right here as much as possible because this is causing this cause effect so fasting is going to be necessary periodic prolonged fasting so a fasting of 72 hours let maybe every two weeks would greatly help you why because it going to increase stem cells stem cells are cells that don they kind of like basic cells that can turn into tissue like any different type of tissue so when you do prolong fasting your body will use these stem cells to replace the damaged tissue of your lungs and not only that it a tophagee autophagy is like a recycling action of your body in autophagy recycles damaged proteins fibrosis is a protein it to help recycle and break that down and use that as energy and through its recycling brand new tissue so fastening will help the lungs in various ways dropping inflammation and actually correcting some of this damage through here as well number four keto the way you do keto is you drop your carbohydrates and then your body starts to switch over into ketones from fat fuel ketones are very anti-inflammatory again another way to drop inflammation vitamin c not synthetic but from actual food or food concentrate vitamin c is another powerful anti-inflammatory and there which i that will increase your oxygen and decrease the co2 so this is very important as well osha root is a native american indian remedy for lung disorders so this is another great thing to consider right here all right what is the other problem with copd usually people develop it from smoking and sometimes they are still smoking even though they condition so it people to give up smoking 100 because of its addictive qualities and it called nicotine which i want to talk about now nicotine is interesting because it stimulates a part of the nervous system that relaxes you it actually causes a stress reduction through your whole body and in fact it can help you breathe a little bit better this is why when people go out and smoke you can just see them calm down they feel like they can finally breathe as they smoke the problem with nicotine it comes with additional package of the extra smoke that right here so ultimately the goal would be to handle the addiction to that at the cellular level the receptors for nicotine have been altered to the point where they so a lot of the effects of feeling calm stress relief are now dependent on this thing right here so unless you continually take in this nicotine your stress level goes up you might get slightly irritable you might get angry you might have depression it can really affect your uh your brain nicotine also stimulates adrenaline and adrenaline is interesting because adrenaline constricts the arteries except for two parts of your body one is in the heart the main artery of the heart is called the coronary nicotine actually opens up and vasodilates that artery so it increases more blood flow to the heart in the lungs it creates a vasodilation effect it opens up the lung tissue so you can breathe better but everywhere else it constricts the arteries so that a very unique thing about adrenaline well nicotine increases adrenaline the problem is it kind of burns out your adrenals so eventually it effect so you need sometimes you need more and more nicotine to create that same effect to the point where you just don enough adrenaline your body to keep your lungs open so unless you taking nicotine to try to kind of stimulate that everything kind of shuts down nicotine also stimulates two other chemicals in your body that greatly affect your mood and your pleasure so sometimes if you don these don your stress level goes up with that as well the best way to handle any type of withdrawal symptoms or any type of addiction is to replace it with something else so there recommend there mormon tea now there used to be this herb called mae hong that was available that you could take for various things uh it was actually really good for the lungs but it created other complications so they banned it from the market but mormon tea has a kind of a mild effect of stimulating adrenaline so it can actually help open up the lungs it but this could potentially act to give you some relief so the need for this can go down also if you take a look at the withdrawal symptoms of nicotine you have increased stress nervous anxiety and grouchiness or anger and things like that vitamin b1 counters that so if you start taking b1 through the day that will minimize the side effects the last thing to realize about nicotine is that in order for the receptors to bounce back and reset to go back to normal it could be between two to six weeks okay the very latest so realize that these withdrawal symptoms are only temporary and if you can just stick it out for two to six weeks it easier to completely handle this addiction right here all right in summary i put all these things to do in the description down below check them out and thanks for watching before you go if you

Vitamin D's Influence Over Your Muscles	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uMUOf_BQo0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	we influence over your muscles when we think of vitamin d deficiency we might think of bone strength calcium absorption anti-inflammatory so if you have osteoporosis for example taking vitamin d can decrease the risk of getting a fracture also vitamin d helps decrease the risk of falling probably more to do with the strength of the muscle but the first symptom that happens when you lower back aches okay low back pain you might get bone pain and also difficulty getting up from aceta position so there controlling neural neuromuscular function but every single muscle cell called the myocyte has a little receptor for vitamin d vitamin d receptor so let vitamin d helps muscle strength whether you stairs or getting up from a seated position or you find that you you just feel weaker could be your vitamin d number two vitamin d helps stabilize your posture so if you find that you slouching too much you may want to look at vitamin d all right number three the proximal muscles uh connected to your hip like the quadricep that that part of your leg the glutes that butt muscle and the iliopsoas is a muscle that connects the lower part of your legs to your upper part of your body so these three large muscle groups are highly influenced with vitamin d so if you in your core it could be a vitamin d deficiency number four your physical performance can be greatly affected by your vitamin d levels and i below to validate all the things that i number five if you vitamin d you could have kind of certain swaying of the body when you waddling back and forth you seen people like that when they walking that be interesting to give that person some vitamin d as a before and after to see how that could change number six the speed or the contractibility of the muscles is influenced by vitamin d so if we a sprinter they should be taking enough vitamin d all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you how to begin keto or you because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Why Red Spots on My Skin Â Dr.Berg on Skin Red Spots Causes & Remedies	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pnzdxEh7vs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so we on the skin i had someone ask the question and there four different underlying causes to this and it can be any type of shape or size but usually it area in the skin and there medical terms for it which i don into i just want to talk about what it could be as an underlying root cause now when you you well so you and and whether it you bruises on your body and that could be the reason you can also be deficient in vitamin c because vitamin c controls capillary strength so if you have a deficiency of vitamin c you to get the red spots are going to look a little bit different they might look like spider veins or little pockets of this red or purple color because you need vitamin c to strengthen the capillaries which are the vascular system just underneath the skin so it could be either vitamin k1 or vitamin c but in nature vitamin k1 and vitamin c usually come together as a complex so if you going to get a mixture of both of them also your gut makes k1 so if you have a history of antibiotics then it could be the reason why you body just is not making it so we have vitamin k1 as a possibility vitamin k1 deficiency vitamin c deficiency but you could also have low amounts of calcium low calcium will also cause the red spots on the skin it it could happen so low calcium could be one cause another cause would be a viral infection okay now there like if you have diabetes or some type of chronic metabolic problem you to see red spots on the lower extremity right behind your lower legs like almost like a large blisters or bruising purple or red that circulation but typically most people have these red spots because they not consuming enough of these right here to get these nutrients or they have some type of malabsorption they their gut has inflammation or it antibiotics or they had gastric bypass or they have a fatty liver which will inhibit the function of vitamin k1 because a lot of the fat cyber vitamins are stored in the liver so if you have gallbladder problems lack a bile you had your gallbladder out you going to have the bile to absorb this fat cyber vitamin and that could be the reason why you have these red spots a gastric bypass could also create a deficiency of both of these because it alters the stomach and the gut now in some circumstances if you add some bile salts to the diet you can find that you get a lot more absorption of all the fat cyber vitamins including k1 so it can help your clotting factors now the foods that are high in k1 kale would be at the top of the list spinach collard greens just dark leafy greens in general and by the way all of these are loaded with vitamin c sauerkraut has the most vitamin c like 700 milligrams per cup bell peppers are loaded with vitamin c other peppers have a lot of vitamin c berries have vitamin c lemons have vitamin c unless it in a container if you get raw lemons and you take the lemon juice then you have vitamin c if you get it in a glass jar it have very low levels of vitamin c all right so that spots on your skin before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you and you need a debug because it going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Irritable Male Syndrome or Just Low Testosterone? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6m7RXd_mGw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let this is primarily for men um but there i put the link down below called efficiency of fasting and calorie restriction on mood and depression among aging men so there was 32 men in this study an average age of 59 and they did this for three months they did a combination of low calorie and also fasting and the results were remarkable there was significant improvement in less tension less anger less confusion that and increase daytime concentration not to mention other benefits like weight loss so there partial endocrine deficiency syndrome it in men as they age where the endocrine system kind of falls apart and the hormones get lower and lower and lower primarily we have two hormones involved we have testosterone and cortisol so we have the spike in cortisol the stress hormone with a drop in testosterone and by the way when you increase cortisol you do drop testosterone so when you have this situation right here which starts to happen at age 50 and it gets worse with time a lot of times men will do testosterone replacement therapy and what they might not realize is that even though it might help them in the short term it will basically stop the production of this hormone in the pituitary called luteinizing hormone and then that will cause atrophy of the gonads because when you body production doesn basically shut down your own production of testosterone so it comes with a package and i don think it solution there are other things that you can do that are very very powerful number one fasting if you and you haven and you you have any of the symptoms with lower testosterone or high cortisol whether it cognitive changes loss of muscle mass lack of sex drive uh ed other issues then fasting can greatly help you and i down below of how to do this correctly zinc is another very important trace mineral that can help enhance testosterone and lower cortisol at the exact same time and number three l-arginine l-arginine is a pretty inexpensive non-essential amino acid that has the ability to increase growth hormone increase testosterone and it also increases something called nitric oxide which can help erectile dysfunction and lower blood pressure and help blood flow to the brain so this one actually is really important in men as they get older and then exercise in general and then of course i know about healthy keto you would want to add that as well then you to pull yourself out of any lower mood situation that you have and help to reverse this right here if you want these benefits right here simply do these things right here before you go if you have a question about a product or you how to begin keto or you because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
A Natural Prednisone or Steroid Protocol	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7H3dZQgNg8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so i wanted to give you an alternative protocol for steroids especially prednisone cortisone anything related to the synthetic version of cortisol like prednisone steroids anti-inflammatories simply because the side effects from this are huge and a lot of people have inflammatory conditions or they might have poison ivy and um what happens as soon as they start taking this let ivory every year or whatever and now over time it works less and less and less to the point where it doesn anymore and so now they and a hard place so i want to give you a natural prednisone alternative so this protocol would be uh to some severe inflammatory reaction whether it poison ivy or whatever what you have to know is that cortisol is made by your adrenal cortex outside of the adrenals you have two adrenals top of the kidney cortisol is the natural anti-inflammatory in the body it suppresses the immune system and this is why when someone is injected with a steroid they feel less pain and less inflammation but it comes with a big package a lot of destruction to that area of the body so for example if you had arthritis in the joint and you got injected over and over and over with steroid eventually you are going to destroy the joint because of the side effects and you healing process so here cortisol you need the cofactor vitamin b5 you need vitamin c and there receptors for vitamin d in the adrenal in other words vitamin d contributes to the enhancement of cortisol and helping it work better so if you have cortisol resistance which is basically a situation where you have cortisol that and then now uh the receptors have downgraded and now it doesn anymore vitamin d can greatly help you kind of reset that so this is the protocol i would recommend for an intense inflammatory reaction let poison ivy for example so let just you over your body what would you do i would recommend taking vitamin b5 500 milligrams vitamin c buffered yes this is synthetic i would get the non-gmo version now 1 000 milligrams i normally do not recommend this but as an anti-inflammatory short-term purpose i would recommend it okay and then vitamin d 10 000 iu i would take this every 15 minutes for two hours just to chill everything out then i would take this combination every two hours for the rest of the day and then after that if needed take this protocol twice a day until things are chilled out so this is just a way of naturally calming things down as you do things to kind of correct it like get yourself on keto intermittent fasting to build up your immune system so i just wanted to give you something as an alternative to this right here especially if this doesn and you hard place and of course just check with your doctor before taking these recommendations thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you know how to begin keto or you debug because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Key Points on Yearly Checkups	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aFi5m4GEm8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so i had a question for someone that wanted to know what tests should i get in my yearly checkup so i just wanted to answer that on this video now of course if you have some pre-existing problem whether the thyroid you have diabetes autoimmune disease you doing like advanced liver testing thyroid testing if you a diabetic you would do an a1c testing you probably already can test yourself at home with your blood glucose levels and if you diabetic i always recommend trying to get this test right here homa ir now one of the problems that happens as soon as you start keto you start improving insulin resistance your insulin drops down and then you go get the test ideally it you start keto and then do an after test and you a dramatic improvement in this test right here homa ir is a test to determine if you have insulin resistance or not you fasting glucose and fasting insulin and there going to do to determine if you have insulin resistance or not but sometimes doc it and they won you want to find a doctor that can do this but if you already started keto and intermittent fasting and you great you don just be a good before and after improvement on that test now as far as getting checkups from your doc routine i they but cbc complete blood count you going to get a basic metabolic panel which is going to look at a lot of different areas of your body they may or may not recommend a vitamin d test i think this is very very important since most people are very very deficient they may not recommend this test i would recommend it if you before it coronary artery calcium scoring very important test way more valuable than a cholesterol test because they going to look into the coronary artery and identify how much calcium you have in there and give you a number based on a scale and so you want it zero some people have over a thousand and that is not good but it know where you because you can always improve it but if it you have to take this very seriously and get on strict keto immediately because you at risk but this is a very important test and let then you can each year just get another one and see how it comes down let keto and you fasting and you you it no because it was normal and you not doing anything to make it worse this test i think is a very important thing to take every year it ratio test but you don to get this test done all you need is a little kit and a drop of blood now the importance of this test is to look at the ratios of omega-3 to omega-6 and the problem is the vast majority of the population are very heavy on the omega-6 these are inflammatory and very low on the omega-3 and so it be really good to know where you so you can start to reverse this and you reverse this by not only taking omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil or olive oil but also by eliminating these other oils which is pretty much in so many foods at the grocery store it just crazy i put a link down below of a lab that you can get this kit to get yourself tested and if you use my code you maximum discount now i am getting zero from this i getting any kickbacks or favors or anything i told the company it i want to pass the maximum savings on to you so it want to get the kid and test yourself the links down below now another point i want to mention if your cholesterol is high this is a very important test to get it lipid test where they size of the particles and they go deeper into the types of lipoproteins that you have and um this will actually give you all the data you need versus just total cholesterol or or your ldl cholesterol or your hdl cholesterol and your triglycerides so i highly recommend doing this if you have high cholesterol or you concerned i the most part personally i don but these are some good points to know about and just to have data as a screening tool to see where you thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you know how to begin keto or you debug because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
What is Ulcerative Colitis? Â Causes, Symptoms & Treatment by Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YH0jYSX7W60	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let very nasty condition where you have inflammation in your colon which is the last part of your digestive tract and the rectum with ulcers with bleeding and the problem is there two solutions medically one is surgery and the other one is steroids so i don because as soon as you do the steroids you might feel better but then the next time you do it you need more and more and more and more until the point where you become resistant to steroids and has a lot of side effects as well and of course surgery is not the ultimate solution because the purpose of the colon is to absorb water and electrolytes so if you and recycle water you dehydrated not to mention the importance of electrolytes as well on the heart also the colon houses most of your microbiome so if you don that flora there to help you make vitamins help your immune system you have a lot of issues and a lot of skin issues as well so i want to give you some other things to do naturally to help if you have ulcerative colitis it condition which means your own immune system is creating a constant irritation and inflammation to the colon creating ulcers so the most important thing if you maybe this is a new thing to you if you what you need to do fasting fasting is the most important thing when you eat six meals a day this is very very bad for ulcerative colitis because you never give it a chance to heal so fasting will drop inflammation it will increase the diversity of your microbiome okay which is interesting you not feed these microbes but then they become more diverse they become stronger they survive better if you feed them too much they get lazy and fat also you something called small chain fatty acids and this is an anti-inflammatory compound and it helps with insulin resistance it helps with your immune system so fasting is very very important if you down below of how to do intermittent fasting and periodic prolonged fasting number two zinc zinc is necessary for any type of ulcers so if you have a zinc deficiency you it increases your risk of getting an ulcer so you want zinc number three vitamin d and i know you many many times in fact i had one comment today on one of my youtube videos that said dr berg do you recommend fasting vitamin d for every single condition and i said just about simply because it and if the condition involves inflammation which is a large percentage of conditions then these two things are are necessary so vitamin d in higher amounts i talking about 40 000 ius per day maybe even more for ulcerative colitis vitamin d is an immune modulator it controls the immune system it helps to put the fire out it very powerful anti-inflammatory and it acts like cortisone protozoan but without the side effects so this is very very important cabbage juice has some interesting research i put a link down below for all the research that i talking about right now cabbage juice certain phytonutrients in cabbage juice has known properties to help with ulcers and gastritis and any type of damage in your colon especially inflammation in fact if you have ulcerative colitis or celiac or some type of inflammation in your gut cabbage as a vegetable seems to be something you probably will be able to digest more than other vegetables um but for a great majority of people consuming vegetables will irritate their colon so in that case they have to go more carnivore for a while maybe two months maybe longer to help reset and heal the colon because the fiber acts to irritate the colon but they might do fine with cabbage but the cabbage juice is something you can actually take so you want to juice it fresh all right number five vsl number three this is a very uh powerful probiotic you can get it from the health food store you can get it online there take four to eight capsules not right away you take a very small amount initially and gradually work up to it because it can create an immune reaction but it has a count of 900 billion compared to other probiotics which at the very most it so there it to take it for at least a month two months to really start seeing the change because it slow process it powerful for ulcerative colitis in any type of inflammatory condition wheatgrass juice powder has also some interesting studies that i put down below to help with any type of lesions inflammation ulcers on the internal part of your skin the lining either in the esophagus the stomach the small intestine the large intestine or apple cider vinegar wheatgrass juice and wheatgrass juice powder is very beneficial to help the inner skin of the gut so i think really if you did these things right here you there these items right here so give it a shot and comment down below before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you keto and you need a debug because it not going

Best Foods for Dry Eyes (Vitamin A Deficiency Symptoms) Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAmTpz6JUdA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let the glands that produce tears in the little ducks that the tears drain through are controlled by vitamin a so vitamin a has everything to do with controlling what those cells that line the inside of the gland and also the inside of the body like the little ducts and also other tissue that line the inside of your body so if there inner lining of the ducts as well as the gland kidney form it can get thicker the tissue can get rougher and the actual production of the tear or fluids diminish so an average person who has dry eyes not knowing this will tend to get the drops in the eyes and hopefully they won steroid drops because that creates all sorts of side effects so the three top vitamin a symptoms would be number one dry eyes night blindness you can actually go blind there quite a high percentage of children in certain countries that are vitamin a deficient when they so there vitamin a and your vision and then blurred vision now vitamin a does a lot of other things too related to your immune system your mucous membranes but for what we eyes is definitely a vitamin a deficiency now i don a vitamin a for this simply because a lot of the vitamin a out there is synthetic and that comes with the package there but here are the foods that are very high in vitamin a the top one is cod liver oil you can also get cod liver in a can it good i put a link down below liver has a lot of vitamin a fatty fish has a good amount of vitamin a butter and ghee have vitamin a cheese has vitamin a especially if it fatty or cheese egg yolks are loaded with vitamin a and beef has vitamin a now unfortunately the actual definition of vitamin a also includes pre-vitamin a beta-carotene and some other carotenoids this is not actually vitamin a even though it because it has to be converted into the active form of vitamin a which is retinol so when you buy food and you look at the back of the label and it says has this much vitamin a don talking about the precursor now what is the significance of that well the conversion to the active form of vitamin a is not that great in other words it takes 20 molecules of the precursor to convert into one molecule of the active form of vitamin a not only that 50 percent of the population has a genetic variant it polymorphism which prevents this conversion to a certain degree so don the precursors now beta-carotene and other carotenoids which are phytonutrients have great benefits other great benefits their antioxidants they do a lot but they as retinol so if you and you it may not work retinol is only in animal products so if you vegan in your dry eyes this could be the reason you converting to the active form of retinol now there say you here and you still have dry eyes well it could be you have inflammation in the gut because you had a history of antibiotics it could be because you have some problem with your liver fatty liver or your gallbladder or you had your gallbladder removed and you deficient in bile or you have sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth which robs certain nutrients the way you would know that is every time you eat you feel extremely bloated especially with fiber and vegetables and i already mentioned fatty liver but it could also be an inflamed liver so anything wrong with the liver can impair the ability to absorb vitamin a and vitamin a is stored in the liver but as it starts to fill up with fat you lose the ability to store vitamin a and other fat soluble vitamins all right i think i covered everything i wanted to cover thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you debug because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Abdominal Pain Radiating to the Back: Deeper Causes Of Chronic Pancreatitis Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUNchi5L_ws	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let radiates to your back now you have several situations you have abdominal pain that the right side or the left side or the center that can refer right into the back through here or it can come up through the left upper back here or the right upper back through here so if it usually that liver because there in the gallbladder the bile duct or the liver and it could be a gallstone it could be sludge in here could be something that obstructing the flow that hitting a little nerve right underneath your diaphragm that called the phrenic nerve that goes all the way to your neck so if you press right here you here and it can actually go up into the head through here it could be a headache it can actually cause a spasm on the right part of your neck and your trap and literally pull that vertebra to the right and pinch the nerve and that can refer down to the right arm and also when people are diagnosed with fibromyalgia it really a problem with the gallbladder but if you have pain in the center right through in here or to the left side that could be the pancreas because the pancreas extends beyond the center sometimes all the way over here and that potentially could be something called pancreatitis now the most common symptoms of pancreatitis is upper abdominal pain we right in the center right over your stomach area right here the second one would be upper abdominal pain that radiates okay it could radiate around here or come up through here third one is upper abdominal pain that worse after you eat because you nausea tenderness bloating but you could also have nausea tendonous bloating burping belching if you have a problem over here as well now a couple main causes of pancreatitis which is inflammation of the pancreas is alcohol gallstones or high calcium high calcium is not very common alcohol could be common but stones having gallstones is a really big cause but those gallstones could be lodged not necessarily even over here in the gallbladder but right in the pancreatic area right through in here there certain ducts that drain through here and if you obstruct that it and distend and cause pain and bloating and pressure now there of pancreatitis which occurs 30 of the time and that is called idiopathic they call it idiopathic pancreatitis what does that mean it means unknown cause so they don causes it but i found an interesting article that is talking about the cause of idiopathic pancreatitis the actual cause of unknown cause pancreatitis which is very interesting and they mentioned that 79 of the cause of the idiopathic pancreatitis is something called bilirary lithiasis or bile sludge now what does that mean this word means a very very small gallstone that is not detected on ultrasound or a cat scan you would have to stick a scope in the bile duct and look with a certain machine to pick this up or it could be found when you a stone that okay so it gallstone and what happens when these stones start to crystallize they have calcium crystals they can form sludge and obstruct these ducts but it sometimes all you have is nothing that shows up on a test other than a patient with bloating that pain that might radiate to the back area so if we combine the percentage of this with this we can see that gallstones or gall sludge is a big factor with pancreatitis not to mention with pain that goes to the right side as well through this area right here so what is the solution well you first have to understand what causes a gallstone or bile sludge what causes it is a super concentration of cholesterol and the mechanism of that is this if you don to emulsify and break up that cholesterol and keep it thinned it can actually form into a stone so in reality a stone a small stone bile sludge is caused by a deficiency of bile and this is why one of the big treatments that you would get for a stone or bile sludge would be oral purified bile salts so you would take that as a supplement and that would help to thin the bile break up the stones and relieve the pressure this is also very good for another condition called the sphincter of adi syndrome and really what that is is that when the bile ducts and the pancreatic duct joins inside the small intestine there a little duct right here so if there right here it pressure they call that the sphincter body syndrome really it either a stone or sludge that obstructing this duct which is a little tube creating a lot of pain now not only would you want to recommend purify bile salts but you want to also make sure that you correct the cause of a bile deficiency and here some causes low-fat diet because fat triggers the release of bile so if you cut the fat down in the diet you don release the bile as well a high carb diet especially if you fructose or refined carbohydrates can also deplete your bile reserve this is why a diabetic has a higher risk of getting gallstones because of the high amount of blood sugars they have if you have a decreased microbiome let a series of antibiotics that destroyed your good bacteria you might have a deficiency in bile because your microbes also make bile so you have the liver that makes bile and your microbes so if you have liver damage that can be one source of a bile deficiency or if you don that can be another source and this leads to the next thing a fatty liver can inhibit the production of bile high amounts of estrogen as in pregnancy can alter the production of bile and limit it also high cortisol can inhibit the production of bile this comes from stress it could also come from taking prednisone which is a steroid which is usually for like a type of arthritis or an autoimmune disease now the best diet to prevent this in the first place is healthy keto i to my channel and especially intermittent fasting because if you can actually not eat so frequently and let your system reset and let the bowel concentrate by not eating so frequently you can greatly help to avoid this problem the first place i put a link down below for those of you that are new to my channel thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you keto and you need a

Vitamin E Inhibits Scar Tissue Â Benefits of Vitamin E for Fibrosis Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpjE4gJQ2e4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so check this out vitamin e has the ability to inhibit fibrosis now let me just kind of make this more real to you you can have fibrosis in the lung as scar tissue from all sorts of problems along whether it scar tissue in the lung which is copd or maybe you had a series of lung infections which created scar tissue you could also have like rheumatoid arthritis that can develop scar tissue in the joints the actual heart tissue called the myocardium can develop scar tissue and inhibit function the arteries can fill up with scar tissue making the arteries very very stiff raising blood pressure setting you up for arterial sclerosis also if those arteries go in the brain it can predispose you to even getting a stroke then you have the amyloid plaque in the brain which is a protein which is a type of scar which is involved with alzheimer the liver once the liver becomes fatty and then inflamed that can turn into scar tissue or fibrosis so fibrosis or scar tissue is pathological wound healing there replacing functional tissue so now the function of that tissue doesn replaced by scar tissue tocotrienols is what i would recommend which is a certain type of vitamin e it tocopherols it 50 to 90 times stronger and the reason for that is that tocotrienols inhibit the collateral damage from white blood cells trying to heal the area now in past videos i talked about the immune system having a function of defending against pathogens microbes viruses right i the immune system killing cancer cells and shrinking tumors but the immune system has a third function and it very intimately in wound healing anytime you have inflammation and wound healing you have the immune system you have the white blood cells and it radicals the oxidation that your own immune system that excessive damage in scar tissue so when the white blood cells are releasing massive amounts of cytokines which are inflammatory and it sorts of collateral damage then you get scar tissue so toe katrina can neutralize those free radicals it can counter that effect it can inhibit fibrosis so if you have an inflammatory condition i would highly recommend take this before it turns into the scar tissue or fibrosis because the problem is once it becomes to a certain level it reverse it now the dosage i would recommend per day would be at least 300 milligrams if you have a lot inflammation you can take more or maybe you could take this three times a day i don taking the tocotrienols with the tocopherols okay because sometimes the tocopherols can slow down the effectiveness of the tocotrienols all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you keto and you need a debug because it not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
What Does Pale-Colored Poop Mean? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHH6B1ZqsLU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys today i have a topic that is probably not very popular because no one wants to talk about it but we pale colored stool i mean someone needs to talk about it mice will be me right all right so what is it well before i get into what is it i a little background of how you would develop that problem okay so to understand that we have to kind of go through a little bit about chemistry i really really brief and simple there is a chain reaction in the body that occurs when your blood cells break down so if your red blood cells are getting older or they recycle them so the hemoglobin which carries the oxygen which is the protein part splits off so the iron goes this way which is red and the heme goes another pathway to the liver and so the hemoglobin turns in the heme then it turns into something called biliverdin okay biliverdin which is a green colored it pigment it because the bile helps excrete it from the liver into the small intestine where it can be eliminated so we have heme then we have billy burden which is green and then we have a substance called bilirubin and that is yellow kind of orangish yellow and that is what makes your urine yellow and it up into the liver into the skin it your skin yellow or your eyes yellow as jaundice so i in the small intestine some of that bilirubin which is yellow gets absorbed into the intestine into your blood turns into urine that have bacteria that act on bilirubin they help oxidize it and they turn it brown so your stool normally should be brown from the bacterial oxidation of bilirubin so that you need to know now what happens and this is a very common problem is if the hemoglobin breakdown chain reaction doesn liver to the small intestine and it gets kind of stuck or blocked because someone has a gallstone or some sludge through these little ducts they called bile ducts and the medical name for that is coleostasis where the bile is not moving properly let test and you have high levels of bilirubin right but you also have dark colored urine you have pale colored stool could be like gray colored what so we getting absence of this pigment in the stool and that kind of a chalky color so we don in the stool so it or clay colored that usually means you have some blockage in the bile ducts or it could mean your liver is not producing bile because it so one good symptom to tell you if you have a blockage between the liver and the small intestine and primarily the bile ducts is light-colored stool dark urine um a little bit of jaundice could be one of the symptoms as well as itchiness which is the bile being backed up into the skin and bile is very very very beneficial to your body but not if it never want bile to be kind of stuck in the liver because it we inflammation now the simple solution to all this is simply to take purify bile salts because because if it more of a super concentrated cholesterol situation cholesterol crystals and it that helps to break that up so taking more bile and empty stomach maybe twice a day will help to open up the flows from the liver to the small intestine and restore the the problem but there a deeper problem and that usually has to do with the person if you not familiar with what to eat i put a link down below check it out because you need to be on something called healthy keto and intermittent fasting to really get rid of the deeper root cause that thing in the first place all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you how to begin keto or you because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Is High Doses of Potassium Toxic? - OKAY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhHSF_tuxdY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	welcome back for another video today we toxicity is it dangerous to take high levels of potassium and why is it when you go buy a potassium product most of them are roughly about 99 milligrams per tablet isn especially since our body requirement is 4700 milligrams a day so let interesting um article research article i want to put a link down below that was an opinion of a scientific panel on dietetic products nutrition and allergens they tolerable upper intake amounts of potassium and this was written the 22nd of february 2005 and this is what the summary was long-term intake of three grams that of potassium per day of potassium chloride supplements in addition to the intake of potassium you get from your food has been shown not to cause adverse effects like elevated potassium that hyperkalemia or gastrointestinal symptoms in healthy individuals now there were a few reports in other publications of potassium causing gastrointestinal discomfort and small bowel lesions but what you need to know is they didn use potassium citrate they use potassium chloride in a certain form called entire coated tablets that gives a delayed effect so it like you reabsorbed pretty quickly it pretty much slows down the absorption and it sits in certain parts of your intestine and your body takes a while for it to break it down now if you look up data about anterior coated anything you they use are shellac which is like a glossy varnish with chemicals certain plastics certain organic solvents synthetic polymers which is from petroleum and i put an interesting link down below that talks about entire aspirin and the results of that study show that when certain groups of people take entire coded aspirin it increases the risk of gastrointestinal complications and small intestinal mucosal injury so was the problem coming from potassium or was it coming from the interior coating that is the big question now to my knowledge there is no studies that i could find on potassium citrate even in higher amounts creating any type of toxicity at all your body has a unique way of getting rid of excess potassium if it doesn reasons why someone should not be taking large amounts of potassium number one if they have end stage renal failure okay or if they have chronic kidney problems another contraindication would be if they inhibitor for high blood pressure because that inhibits the ability to get rid of potassium and lastly if someone has addison autoimmune disease of the adrenal the person cannot hold on to sodium so they and then the potassium is going to go high because sodium potassium works together so in summary if you one to three thousand milligrams in potassium in addition to the potassium that you get from your diet and you any problem with doing that especially since you need a lot of potassium most people are deficient in potassium and your body has a very unique mechanism of not holding on excessive amounts of potassium	Success
Hysterectomy and Your Body Shape	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1aWLZ-byC0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	i want to talk about how hysterectomy can really destroy your body shape now this video is not just for women who had a hysterectomy but it considering a hysterectomy you might want to think twice because here there ligaments that are attached to the inside of your torso to the bottom part of the ribs to the lower back to the pelvis and when they cut these ligaments and fascia which is a ligament it can create an imbalance because all these ligaments are opposing your abdominal muscles so when you lose this stabilizing base it can create major weaknesses within your abdominal muscles and then your stomach starts to collapse and fall forward giving you more of a belly fat it can also create lower back pain because you lose the low back curvature it can even actually spread your hips out a little bit more it can create weaknesses in your core but other than that i think it very sarcastic there effects too that occur after you have a hysterectomy number one you can lose your libido you can have bladder issues bowel issues even increase your risk for cardiovascular disease and even clots because the imbalance in hormones if you had a full hysterectomy when they took out the ovaries as well depression is a side effect weight gain is a big side effects in fact the average a woman who gets a hysterectomy after one year is weighing 25 pounds more also you can have pain and inflammation but there are also people that have no symptoms at all so before you implement any of this information check with your doctor i top reasons and there why someone would get a hysterectomy would be endometriosis and fibroids usually both of those conditions occur because you and that means that you would want to avoid estrogen like birth control pills also avoid gmo cotton did you realize that cotton is gmo which means it has exposure to glyphosate herb which could mimic estrogen and create problems so make sure your tampons were organic and also dairy i if you do dairy it must be organic but if you are estrogen dominant i would avoid dairy completely and other things you need to avoid of course is soy and pretty much all of your foods should be organic including your vegetables because pesticides insecticides herbicides fungicides that are on your food can mimic estrogen so we reverse that now there balance your estrogen and give you more good estrogen versus bad estrogen one is consuming more cruciferous vegetables and two consuming seek help if you to take a sea kelp tablet i always recommend only taking one per day you don but a little bit can be very very helpful now if you hysterectomy i hope you keto i hope you both of those together are going to be essential in supporting reduction of inflammation as well as leveraging your metabolism to give you the best chance of losing weight so you can minimize the excess weight around your midsection and if you do fasting periodic prolonged fasting your body will go through what and will help recycle damaged proteins as in scar tissue and adhesions that comes with surgery and the last thing i would recommend if you do have adhesions or scar tissue which causes pain is tocatrinals it type of vitamin e that works very well on reducing inflammation turning into fibroid adhesions thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you keto and you need a debug because it not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
B1 Deficiency After Antibiotics	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TakMkQvo5qQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey i deficiency now i all the videos talking about b1 thymine related to a lot of different things this one is about b1 deficiency after you take antibiotics now before i begin i zoom with a mic that makes me sound like i have a cold which i don the camera makes my nose look bigger and my head bigger and my body no i didn camera and a new mic for the location that i in okay so let antibiotics now there antibiotics that can create a b1 deficiency cipro i listed a bunch of other ones the penicillins the sulfa antibiotics and there a few others in fact there over 60 generic versions also in this list now what you have to realize is vitamin b1 comes from your diet but it also comes from your microbes and as you kill them off with taking an antibiotic you can end up with a b1 deficiency and other deficiencies as well here are some of the symptoms atd anxiety agitation nervousness lack of memory in some cases severe hypoglycemia even to the point where you can actually go into a coma tendinitis and check this out tendon rupture now why in the heck would someone get a tendon rupture after taking an antibiotic and what the relationship to vitamin b1 well vitamin b1 doesn metabolism it deals with amino acid metabolism as well and if you going to be able to transport certain branch amino acids to make your collagen so it can set you up with all sorts of weaknesses within the collagen formation there enhanced warning disabling and potentially permanent side effects involving tendons muscles joints and nerves and this is displayed on the paperwork when they give you this antibiotic also it can create irreversible peripheral neuropathy so if you have to take an antibiotic i would highly recommend you not only take a probiotic at the same time but also take your b vitamins in the form of nutritional yeast so this video is just about increasing your awareness on another reason why you might end up with a b1 deficiency before you go if you have a question about a product or you know how to begin keto or you because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help you	Success
The Non-Stress Cause of Adrenal Fatigue Symptoms Â Vitamin B1/Thiamine Deficiency Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoAGKwEhU5I	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you probably have seen my other videos on stress and adrenal fatigue i few in this video i about the non-stress cause of adrenal fatigue now so many people are stressed out and they but some people have adrenal fatigue and they really haven and they with an adrenal issue with no stress so there of this but before i get into that let me just tell you what the adrenal gland does the adrenal gland has two parts an outside and an inside the inside is all neurological tissue it makes neurotransmitters it the adrenal medulla the outside is all glandular and that makes hormones like cortisol and a few others now the adrenal medulla is primarily part of the autonomic nervous system specifically the sympathetic nervous system which is the flight or fight you have the opposing system called the parasympathetic and that is located in your brain stem it but for this video we focus in on the adrenals and also the brain stem so the parasympathetic nervous system which is located in the brain stem kind of counteracts the sympathetic flutter fight mode so it rest digest and recovery so if you experience stress you can activate the adrenals and eventually wear out the adrenals but what about if you lose the parasympathetic control what happens then like you lose your brake pads and from a non-stress source well that can actually create a sympathetic dominant problem where you and you have all the symptoms and so the brain stem is very sensitive to thymine b1 deficiencies so when you in b1 you can have all sorts of problems with the brain stem specifically a lack of adaptation to stress because the autonomic nervous system then starts becoming dysfunctional so one real simple way that you know that that system is involved is if you stand up too quickly and you get dizzy or you might pass out there severe condition called pots which also falls in this category but so many people get up from a seated position or they get up too quick and they and that could be an electrolyte problem where you but it can also be a b1 deficiency because the brain stem needs b1 to work correctly being b1 deficient can create a lack of adaptation to gravity stress and it can affect your ability to tolerate stress in general so it physical stress it could be about adapting to mental stress as well as you may already know a b1 deficiency can create anxiety and fatigue very similar to having just an adrenal gland that and having high levels of cortisol so it the problem with vitamin b1 it soluble and it doesn long i mean you could be completely depleted within 18 days of not consuming vitamin b1 however it not just about not consuming b1 it directly create a deficiency the biggest thing is refine carbohydrates whether it create a huge problem and also the more carbohydrate you consume the more the demand for b1 so if you consume a lot of carbs you able to metabolize those carbohydrates also alcohol is a big b1 depleter coffee can create a b1 deficiency so those jittery feelings that you might feel if you drink too much coffee if you took b1 boom goes away t with its tannic acid can create a b1 deficiency sulfites which are in wine so we combine the alcohol and the sulphites can deplete your b1 antibiotics i can create a b1 deficiency diuretics can create a b1 deficiency metformin the drug for diabetes can also create a b1 deficiency so in summary the symptoms of adrenal fatigue are very very very similar if not identical to the symptoms of a b1 deficiency before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help you	Success

The 7 Causes of Shortness of Breath Â Dr.Berg on Breathing Problems	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWOqHX04xFY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so let things that can cause shortness of breath okay that condition where you just can well now there that people already know like if you have liver disease kidney disease chronic lung disease asthma things like that but what i want to focus on are all the other reasons where this symptom would come from other than the obvious ones number one a vitamin b1 deficiency so many people have a b1 deficiency it it and a major deficiency of vitamin b1 is called berry berry and there berry berry involving the vascular system and the blood in the heart and there the nervous system so you can have symptoms in the nervous system as well as in your heart but there something called a subclinical beriberi which is i think very very common simply because the amount of refined carbohydrates and sugars that people eat and i i recently did a video on b1 on all the other reasons why you might be deficient taking an antibiotic drinking too much coffee or tea or alcohol or sulfates and i below but if you have edema and definitely problems breathing because the heart is not able to pump out blood effectively there condition that occurs when you called lactic acidosis that starts to accumulate lactate and then your ph drops and you become too acidic you holding on too much of co2 and that ability to get oxygen and you to have hard times breathing now there reasons why someone might have lactic acidosis number one it take metformin lactic acidosis is a symptom of diabetes if you can also have lactic acidosis if you have liver problems or kidney problems you can develop that condition if you overdo it on exercise you can also develop lactic acidosis if you also drink a lot of alcohol you can develop lactic acidosis vitamin b1 is the remedy for lactic acidosis as well as shortness of breath if you have that condition now your ph can really affect how you breathe if you you have acidosis you could have labored deep breathing or something called air hunger where you just can enough oxygen and then if you alkalosis you can also have breathing problems as well as well as muscle issues like cramping tetany where you got these little twitching things in your muscles muscle cramps in your lower legs because the minerals like calcium can mobilized in the body and high levels of cortisol and stress can cause you to become too alkaline being on a high carb diet can cause severe alkalosis and a potassium deficiency can also cause alkalosis as well as consuming too much calcium if you have too much calcium in your blood your ph is going to become more alkaline because calcium is more alkaline so just by the symptom of shortness of breath you can really tell if you too acid you symptoms that are associated with either ph problem i did put a video down below if you want more information on that topic now if you blood you can also have difficulty in breathing as well and of course if you have asthma you have difficulty breathing too and by the way vitamin d is really important in helping you breathe if you have asthma pneumonia you zinc is the remedy for that and then copd i did a more extensive video on copd that involves a chronic lung inflammatory condition vitamin c is vital as well as vitamin e in reducing inflammation and inhibiting the formation of fibrosis in your lung all right guys there the potential causes of shortness of breath before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you keto and you need a debug because it not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Always Use Zinc for Diarrhea Â Zinc Deficiency & Diarrhea Remedy Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEf9T73iRZw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	did you realize that over 500 000 children under the age of 5 die of diarrhea every single year that completely blows my mind now this actually is coming from a zinc deficiency so there are deficient in zinc number one they don their diet most of the zinc in the diet comes from animal products meat organ meats as well as shellfish and seafood so if you or you vegan you could be deficient in zinc now the other reason why people and children are deficient in zinc is this they that are high in something called phytates or phytic acid which is in the fiber part of grains so phytates block the absorption of zinc and you deficiency now our bodies need zinc for many many things but there are three main purposes of zinc in relationship to preventing diarrhea number one zinc restores the mucosal barrier integrity of your intestines so if that gut barrier is broken down you have what translocation of bacteria into your body so when you don certain microbes can cross through this immune barrier and create all sorts of immune reactions which then your body is going to defend that with diarrhea number two zinc is intimately involved in the enzyme reactions within your small intestine the lining of your small intestine actually makes enzymes and you need zinc to make those enzymes to help you digest so if you the enzyme activity things don diarrhea and number three zinc is really needed for your antibodies to fight off pathogens so that defenses for these pathogens go down and then you have this immune reaction so the bottom line is if you deficient in zinc your risk for diarrhea goes up and you have a lot of digestive issues so if you have chronic diarrhea whether you you need to be taking zinc now there some other things that you can take as well bentonite clay is another good remedy for diarrhea and in some other videos i recommend kefir unsweetened of course whole fat and blackberries blended together sometimes that can help as well but if you not a good option you may be able to find some lactose free kefir but your problem could also be an allergy to the casein in the dairy so you avoid that however zinc is probably one of the most important things to take if you have diarrhea now the other problem with diarrhea is that when you have diarrhea you lose your electrolytes and your trace minerals so it about taking zinc back into the body it taking all the trace minerals and the electrolytes as well all right thank you for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you how to begin keto or you because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
7 Unusual Vitamin B1 Deficiency Symptoms	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjvPC1ayCWk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today i want to talk about seven very odd or weird b1 deficiency symptoms i probably one of the most important vitamins if you you anxious you you some real interesting additional symptoms that you need to be aware of that first one is reynod syndrome what is raynaud that fingertips turn literally blue when you actually get exposed to cold so what if you don autonomic nervous system does not work right it doesn adapt to stress gravity stress and even temperature stress so the venous blood tends to accumulate in the ends of your fingertips when you have this condition so it number two morning sickness that would be the feeling of nauseousness or you want to even vomit that there sub symptom of morning sickness which is a hypersensitivity to certain types of odors so if a woman is pregnant and she just cannot stand to be in a certain room because of a certain odor because it b1 deficiency as well next one is increased pulse rate or heart rate that is a b1 deficiency and then you have edema swelling in the ankles a lot of times people associate that with sodium retention or fluid retention but it could be a b1 deficiency because when you get a b1 deficiency you have what and there involves a cardiovascular system in dry berry berry which involves the nervous system this one is under the category of a wet berry berry which is a cardiovascular problem which you number five psychosis could be a b1 deficiency now this person who is psychotic ha is completely disconnected from reality they they reasonable and i into anyone like that all right next one number six shortness of breath your breathing air hunger especially at night is a b1 deficiency and last one is you position or when you to standing up if you stand up and you feel disoriented or dizzy that deficiency has everything to do with the failure to adapting to stress gravity you name it so if you have any of these odd symptoms you need to be taking nutritional yeast for more information about b1 i put some links down below check them out before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you and you need a debug because it going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
The 3rd Purpose of Your Immune System	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMjpK_Iel0w	Dr. Eric Berg DC	did you realize that there function of your immune system well that today the immune system helps you fight pathogens it also helps you kill cancer in tumor cells but it involved in a third function and that would be wound healing now this goes beyond inflammation and there that you have called macrophages and a macrophage means big cell that eats and it first lines of defense against uh infections to comply so it that waits for some pathogen to invade the body and then it will just go after and heat it up there neutrophils now the neutrophils are really like the main front line of defense and then you have the macrophage that actually will back them up but they both tend to work together now when you have acute inflammation like let infection that would be the neutrophils that jump in there and do their job but when we get into chronic inflammation then we the macrophages because even the macrophages will eat up the dead neutrophils and they type inflammatory condition so any condition that has an itis at the end of it like bursitis tendinitis arthritis iliitis and the list goes on and on and on the macrophage is involved with that so there that involve inflammation which basically brings the blood and brings other things to the area for healing so what happens when you have inflammation in various organs whether it the kidneys the tendon the muscles the arteries or the colon that inflammation can then turn into scar tissue so you have two different things you have the normal healing cycle then you have something called pathogenic inflammation or pathogenic wound healing and now you have this tissue that that doesn and it becomes dysfunctional and the more of that tissue you have the more chronic inflammation you going to have and the more free radical damage you going to have and then you to have a lack of function in that area so the macrophage is involved with wound healing whether it pathogenic every time you work out at the gym and you damage your muscles the macrophage will come in there and help repair the muscle it brings in certain growth factors for regeneration and the macrophage which is a white blood cell actually will eat up the damaged tissue and it will also bring in growth factors and fibrin which actually forms the scar tissue matrix and it stimulated with hypoxia or lack of oxygen so that macrophages what is the significance of this how am i going to use this information well the same nutrition that supports the white blood cells for immune protection is the same nutrition that you would use to support wound healing so let me give you an example ulcers the remedy for that would be zinc because zinc will stimulate the macrophages to help heal ulcers okay so that would be one example another example would be vitamin d vitamin d is essential for your immune system to prevent excessive amounts of over reaction or inflammation so if you have some type of condition where you have chronic inflammation whether it system or the joints or wherever so you support that macrophage all right here do there from inflammation to scar tissue and it just so happens that tocotrinols which is a very specific type of vitamin e will slow down that process and really what it it macrophage in slowing down the release of that fibrous scar tissue so it basically stops these immune cells from producing too much excessive amounts of scar tissue now that could be in the lung that can be in your liver that can be in your arteries that can be in the colon that can actually be high levels of iron because you have too much you too much iron it could be an infection some type of microbe that much calcium in your body in which case you would need vitamin k2 to extract it or it could be too much glucose glucose or sugar actually depletes antioxidants and it destroys the vascular system to different tissues it lot of free radical damage so of course what i the keto diet if you one and then the last thing that really creates a lot of inflammatory condition would be omega-6 fatty acids the soy oil the canola oil the corn oils all the vegetable oils create a lot of oxidation which then creates a lot of damage and what you inside the arteries inside the liver inside your tendons and the macrophages come in there and try to heal it but if you don of the trigger or provide the right nutrients it develops into this excessive chronic inflammatory scar tissue situation where your body just can tocotrinols zinc vitamin d are essential but also fasting so fasting is very very powerful to not only slow down inflammation but to help stimulate your macrophages into cleaning up all the damaged proteins that have developed from the scar tissue all right guys thanks for watching and if you haven immune system i put a link down below check it out before you go if you have a question about a product or you know

WhatÂs at the Root of an Autoimmune Condition	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukN0yp-d1yM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	if you have an autoimmune condition you need to know this information in this video i other videos on this topic but you may have not seen them so i want to do another one specifically on this one point so more and more people can understand the mechanism behind autoimmune diseases and an autoimmune condition is a condition where your body has developed antibodies against itself so it a lot of unknowns about autoimmune conditions but there that they know based on a lot of research and all the data that i talk about is going to be in links down below and you should definitely research this yourself there stands for t helper 17 cell this is part of your immune system it real interesting things which we into but this is what they know about autoimmune conditions an autoimmune condition is an over activation of the th17 cell okay so if that cell is dysregulated and it you arthritis ms lupus psoriasis and even asthma now asthma typically is not classified as an autoimmune condition but there some data that says that it is an autoimmune condition so it allergies in general even though allergies are not an immune condition involve the t helper 17 cell and as a side note hiv involves having an under activation of the t helper 17 cell in fact part of the immune system specifically the t helper cells which regulate the entire immune system is pretty much dysfunctional in hiv so the problem in autoimmune conditions the real problem is the chronic inflammation that collateral damage and it system so the th17 cell modulates and prevents autoimmune diseases and so if you have an over activation you a problem with autoimmune diseases now vitamin d is a direct inhibitor of the th17 cell and also they use it as treatment for th17 mediated diseases so vitamin d in high doses i about at least 40 000 ius are essential in autoimmune diseases also there going to put a link down below that involves with using natural things for decreasing the inflammatory pathways like curcumin small chain fatty acids that microbes make those fatty acids and also sulforaphane in cruciferous vegetables all very good for inflammation and then the fasting mimicking diet there hasn fasting which i would highly recommend for this these conditions but there is some great data on the fasting mimicking diet which you you calories so vitamin d these natural remedies are all very very important if you have an autoimmune condition look up the t helper 17 cell in relationship to vitamin d and some of these other natural remedies and i think that can really help you before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you and you need a debug because it going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Raynauds Syndrome Â What Can you do for Raynaud's Syndrome Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC5kKTe1eWI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so let what is it it fingertips turn literally blue or purple usually after exposure to cold because cold is a trigger stress can trigger it but what happening you your arteries and your blood flow and you this pool of venous blood and it can last for minutes to hours okay and the treatment is usually avoid cold and or give you some type of medication that involves influencing your sympathetic nervous system which is part of the autonomic nervous system which gives us a clue on where the problem might be this problem really comes from a failure of your autonomic nervous system to adapt to cold and the risk factors could be having a history of frostbite women in their 20s and 40s and having estrogen dominance so estrogen can trigger this condition now there reynodds which is idiopathic which means unknown cause or it occurred spontaneously okay or it could be secondary and that comes from a connective tissue disorder like lupus or some type of autoimmune condition what do you do about it what can you take to resolve this vitamin b1 has shown some remarkable improvements in reducing symptoms from raynaud going to put the link down below but and vitamin b1 also helps women balance estrogen so if you have estrogen dominance vitamin b1 can help so maybe that it works but there because vitamin b1 helps support the autonomic nervous system and this problem is usually a problem with the autonomic nervous system so b1 can greatly help there that i it which is a combination of vitamin b3 and inositol and it just so happens that this condition helps improve vein circulation which is affected by cold so those are the two remedies that i for raynauds before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you and you need a debug because it going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Causes of High Creatinine Levels in Blood Â Dr.Berg on Elevated Creatinine Levels	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUn3_n7Y4Ns	Dr. Eric Berg DC	i mean if you have high creatinine in your blood okay so i show you all the reasons why this could be now there that converts to creatinine which is a waste product that to be through the urine but when it that means there potentially could be a kidney problem but there reasons as well but creatine in general helps recycle atp which is an energy currency in your muscles and your brain it involved in muscle metabolism also a lot of people take it for exercise performance so when you have high levels of creatinine in your blood but it number one kidney damage okay it could also be you there create this effect i didn those i wanted to talk about the most common reasons now intense exercise because you breaking down muscle you may have high creatine in your blood it doesn there means you breaking down that compound now the more muscle mass that you have the more creatinine you as well now this next thing is probably more relatable to more people that are doing keto a lot of times they too much protein but dietary meat especially if it it could potentially create high levels of creatinine in your blood simply because when you heat the meat it converts creatine to creatinine okay it non-pathogenic it just might want to lower the amount of meat that you eat then you have creatine supplements if you taking this for performance or you bodybuilder or whatever if you up in the blood too it you might want to just lower the amounts all right there you have it the six reasons why you may have higher levels of creatinine in your blood before you go if you have a question about a product or you know how to begin keto or you debug because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help you	Success
Right-Sided Trap Tightness: An Easy Fix	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7mwonjsCuI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so i want to talk about a very common problem with most people and it involves uh tight muscles tight traps specifically on the right side up here so many people when they go to massage therapists they get their shoulders massaged and it the right side because it is so easy to fix it unnecessary and the problem is not what you think so let look at what on the back okay there neck called cervical vertebra and then you have the scapula okay scapula is on the back part of your shoulder it raises the scapula and the muscle is attached to the corner of the scapula and it and it attaches to the cervical spine one through four okay then you have also one on the left as well but we going to focus on on the one on the right and i and so the purpose of this muscle is to raise the shoulder blade okay it levator scapula muscle it elevates the scapula now there muscle on top of that called the trap okay and that attaches to the back of your skull called the occiput on the spine of the scapula which is an extra little bone right there and then it comes down and attaches to your your thoracic spine through here so it a very broad diamond shaped muscle that is on top of this levator scapulae muscle so when people complain of right trap pain it the levator scapulae muscle but it another root cause underneath that that is tightening up that muscle and it the phrenic nerve goes from the diaphragm and you have one on the left one on the right so it primarily controls the diaphragm which is the muscle so it also has sensory nerves so it has both the sensation and motor control which basically controls the muscle it goes from the diaphragm all the way up to the third through the fifth vertebra okay so that so basically what happens is when your gallbladder or liver is inflamed congested swollen it pressure on that nerve and send signals up to the neck which is going to cause a guarding or a protective mechanism on the levator scapulae muscle which is a tightness that tightness is so you can massage it till the cows come home i had this problem probably my whole life i didn what it was until my late 20s but it the gallbladder usually the people who have pain right up here also have a full sensation underneath the right diaphragm what is there of the little ducts they ducts and then bile is backing up into the liver and bile is a detergent and that is irritating and creating inflammation in the liver as well as in the bile ducts and that is what the problem is and it you have to do is lower your carbohydrates that called healthy keto decrease the omega-6 fatty acids that all the vegetable oils very important i put a video down below for those people who have not been to my channel you need to know about that because that some purified bile salts okay put more information about that what that will do is it will open up the ducts it allows drainage and the inflammation will go down to basically zero in your liver and you start getting a lot of relief do a moderate amount of fats okay don build up your own bile reserve and this is the big one number four cut out snacking that is the killer this grazing all day the snacking never gives your gallbladder a chance to reset and heal it becomes overwhelmed it backs up and you need to cut out the snacking and do what intermittent fasting and then number five is increase your fasting so if you don system has a chance to reset this is so simple and that emphasizing it because it to have this pain over and over again and you from this so try it out and comment down below before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you keto and you need a debug because it not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
The Most Common Nutrient Deficiency in the Elderly	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5zv8bvbBEc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	i want to talk about the top nutritional deficiencies in the elderly it there called the tea and toast syndrome now that happens over time when a diet degenerates into you know consuming a little bit of bread or crackers and tea maybe some occasional canned meats so there deficiencies with that but it have the nursing home which is a bunch of cook foods a lot of sugar low quality foods and snacks that they make available which is going to increase the insulin and etc etc and a lot of the elderly also is on synthetic vitamins they the first ingredient is calcium carbonate which is limestone which is why the bottle is so heavy it not it not to mention that the elderly is on a lot of medications which can deplete you of vitamins especially if they medication especially if they taking diuretics which can deplete the electrolytes so we have that the other factor is the older you get the less stomach acid you have which means you protein and you to pull in the amino acids which you need to help repair and heal the body also you absorb b12 that well and that creates all sorts of problems with energy anemia inflammatory conditions brain issues and also you can minerals that well so there goes potassium calcium magnesium etc the older you get the less nutrients you can absorb and this is especially true for probably one of the biggest nutrient deficiencies in the elderly which is vitamin d this group is not out in the sun they liver oil so there vitamin d deficiency and this is going to affect their immune system vitamin b1 is usually also deficient too as someone gets older and if you videos you know the importance of b1 if you haven below very important of course the other b vitamins as well this is why nutritional yeast is so important so i would recommend for your grandparents is to give them nutritional yeast i would give them vitamin d i would put them on a mineral supplement and a trace mineral supplement so we have low potassium as well which you need for energy and nerve and muscle activation magnesium is going to be a low so it probably why the blood pressure is usually high in the elderly also sodium is going to be low that and the worst thing you can do with someone that is low in sodium is to have them drink a lot of water keep drinking more water thinking they when you and other electrolytes and then they start developing all sorts of issues with that and then of course low trace minerals the most important i think is zinc which is part of so many different chemical pathways in the body so i just wanted to create this video if you have a grandparent or a parent that definitely include some of these nutrients in their diet and if you can get them on keto and then do intermittent fasting before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you and you need a debug because it going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
High / Low Protein in Your Blood: What Does It Mean?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hd9djXb1RE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we proteins the proteins in your blood i try to make it extremely simple and basic because there lot of questions about what does high protein or low protein mean in my blood and also high protein in my urine what does that mean okay so there protein in the blood now there but the two main types of protein are number one albumin which represents about 50 to 60 percent of all your protein in your blood which i second and then antibodies which is the rest of the protein in your blood which but again these two types of protein represent most the protein in your blood now your liver makes albumin and the purpose of albumin is to hold the fluid in your blood so if there going to be able to hold the fluid in the blood so where is it going to go now it going to go out through the urine but it around the cells and we call this edema or swelling in your lower extremities or your legs it can also go into a sac around your abdominal area and that called the cities societies comes from the word that describes a sac that water and this is why when people have liver damage they tend to get this pot belly so number one albumin holds the fluid in your blood number two it nourishes your tissues and number three it acts as a transport it helps to transport hormones like your thyroid hormones electrolytes like calcium potassium and sodium vitamins certain drugs and fatty acids so you can see that protein is really needed for many different functions now let the other type of protein which are antibodies antibodies are produced by certain immune cells the b cells that help you in your immunity so they shaped proteins that are like receptors and they connect with something called an antigen now what is an antigen an antigen is just simply a piece of a pathogen or some foreign thing in the body that doesn so you can look at it like a piece of a virus or a piece of a bacteria so antibodies connect to antigens and they do four things number one they neutralize it because the danger of a pathogen like a virus is when it invades the cell it goes underneath the radar and your immune system cannot detect it anymore so it important to prevent or neutralize that antigen or virus from entering the cell so your antibodies will neutralize or get stuck to this virus and kind of leave it out to dry prevent it from doing anything number two antibodies also tag these pathogens for phagocytosis so the phagocytes can go in there and eat them okay so they help identify the good guys from the bad guys and number three antibodies are involved in inflammation and helping destroy pathogens through using inflammation and there lot more to that in other videos that i and number four and this is very interesting if the virus has invaded the cell already the antibody will cause the infected cell to commit suicide so as you can see there of different strategies going on and the vital importance of this protein in your blood so if your protein is high one reason could be an infection okay there you know a little bit more of what happening in your body and what it trying to do it can also indicate dehydration it can also indicate there cancer in the white blood cells like multiple myeloma now having high or low protein in the blood doesn is happening in the urine okay because if there high levels of protein in the urine that usually means there is kidney damage now there reasons as well i just did a video on that now i below it could mean that you consuming too much protein you did intense exercise you supplement called creatine but kidney damage is at the top of the list if the kidney is damaged then the filter is damaged and you blood anymore so you high protein in the urine and your urine is going to be foamy now there interesting when a person consumes excess amounts of water you can also cause higher levels of protein in the urine as well that not a kidney problem it you then of course if you you the urine as well because of the massive destruction of what diabetes does to the filtering unit in your kidney all right guys so thanks for watching and i hope you now have a great understanding of blood proteins before you go if you have a question about a product or you how to begin keto or you because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Drinking Too Much Beer Will Deplete...	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4W54z0klxQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we of the nutritional deficiencies that can be created when you drink too much alcohol especially beer now many people drink alcohol but this video is mainly for those who drink a lot of beer okay there called photomania it condition medical condition which involves drinking a lot of beer and creating a severe electrolyte imbalance because i want to talk about this because if you know of someone who drinks a lot of beer like teenager whatever this could create a major problem that can be easily prevented now what happens when you drink a lot of beer is you deplete your electrolytes you deplete sodium potassium magnesium and calcium there condition called hyponatremia which is low sodium in your blood and here are the symptoms dizziness weakness seizures headaches you can even go in a coma inability to think confusion nausea of course some of these symptoms are related to a hangover right well a lot of these hangovers occur because of the electrolyte deficient in the first place now if we compound this let someone they and they be losing a lot of sodium and let and they vomit you of sodium and other electrolytes when you vomit and then let which are going to also deplete your electrolytes by doing that and there actually make it worse as well let the person on diuretics or they both of those conditions end up with severe electrolyte deficiencies so you can see i listed all the potential things that can throw off your electrolytes on top of drinking too much beer and last point i want to bring up is if someone is a chronic beer drinker or chronic alcoholic they of deficiencies in their body which will lead to a lot of other symptoms which are then treated with medications which then deplete more nutrients so the whole cycle goes round and round if you want to see more videos on that topic i put them down below check them out before you go if you have a question about a product or you how to begin keto or you because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Autoimmune Conditions: Key Foods to Avoid	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yK32xrQ_9pE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let consuming eggs if you have an autoimmune condition like rheumatoid arthritis ms lupus type 1 diabetes now most autoimmune diseases stem from gut damage okay eighty percent of your immune system is located in the digestive system and if we have the lining of the colon and we break the links and we cause leaky gut proteins can leak into the lymphatic system which is right behind this barrier right here once a protein like the protein in milk or wheat or egg invades this barrier and ends up right in this area right here the lymphatic system your immune system is going to tag this as a foreign toxin okay and now you have an allergy to it and now every time you eat this thing you and these allergic reactions because some of these proteins are similar to your own cells can set you up for an autoimmune disease where now you have antibodies they it molecular mimicry one of the things that i always recommend if you have an autoimmune condition is you go get an allergy test because what identify what you it or the gluten of course if you on my channel you consuming gluten because that but you you may be consuming cheese casein or egg these two right here are common allergies and if you consuming these on your ketogenic diet and you have an autoimmune condition that can actually make things worse so get an allergy test and then you can isolate what you need to avoid for a while common allergies dairy it cheese it it proteins in milk one is casein another is whey and there course grains have the gluten and then you have protein eggs there protein in nuts there test you allergic to and then you can avoid it now another thing that you really need to avoid if you have an autoimmune condition is vegetable oils soy corn canola cottonseed oil all of those are omega-6 fatty acids very inflammatory because dealing with autoimmune conditions is all about reducing inflammation and the last thing you want to do is add more inflammation to an already inflamed body if you don test here three days without consuming any cheese or milk or dairy and just see how you feel and of course we won because i already know you consuming grains but this is a real big one right here the gluten in grains severe inflammatory reactions you may want to go like three days without consuming eggs and see how you feel if you feel better chances are you could be sensitive to it same thing with nuts same thing with seeds the same thing with other proteins like even fish when you do healthy keto and intermittent fasting and you do periodic prolonged fasting what you of your allergies are eventually going to go away because you the immune system all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you know how to begin keto or you because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help you	Success

Why Do I Get Sleepy After Eating Protein? - OKAY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sG8QJP7UKZs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	i had a question from someone that wanted to know why am i getting so sleepy after i eat protein a very simple answer chances are you don hydrochloric acid the purpose of this acid in your stomach is three-fold one is to help you break down proteins number two is to help kill microbes and pathogens and number three is to help increase the absorption of minerals and trace minerals but as far as protein goes if you don have enough stomach acid because maybe you as someone ages they lose the stomach acid over time and this could also be the reason why they they don protein anymore as well and sometimes this could lead to a deficiency in protein in general and the ligaments the tendons the collagen and the joints the best thing to do is to simply restore the hydrochloric acid in your stomach the tane hydrochloride is the remedy i recommend you can get it with or without apple cider vinegar and you can also take apple cider vinegar that can help people with low stomach acid and if you cider vinegar i would recommend taking maybe a tablespoon in a glass of water and sometimes people add lemon juice to that and also realize that sea salt as in sodium chloride the chloride part helps to build hydrochloric acid so one reason why someone might not have enough hydrochloric acid is they don have enough salt in their diet so don neglect this right here as far as the quantity of betaine hydrochloride tablets sometimes you need quite a few sometimes i four to even eight of these before a meal and realize that it could take time to build up this acid it could take several months now also there don could be you that it could also be your deficient in b1 zinc or even potassium all of these are needed to make hydrochloric acid	Success
Vitiligo: Do These 3 Things	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOEWWvwCj_s	Dr. Eric Berg DC	i want to talk about vitiligo vitiligo that it you areas of the body the cells in control of adding pigments to the skin called melanocytes have stopped working correctly now this condition is associated with autoimmune conditions so a lot of times people with vitiligo have other autoimmune conditions but there a lot of unknowns about whether it is an autoimmune condition or not what we do know about vitiligo is there damage okay there a lot of something called ross it creating oxidation free radical damage and hydrogen peroxide okay now it just so happens that these two trace minerals zinc and copper are involved in a very powerful antioxidant super oxide dismutase okay so zinc and copper are needed to make this antioxidant also if a problem has a vitamin d receptor problem it vitamin d receptor they are four times more at risk of getting vitiligo now one treatment they use for vitiligo would be using certain light therapy and we do know there even the sun and vitamin d and lastly there interesting pilot study which i link down below that showed that when a person took 35 000 ius of vitamin d3 there is significant improvements in this condition 14 out of 16 patients had a 25 to 75 percent re-pigmentation that i did another video on vitiligo but i didn recommended for these three supplements so this is what i would recommend if you have this condition i would recommend taking a hundred milligrams of zinc per day i would take 35 000 ius of vitamin d3 every single day and i would take 1500 micrograms not milligrams of copper every single day to support this enzyme and also to help overcome any barriers of vitamin d absorption vitamin d acts like cortisol in the body without the side effects and one of the treatments for vitiligo is to take prednisone or cortisone cream why not take vitamin d instead and hopefully improve this condition without the side effects and as a last note if you haven my other videos on autoimmune conditions in general because vitiligo is associated with autoimmune conditions i would highly recommend doing not just intermittent fasting but periodic prolonged fasting this is essential to help your immune system regenerate all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you keto and you need a debug because it not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Should the Saliva be Acid or Alkaline?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZnBfT96CFc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so someone had a question recently related to the ph of saliva and they about their ph being too acid to alkaline and they wanted to know what should it be well this is the normal ph range of your saliva between 6.2 to 7.6 and anything above 7 goes alkaline anything below 7 is acid 7 being neutral so your saliva could be slightly acidic could be slightly basic or alkaline so it could be both now if your saliva goes too high potentially you can start developing tartar if it acidic you could start developing dental cavities as well as infections in the gum and bad breath and there of other problems that you can develop well you have to realize that in your mouth you have a lot of bacteria that use dietary sugar to make acids and that tooth now if you you could be very very acidic because the definition of keto is just low carb so you can just do a lot of fat and protein and get into ketosis and end up becoming pretty acidic now the type of keto that i recommend is healthy keto which my definition is providing all the nutrients that you need and balancing out your protein fat with vegetable a lot of it between at least seven cups up to 10 cups per day now of course that would be more salad i 10 cups of broccoli for example there no way you do four cups per day but when you talking about salad you have big salads that provides a lot of alkalinity to help balance off these acids so you have a lot of potassium magnesium and also calcium so that way you provide all the nutrients to help buffer any type of foods that could create excessive amounts of you know acids now if someone has candida okay in the mouth they excessive amounts of ammonia and ammonia is very alkaline so that can really throw off your entire ph from this infection right here and also if someone is under chronic stress they tend to become excessively alkaline which is interesting but the real problem is when you talk about ph what fluid of the body are you talking about are you talking about the blood which is slightly alkaline are you talking about the large intestine which is acid or what about the gallbladder and it stomach which is extremely acid so it fluid you if you problem is trying to diagnose someone from having either an acid saliva or an alkaline saliva is pretty much a waste of time because what happening systemically even from your urine what happening in the urine is happening more internally one of the problems with testing the ph of your blood is as soon as you inject the person and take the blood out it quickly oxidizes and it alters the ph so it ph of your blood unless you have some fancy equipment and i know typically that there idea floating around that everyone needs to be alkaline and so start drinking alkaline water and a lot of your problems are going to be cleared out and cancer is acid so if you stay alkaline you that is false information when some people start drinking alkaline water for example because they bought this machine i people and their urine is even at a ph of nine which is incredibly incredibly alkaline typically the urine should be between five maybe six when you have a ph of nine that is so far off the scale that that set you up for a lot of problems because one of the reasons why you want your ph in the urine to be acidic is to prevent bacterial growth so this is not going to do it right here so the bottom line is i wouldn try to correct a ph problem by either taking something that acid or taking something that is more alkaline i would do it by implementing a healthy diet i would try to focus on the diet as much as possible and my opinion is this if you do healthy keto you your ph within the certain fluids at the right level in the urine and the saliva and you don number one you carbs so you starve off this candida and then now you ammonia so this ph will be settled and because you you vegetables with all the minerals that will help balance any acidity from the protein or even fats in summary i don ph very much or the urine ph it doesn give you a lot of valuable data it can be used as one indicator to look deeper inside the body but typically when it when it comes down to it especially from working 29 years in practice if you just get the person corrected ph comes back to where it needs to be thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you and you need a debug because it going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Vaccine-Induced Autoimmunity	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBCgGtEv3Hk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so i today about a topic relating to the vaccine induced autoimmunity the data that i share with you today is based on this textbook called vaccines and autoimmunity okay this textbook is the first peer-reviewed textbook on this topic and this is a collaboration from 77 different universities and a small amount of medical clinics from around the world excluding the united states so this textbook has a tremendous amount of research over decades in relationship to how vaccines could induce autoimmune conditions and today i some real interesting data in this book now before i get into it there syndrome that was recently kind of defined called asia autoimmunity slash inflammation syndrome induced by adjuvants now what adjuvant well in this case an adjuvant is something that enhances the immune response because if you a synthetic viral particle in a vaccine or some type of genetic resequencing of a virus instead of the actual live virus or a dead whole organism the immune response is a lot less so they have to add into a vaccine an adjuvant and aluminum hydroxide is the only approved adjuvant in the united states so let a look at some interesting data in this book all right the first thing is this book called vaccines and autoimmunity is a result of decades of experience in vaccinology immunology and autoimmunity so it goes on to talk about how individual vaccines can trigger autoimmune disease in susceptible individuals and right from the very start they fact that vaccines are delivered to billions of people without preliminary screenings for underlying susceptibility is thus of concern absolutely it is for example it has been shown that the vaccine for lyme disease is capable of triggering arthritis in genetically susceptible hamsters and that when an adjuvant aluminum hydroxide is added to the vaccine 100 of the hamsters develop arthritis that make sure that you do not vaccinate your hamsters with adjuvants all right check this out notably in 1982 compelling evidence from clinical and animal research emerged to show that gilean barrett syndrome it demyelinating autoimmune neuropathies those are conditions where the myelin sheath that protects the nerve is destroyed as in ms could occur up to 10 months following vaccination now in other parts of this book they get into it could be a lot longer so this delayed reaction in such cases the disease would first manifest with vague symptoms arthralgia which is like joint pain myology which is muscle pain paresthesia which is nerve problems and weakness all which are typical of this condition right here which were frequently deemed insignificant and thus ignored by the treating physicians however these symptoms would progress slowly and insidiously until the patient was exposed to a secondary immune stimulants in the form of either infection or vaccination this would then trigger the rapid and acute clinical manifestation of the disease in other words it was the secondary immune response that would bring about an acute overt manifestation of an already present subclinical long-term persisting disease these manifestations pointed to a subclinical slowly evolving disease whether this disease would eventually progress to its full-blown clinical apparent form depended on whether the individual was further exposed to an immune stimulus including subsequent vaccinations as a case in point we recently described six cases of systemic lupus following the hpv vaccination a casual glance at the u.s centers for disease control prevention cdc 2013 immunization schedule for infants shows that according to the u.s prescribed guidelines children receive up to 19 vaccinations during their infancy the various vaccines given to children as well as adults may contain either the whole weakened infectious agent or a synthetic version and genetically engineered antigens of infectious agents and adjuvants typically aluminum what is obvious nonetheless is that a typical vaccine formulation contain all the necessary biochemical components to induce autoimmune manifestations physicians need to be aware that in certain individuals vaccinations can trigger serious and potentially disabling or even fatal autoimmune manifestations finally we wish to encourage efforts towards developing a safer vaccine which could be pursued by the vaccine manufacturing company now there is some real great data i going to put it down below that they using inulin which is a fiber which can act as an adjuvant which has significantly less side effects than aluminum hydroxide now in chapter two they a concept called molecular mimicry okay so of course i have this textbook right here molecular mimicry infection inducing autoimmune diseases fascinating book what this is about is describing a phenomenon that a pathogen like a virus has a certain genetic code or sequence that can mimic our own body tissue or specific parts of our body tissue the virus from the measles can mimic the myelin sheath around our nervous system the rabies virus has a similarity to the insulin receptor papilloma virus also is similar to the insulin receptor then we have the herpes simplex virus which can mimic the acetylcholine receptor now what there gravis which is an autoimmune disease which has antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor then we have the coxy virus which is similar to myosin which is a protein in muscle so what is the significance of this if someone has repeated exposure to an infection a pathogen or a vaccine this potentially causes the cross-reactivity and triggers an autoimmune condition to your myelin or to the insulin receptor as in type 1 diabetes or the acetylcholine receptor as in myasthenia gravis or the oral protein in the muscle creating antibodies to your own muscles and lastly i want to touch a little bit in chapter four and they aluminum adjuvants can penetrate the blood brain barrier actually traveling through the macrophage this then causes a build up of aluminum in the brain and collectively these findings also explain in part why the majority of reported adverse reactions following vaccinations with adjuvants are neurological and neuropsychotic with underlying immunoinflammatory or autoimmune components nonetheless according to khan 2019 continuous increasing doses of the poorly biodegradable aluminum adjuvant may become insidiously unsafe especially in cases of repetitive closely spaced vaccinations otherwise known as vaccine re-challenge and lastly there are three main risks involved with this adjuvant aluminum it can persist in the body up to 11 years following the vaccination number two it can trigger pathological responses and number three it can make its way into the central nervous system where it can drive further immunoinflammatory reactions and the last thing i want to mention is if you are in a situation where you forced to get a vaccination i would recommend to take certain natural compounds to help bind with the adjuvant aluminum to minimize damage control in the description down below i put a series of things that i would recommend on that thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you know how to begin keto or you because it i have a keto

Left Side Abdominal Pain Under Ribs Â Causes & Remedies Covered by Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK5qHLpq408	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now i abdominal pain but i really haven talked too much about pain on the left side other than maybe one video and it find so this video is on what happens if you have pain underneath the rib cage on the left side what could that be you have the liver here you have the pancreas here so your liver is right here and your pancreas is on the left side you have the gallbladder on the right side and then you have all these little tubes that help drain bile biles made in your liver it drains through these little tubes they and most of it gets stored in the gallbladder and it five to seven times so then when you eat it gets contracted and it squeezes out through here into your small intestine well you also have a pancreas that makes enzymes so the enzymes especially like when you fats the pancreas releases the enzyme called lipase which helps break down the fats but there created by the pancreas and secreted if you look at this area right here which is kind of right in your below your stomach area right here in the mid part you have a joining of these bile ducts with the pancreatic ducts so if by chance there gallstone or obstruction in the in these pipes right through in here or down here there goes into the pancreas because these enzymes are now dissolving and irritating itself so typically pancreatitis comes from either way too much alcohol or gall stones but up to 40 percent of the time there means unknown cause but if you look up more data on this there something called biliary sludge it stone where you sludge that is very hard to detect on either a cat scan mri or even ultrasound because the crystals are very very small and i if you want more information about this but what happens if you have sludge that kind of clogging up these little pipes right here and you have these little valves that might not close properly we getting the drainage it can back up and create this right here so this sludge is concentrated cholesterol crystals this does not come from having high cholesterol or consuming too much dietary cholesterol it comes from having a lack of bile because it is the bile that is a key thing in your body to help regulate this amount of concentrated cholesterol it the bile that helps keep the cholesterol thinned and when you for gall stones increase you get more bilirubin sludge and you start getting these crystals the solution is not necessarily to go on a low cholesterol diet it more purified bile salts because when you do that that will help to thin this cholesterol bile material and allow drainage to occur but if we go deeper and talk about what you need to do to make sure that your body produces more bile there things that you can do cut your carbs down that healthy keto do intermittent fasting cut down the amount of grains that you consume because when you increase grains you increase insulin and too much insulin can deplete your bile reserve also too much estrogen can do it too so if you or even when a woman is pregnant and she has a spike in estrogen that can mess with the bile that women that are pregnant have a higher risk of getting gallstones same thing with women that are taking estrogen replacement therapy vegetable oils are omega-6 highly inflammatory this can also increase insulin and create insulin resistance which then creates a problem with that having too many nuts or nut butters can give you too many omega-6 fatty acids and irritate this area right here of course we talked about alcohol you going to have to cut down your alcohol to no more than a six-pack on a weekend number seven corn most corn is gmo that means it has glyphosate which is very irritating to the inner lining of your bile ducts right through in here also it course taking purified bile salts this would be very very important take one in them in the morning on an empty stomach and take one in the evening on an empty stomach and that can gradually help keep this flow opened and keep it drained and reduce the inflammation all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you and you need a debug because it going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Hyperkalemia (High Blood Potassium Levels) Â Hyperkalemia Symptoms & Treatment Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKW99YifhHs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	we potassium in your blood okay first thing you need to know is the name of that is hypercalemia when you have a deficiency of potassium in the blood that hypokalemia the other thing to know which is very important is that 98 of all your potassium in your body is inside your cell not outside the cell and not in your blood so when we we so we don picture of what rare there are very little symptoms that are associated with this if it you can be very tired and have muscle pain and weakness there pseudo hyperkalemia in this situation when they get the sample to do the testing if they damage your blood cells as they of trauma involved what happens is it cracks open these cells and leaks out more potassium giving this pseudo or false impression that you have high levels of potassium so i just want to bring this point up right here now there might have high levels of potassium in the blood advanced kidney disease is probably the number one because when the kidney is damaged you don release certain minerals especially potassium addison is another reason this is an autoimmune condition of your adrenal glands in which you and when you you potassium so you would not necessarily ever want to give someone potassium if they had advanced kidney disease or addison there also raise your potassium in the blood nsaids for pain and certain high blood pressure medications now the other thing to know is excessive intake of potassium is not a primary cause of hyperkalemia why because your body has certain mechanisms to get rid of excessive potassium and this is very different from sodium we tend to retain sodium so if we take too much potassium our bodies can get rid of it very easily through the urine now what is the treatment for hyperkalemia is taking certain types of calcium or injecting the person with insulin and i medical treatment or dextrose which is a sugar or sodium bicarbonate which is baking soda now what i find interesting is these two things right here insulin and dextrose so if you you or you going to create more of a problem with this right here not this right here now it the opposite of hyperkalemia hypokalemia which is way more common it imbalance when someone and here are a few symptoms leg cramps weakness constipation abnormal heart rhythm issues arrhythmias etc and the main point i want to bring up which is the last point is you have to realize that the majority the vast majority of potassium is inside the cell and so measuring it based on the blood is not a good way to determine if you have too much or too little potassium there is another test it intracellular potassium test which is much more valuable and i going to put a link down below if you want to know more information about that i would highly suggest to get this test if you knowing your intracellular potassium and intracellular magnesium it gives you a lot of great data and it can also tell you if you getting arrhythmias because that would be one of the big symptoms of that or even high blood pressure all right thanks for watching and i see you in the next video before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you and you need a debug because it going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Fibrocystic Breast: The Best Remedy is...	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWeXMuGZvOQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let disease what it it amount of tissue that fibrous tissue in certain parts of the breast it could potentially be a pre-k this problem is an iodine deficiency because iodine protects the body tissues against excessive amounts of estrogen especially in the breast iodine mostly concentrates in your thyroid but 30 of your iodine reserves are concentrated in the breast tissue the eyes the stomach the cervix and the salivary glands now what foods have iodine sea kelp okay seaweed which by the way is sea kale but there seaweed in addition to sea cat you have salt water fish shellfish egg yolks have iodine and it just so happens that in japan where they consume a lot of sea kelp and seaweed they have the lowest breast cancer mortality rates i mean check this out we have 6.6 out of a hundred thousand people versus the u.s which has a breast cancer mortality rate of 27.7 for every 100 000 women so it appears that iodine is very protective against breast cancer now there i check out estrogen treated mice with an iodine deficiency develop cysts and by supplementing them with iodine there is a 77.7 percent beneficial effect so if your pet mice develop fibrocystic breast disease make sure that you feed them iodine because you wouldn with that all right thank you so much for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you know how to begin keto or you because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
What Causes a Goiter? Iodine Deficiency & Thyroid Nodules Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRaoSg7UEZM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so i wanted to touch on the topic of the thyroid gland but specifically a goiter what is a goiter a goiter is an enlarged thyroid gland you have this little gland in the brain called the pituitary it makes a hormone called thyroid stimulating hormone which then connects to the thyroid gland two main purposes of the thyroid stimulating hormone number one it tells the thyroid to release t4 and t3 to some degree but it also has another purpose to increase the size of the thyroid gland so if there that could be one reason why it enlarged and one of the big reasons for a goiter would be an iodine deficiency in fact ninety percent of the time it going to be an iodine deficiency not a hundred percent ninety percent and realize most of time it benign it now this condition mostly is associated with a hypothyroid gland but sometimes it can be associated with a hyper thyroid gland so you have to be able to think with all the information because if you have an enlarged thyroid and you have symptoms of a hyper your eyes are bulging out you have a high pulse rate fast metabolism you can versus hypo which is you you um you more over here okay so if you have hypo of course you want to take iodine if you have hyper you don several reasons why a person might be deficient in iodine one could be they just don because they shellfish or seaweed or sea kelp or eggs for example but it could also be they used as a conditioner in dough or flour when they bread that could be one reason there ways that you could be exposed to bromide but bromide will deplete iodine also fluoride unless you have a good filter at your house you fluoride that can deplete your iodine too number three i already talked about this number four pregnancy it is pregnant or lactating that they taking some trace minerals specifically iodine because if that child is born with iodine deficiency they can have hearing problems even become death and they can also have mental deficiencies as well so iodine is very very important in the formation of the brain smoking can cause a deficiency of iodine alcohol can create a deficiency and low selenium now when someone has a goiter and they get tested they may find that their t3 is a little bit higher than it should be now that would be low but what is the body is trying to convert as much as it can to compensate so you might have higher t3 and lower t4 all right that of the goiter before you go if you have a question about a product or you know how to begin keto or you debug because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
How Effective is Chemotherapy, Really?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r14pSzQQNnk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so how effective is chemotherapy really the contribution of chemo to a five-year survival rate in adults in one report which i link down below in australia it the u.s it mean it means that if you had a group of people who took chemo at the end of five years only 2.1 percent of them would still be alive the rest would be dead now what i meant to replace your medical care check with your doctor before taking any advice i do chemo i that i suggest that you need to research there that i want to talk about one is relative risk and the other is absolute risk when you drug or some treatment you really don to know the relative risk you want to know the absolute risk let say for example before chemo it was found that two people out of 100 die and after chemo one out of 100 would die what would the relative risk look like well it would look like this chemo decreases cancer mortality rate by 50 if you take the chemo you than a 2x chance of surviving for five years so chemo will double your rate of survival that sounds very hopeful doesn look at what it actually means now if we take a look at these numbers okay and if we look at the absolute risk it gives a different picture chemo decreases cancer mortality rate by one percent okay because we from two to one remember these are fractions they so drug companies and certain people that want to make their study look way better than it really is will always talk about relative risks okay and they won if you have cancer and you with chemo the only thing you want to know is how long will it prolong your life right here that ask your doctor if i take this chemo how much longer am i going to live that and then after they tell you you want to request the study and actually read it yourself to see if it matches up so we have two problems number one we want to know what their definition of effectiveness is and number two we want to know how safe it is because chemo is a poison because if it barely gives you any results and at the same time it some major toxicity you want to really weigh out your choices now the other thing that i would do if i was talking to an oncologist is i would want to know if they are open to alternative therapy or natural type things because there is some significant science behind using natural things to affect cancer and you just want to know if they open to it and if they they have a fixed idea and they the information that and the last thing i want to mention is if you haven seyfried on cancer i think you interesting check it out i put it up right here	Success
Hidden Reason for Prostate Enlargement Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58ddoKMDOko	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let prostate enlargement that is this right here too much estrogen in the body now typically men have low amounts of estrogen except for two exceptions one is in utero which it means before you were born and number two when you get older now the vast majority of estrogen that you have actually comes from your testosterone your testosterone converts into estrogen with this enzyme right here aromatase your testes do produce some estrogen 20 but 80 of the rest of your estrogen comes from the periphery additional organs and tissues the brain tissue the skin bone and your fat cells and because estrogen is an anabolic hormone it makes things grow there interact with this and this will stimulate the growth and even increase your risk of prostate cancer so what is the solution to this problem number one help normalize estrogen by losing weight that would be number one but there are also aromatase inhibitors that you can take that are natural one would be maca root now believe it or not maca root is in the cruciferous family of vegetables it you also have stinging nettle root which is a very good herb that also is a good anti-inflammatory as well and then you have all the cruciferous vegetables which are anti-estrogen because they inhibit this enzyme right here so what you want to do is you want to do a healthy version of keto with intermittent fasting for those of you who are new i link down below but also make sure that you include either maca root or stingy nail root or even yet start consuming a lot more cruciferous vegetables in your diet and i think that could greatly help you with this situation before you go if you have a question about a product or you how to begin keto or you because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Why Chronic Inflammation Causes Anemia (Iron Deficiency) Â Anemia of Chronic Disease Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbQeaivmgb4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so i have a very interesting video on chronic inflammation and anemia now check this out one of the first line of defense against pathogens in our body is the withholding of nutrition or starvation from other microbes now iron and a few other trace minerals are required for microbes to grow so in other words both the good bacteria and the bad pathogens need iron or they require iron to be able to grow that foods so i want to introduce you to a word called sequestration this word describes a condition where your body is binding up for locking up iron and other trace minerals to prevent pathogens from getting that food so the free iron that you had in the body is rapidly being bound up by certain compounds so we have this interesting game between your body and pathogens your body sensing an infection and inflammation and a fever will quickly lock up that iron to prevent the pathogens from growing the pathogen has counter strategies to break open your cells and get that iron both the good and bad bacteria are trying to survive but your body if it able to do its job and prevent the microbe from growing and this is why when certain people have too much iron they have a certain condition where they can absolutely not get rid of iron and they just have too much they infections that the microorganism and lyme disease has developed a strategy to get its food from not iron but from manganese so it take your iron i manganese and it what you get this infection or you have this inflammation so you have this thing going on right here and then you overcome the infection and the inflammation the fever goes away and now this iron is available now for your cells to use to grow but what happens when you go into a chronic inflammatory condition okay as an autoimmune problem whether it rheumatoid arthritis or whatever you can become very deficient in iron and become anemic and feel weak in your mind you might say well okay well i some iron here to feed my body and give it more trace minerals well the problem is you the pathogens at the same time a much better strategy would be to handle the deeper root cause of the inflammation whether it is a subclinical microbial infection or just your immune system is out of control and it tissues in which case fasting is the answer to that regular intermittent fasting with periodic prolonged fasting if you definitely need to see those videos i put those down below and in addition to fasting vitamin d in larger amounts minimally 30 000 ius but probably 40 000 or more would be necessary to help reduce the inflammation and that would allow your body to make these trace minerals especially iron more available to your own tissue so you can actually use it and i thought this was interesting especially to those who have chronic inflammatory conditions before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you keto and you need a debug because it not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Iron Deficiency Symptoms and Causes of Anemia Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqCensiK8Ac	Dr. Eric Berg DC	did you realize that over a billion people on this planet are deficient in iron i was actually pretty surprised to hear that so today we iron deficiency anemia so here are the symptoms fatigue pale like you nails you get those little grooves in your nails hair loss thinning of the hair twitching feeling irritation pica you crave dirt or clay number nine you have the urge to consume ice or chew on ice and number ten restless leg syndrome now there the main ones now the question is what is causing this well excessive menstruation okay excessive bleeding and by the way if you cycles are very heavy that means you have estrogen dominance i you to watch later but there reverse that problem number two ulcers it could be an ulcer in the stomach or even the small intestine that you don number three hemorrhoids i have a very good video on this um you want to support your liver there i also have a remedy on this as well i going to put the link down below it involving taking zinc number four colon cancer could potentially cause anemia number five dietary you beans and grains and plants those food have what iron and you only absorb a very very small amount it of the iron so you tremendous amount of plants to get your iron the problem is a lot of the plants and grains have certain things like oxalates or phytates that block iron the best source of bioavailable iron is called heme iron is from seafood red meat poultry eggs and even insects have a high level of heme iron just in case that you may get that urge you know late at night if you want a snack and i sarcastic all right number six certain antibiotics can deplete you of iron number seven low stomach acid a lot of people have this they don lose the stomach acid and now you cannot absorb certain minerals especially iron and even calcium number eight malabsorption if you have some type of problem in your colon or you a gallbladder or you had surgery as in gastric bypass that can leave you with a hard time absorbing iron and number nine and this is fascinating i just on this but inflammation can deplete your iron how well both good bacteria and bad bacteria as in pathogens need iron to grow and what happens within your immune system your body as well as your good bacteria tend to lock up or bind iron during an infection during a fever and during inflammation so what happens as a survival mechanism your body prevents the pathogens from getting a hold of the free iron and that is one strategy to help limit their growth now what after the infection the inflammation goes away but what happens if you have chronic inflammation because you have some type of autoimmune condition rheumatoid arthritis lupus or whatever that is going to end up depriving your whole body of a lot of trace minerals iron being a very specific one and so the more chronic the inflammation the more anemic you could be now you might say well i ahead and solve this problem by taking more iron right well you pathogens and then they can actually grow and you so how do you solve that what you do is you get rid of the actual source of the inflammation there couple things that i would recommend i number one fasting periodic prolonged fasting is essential and a lot of vitamin d both of those can help reduce the inflammation without adding in the iron for the pathogens so now you know the symptoms and what causes anemia and if you haven chronic inflammation and anemia i it out you	Success
#1 Cause of Hypertension Â Hyperinsulinemia and High Insulin Levels Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgBFzIY7Hx4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let hypertension now hypertension is classified in two different categories one is primary or essential hypertension and then you have secondary hypertension which mainly comes from a kidney disease or maybe a tumor etc but the vast majority 95 of hypertension is called essential or primary which basically means unknown cause now that can be related to lifestyle salt smoking alcohol etc etc but if you dive into research on this which i below there having too much insulin as in hyperinsulinemia now with a hyper insulin state too much insulin you resistance as well so the fact that you have insulin resistance will cause the pancreas to make more insulin and having more insulin will then cause those receptors to downgrade and cause insulin resistance so they both feed on each other now one of the mechanisms of why high insulin will do this is that when you have high insulin it stimulates the autonomic nervous system primarily the sympathetic nervous system which which has one effect of raising the blood pressure the other thing that high amounts of insulin will do it it very very stiff causing hypertension and of course the best thing to do which is rarely ever done is to do a test to see if you have insulin resistance and high insulin levels while you fasting this is the test that should be done homa ir if you had hypertension and you did this test chances are you would find that you do have insulin resistance and high insulin which by the way is behind type 2 diabetes it is the thing that brews in the oven for many many years until you develop pre-diabetes and then actual type 2 diabetes so this is number one and by the way this is also behind the metabolic syndrome where you have high blood pressure high glucose high cholesterol belly fat now there are several other reasons why someone might go up as well low potassium but here if you have too much insulin and insulin resistance you potassium because because you need normal functioning insulin to be able to absorb potassium and the other reason why this is a common cause is because we need so much of it dietarily we need 4 700 milligrams every single day instead they heavy on the sodium and very light on the potassium but for a lot of people they their potassium level they it and all of a sudden their blood pressure comes down so this is a really common cause too that can be aggravated by this right here all right number three low vitamin d levels vitamin d has a very powerful effect over blood pressure and the vast majority is vitamin d deficient and a good percentage of them have high blood pressure will show there correlation but there i that show that when you take vitamin d your blood pressure comes down and i would recommend if you have hypertension to take at least 20 000 iu maybe even more to help you with your blood pressure and sometimes it takes a couple days before you see the results but you can test yourself before and after number four low magnesium magnesium is an electrolyte it works with potassium you also need vitamin d to help you absorb magnesium and also magnesium helps you absorb vitamin d and it just so happens that magnesium is in the same foods that you would eat with potassium but magnesium is a relaxer of your blood vessels and if you don things tend to stay stiff and your pressure will go up number five low vitamin k2 which you need with vitamin d3 they work together vitamin k2 helps to keep the calcium out of the arteries where it should not be and so if you are deficient in vitamin k2 you could potentially build up more calcium in the arteries and that can make things very very stiff and this comes from fatty foods so if you you k2 also if you blocks cholesterol that can inhibit this as well as well as this right here and also statin drugs increase your risk of getting this right here so if you and you keto and intermittent fasting i put a link down below for more information to help you with this right here but what it can do is help you support a healthy lifestyle as well as to help you support healthy insulin levels because you carbohydrates and if i were to look at the ketogenic diet and intimate fasting on what would be a greater impact on helping you lower insulin i would go with intermittent fasting but the combination works even better and one last point this information is not meant to replace your medical care don check with your doctor first before you go if you have a question about a product or you know how to begin keto or you debug because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Number ONE Cause of Chronic Fatigue: 50 Years or Older	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxgF2p39QkU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so let of chronic fatigue if you some very interesting information this has to do with low stomach acids let me give you a little background first the purpose of stomach acid hydrochloric acid is to number one break down protein into amino acids number two to help you absorb minerals like iron and magnesium calcium etc but also hydrochloric acid is also necessary for helping you absorb b12 so both types of anemia is related to low stomach acid also the hydrochloric acid is necessary to kill microbes in your gut if you don enough acid you can develop a condition called sibo small intestine bacterial overgrowth and the problem with that condition is you have other microbes which are in a place where they shouldn competing for your nutrients so that one reason why you right there but if you iron or b12 even at the subclinical level you are going to be tired not to mention if you consume protein especially red meat and you can it you many reasons why low stomach acid leads to fatigue and just as a side note if you don acid in your stomach you can get gerd indigestion bloating allergies and even gallstones now what of hydrochloric acid and your age as you get older you produce less and less hydrochloric acid in fact there a link down below that talked about a high percentage of postmenopausal women having low stomach acid and that was up to 40 percent so that there atrophic gastritis in which a person has atrophy of certain parts of their stomach caused by low stomach acid and that usually occurs if you 60. so this acid is so bodily important especially when you get older especially in the area of nutrients because the older you get the more absorption of these nutrients that you need now there also a condition called idiopathic which means unknown cause iron deficiency anemia and one study which i discusses the high rate up to 44 of the population who has idiopathic iron deficiency anemia has a chlorhydra which is a lack of stomach acid so what you need to know is a lot of people don in their stomach and things get worse as you age and this directly relates to your energy level other causes of low stomach acid could be having severe hypothyroidism being on a low salt diet not having enough potassium in your diet having low amounts of iodine having low amounts of zinc these nutrients are needed in producing hydrochloric acid and of course if you that can also be a root cause as well so what is the solution to all this very simple start taking betaine hydrochloride it recommend taking between four and five just before you eat and sometimes in the beginning you might need actually more than that when you that it might take some time to reestablish this hydrochloric acid especially if it notice some significant results within days to maybe up to a week and one last point the only contraindication that i know about with betaine hydrochloride is if you have an ulcer and you because if you take this if you have an ulcer you but for the majority of population you feel better you energy and you better all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you know how to begin keto or you debug because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone number down below so you can call and get some help	Success

Tanning Beds: Any Vitamin D?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKf8K-Gc-vE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today let you actually get your vitamin d from getting a tan in your tanning bed now before i answer that question i want to explain something about getting your vitamin d from sun now the sun doesn into your body okay what it does is it emits a wavelength a frequency an energy that penetrates a certain layer of your skin and in that layer of your skin it the fourth layer down it triggers cholesterol to create a change chemically into vitamin d but at that stage it form of vitamin d3 it vitamin d3 so the sun with cholesterol to make vitamin d3 now that inactive vitamin d has to be then activated through two other organs the liver and especially the kidney so if you have damage in your liver or kidney you the active form if you have more pigment in your skin let that will block this conversion and if you conversion if you conversion so there that can inhibit you from achieving your optimum vitamin d levels now here that you need to know now that wavelength called uv or ultraviolet is not just one wavelength it of three so it the one that makes vitamin d is uv ultraviolet b the ultraviolet a wavelength does not make vitamin d and that use in the tanning beds so if you you getting vitamin d the problem with being exposed to uva is it penetrates deeper it can actually create genetic damage into the dna and 95 of the uv rays are this type so if it has the ability to create genetic damage and tan your skin or even age your skin and it doesn increase your conversion of vitamin d it can increase the risk of melanomas now with the sun you you and you but a tanning bed only has that uv a and so the key thing about this topic is whether you get vitamin d or not because vitamin d is protective against cancer it anti-melanoma and your susceptibility of getting cancer and as you become deficient in vitamin d your susceptibility of getting cancer goes way up so for that reason tanning beds come with a package you might get a tan but you don that protective vitamin d to protect you against skin cancer and other problems now it get your vitamin d from food for example three ounces of salmon this will only give you 447 international units of vitamin d3 three ounces of tuna only give you 154 iu 388. three ounces of beef liver is only 42 international units and one egg only gives you 41 international units and for most people that either are overweight have malabsorption issues have diabetes i mean they need between 6 000 to 10 000 ius every single day now i forgot to mention one tablespoon of cod liver oil will give you 1360 iu of vitamin d3 more than any of the other foods all right guys thanks for watching and i have a lot of videos on vitamin d3 and i put some up right here check them out	Success
Isn't Our Body Supposed to Run on Sugar?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7Ga0Cx0U1Q	Dr. Eric Berg DC	all right guys i your questions on the youtube channel and facebook and this next video is based on a kind of a comment not a question it basically a disagreement someone said dr berg you don you because our bodies were meant to run on glucose especially the brain and i wanted to do a video on this topic because i think it it is true that a certain part of your body can only run on glucose okay but a greater portion of your body can also run on ketones and fatty acids i mean if you just think about this logically most people in america especially are overweight they around their body now the question is what is the purpose of fat is it just an insulator is it just to protect you against the cold or act as a cushion if you fall down or could it be that that fat that you have is a fuel storage to survive between meals our bodies only store roughly about 1700 calories of stored sugar but a thin person has about a hundred thousand calories of stored fat so based on logics our bodies were meant to run on fat more than glucose but it is true that certain parts of our body only can live on glucose and that would be the red blood cells your liver yeah your liver actually cannot run on ketones 30 of your brain especially certain parts of your pituitary and hypothalamus need glucose certain parts of the kidney can only run on glucose and the lens of the eye needs glucose but here thing there gluconeogenesis that is a condition where your body is actually making glucose from non-carbohydrate sources like fat and ketones that it can make it from ketones so you do not need from your diet any glucose to survive at all in fact when you start putting your body into a state of ketosis and you start feeding the brain ketones and your heart ketones you see all sorts of amazing things that occur improvements in focus memory ability to learn and your overall mood and just because i of brain physiology there a hippocampus and that structure if damaged leads to dementia and alzheimer thrives it improves when you feed it ketones and it worsens when you feed it glucose so both the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex thrives on ketones and this is exactly why when you get into ketosis your focus is better your memory gets better and your concentration improves and so if you channel and this is all new to you definitely watch some videos down below so you can experience the massive benefits before you go if you have a question about a product or you know how to begin keto or you debug because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Is a Niacin Flush Harmful or Dangerous?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BafsDqvqf3w	Dr. Eric Berg DC	had a recent question from someone that wanted it now is the niacin flesh harmful or dangerous well the answer is no it is not harmful or dangerous what massive relaxation of the muscles inside your blood vessels it occurring because niacin increases something called prostaglandins now what is a prostate glandin it lipid or fat compound that has a hormone effect and prostaglandins increase vasodilation they help reduce blood pressure it helps blood clotting it involved in headaches and fever this is why when you take an aspirin which blocks prostaglandins and it can reduce a fever so that you red response some people don they think it something some people like it i actually like it myself i like that flushing response but it dangerous at all the thing you need to know about niacin is that it therapeutically has been used over 50 years and it is the most effective natural agent for increasing your hdl the good cholesterol by 20 to 40 percent it also can decrease the ldl specifically the small dense type the damaging ldl and it can has the potential to decrease your triglycerides now of course if you did the ketogenic diet and your intermittent fasting that would help your cholesterol greatly but if you cholesterol you should be on niacin for sure but you would have to take higher amounts of it one to two thousand milligrams a day now if you take the type of niacin that is non-flushing it doesn those cholesterol lowering benefits now the other thing that niacin has been proven beneficial for is by reducing schizophrenia there this i below but niacin has many other benefits but these are two big benefits if you haven niacin i right here check them out	Success
Swollen Face and Puffy Eyes: An Easy Fix	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU6CczYqS8o	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let a swollen face and puffy eyes now you may have this problem or you may know people who have this problem and it understand this one thing there there slash ketones well actually that would be three but let ketones together since ketones are made from fat so those are the two fuel sources and you store glucose as glycogen so glycogen is the main storage of glucose and you store fat as adipose tissue storing glucose as glycogen is extremely limited okay you only store a very small amount of it but with fat it has no limit it people can gain weight over five six seven hundred pounds over a thousand pounds and it just keeps going there you can store but with glycogen it to around i would say 1700 calories now the question is why is it so limited well it it your body to store glucose as glycogen it requires a tremendous amount of water it will store a little more than three times its weight in fluid so we with something that waterlogged and there space to store that much hydrated waterlogged material so the way the body will handle that is that it that comes from the diet and very efficiently converts it over to fat so if you glucose in the diet you fat and you fluid and it shows up in the face as a swollen face and especially around the eyes as puffy eyes in fact i had this problem in some of the earlier videos i did when i wasn intermittent fasting or the ketogenic diet but the good news is if you have the right information it very easy to fix all you have to do is eliminate the excess amount of glucose in the diet now this is where the confusion comes in [Music] what is considered excess and what is considered normal if you take a look at the amount of glucose that normally should be in your blood when you test your blood and measure your blood glucose and it says 80 milligrams per deciliter that normal that means you only have one tiny little teaspoon in the entire amount of blood in your body so it only designed to have a very tiny amount of sugar and that sugar can be easily created from non-carbohydrate sources you do not need to consume sugar to keep your blood sugars at 80. but the average person in america consumes 31 teaspoons of sugar every single day so you can see the problem there of people walking around with a swollen fat face with puffy eyes if you would like to know exactly what to do to reverse both of these problems i put the link down below check it out before you go if you have a question about a product or you how to begin keto or you because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Is Your Child Clumsy or Not Coordinated?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dH1rB64MfU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	have you noticed that your child little clumsy or not coordinated so in this video i want to talk about the potential for a nutritional deficiency the reason may not be something they just normally born with but there nutritional deficiency so let about this topic there is a condition called ataxia ataxia comes from the greek word meaning lack of order so ataxia is a condition where the left side of the body is not coordinated with the right there coordinated movements muscle movements and the inability to judge distances so let going to shoot a football and you completely overshoot or undershoot now that could be a lack of training in that sport or it could be maybe a subclinical version of ataxia now if you look at the underlying causes for ataxia there all sorts of things from brain tumor to cancer to head injury but there interesting causes as well and one big interesting cause would be a vitamin b1 deficiency i mean if you think about a severe case of b1 deficiency called beriberi one big effect is destruction of neurons in your brain because the vitamin b1 is involved in so many things in the body including brain function myelin sheath that surrounds the nerves digestion cardiovascular function and impairment to certain parts of your brain now before i talk more about b1 i want to talk about other causes of ataxia alcohol is one trigger certain drugs will cause ataxia lithium can cause ataxia a buildup of mercury can cause ataxia a severe b12 deficiency can cause it having gluten sensitivity can cause ataxia in fact there called gluten ataxia which i do a separate video on where gluten the protein in certain grains can actually destroy neurons in your brain so there that can cause ataxia but what is the relationship between vitamin b1 deficiency and ataxia and the primary way which a child would become deficient in vitamin b1 would be consuming too much refined rice too much refined grain and too much sugar not to mention gluten as well vitamin b1 is in the bran which is the fiber part of the grain i well in fact a very severe b1 deficiency is called beriberi and that was originally discovered by certain communities consuming too much milled or refined polished rice i mean how many children are living on refined carbohydrates in sugar i mean it now if you consume whole grains with the bran it with phytates and that can block zinc another deficiency that shows up in a very large population of children what i saying is if your child is not as coordinated as they should be start to get them off these refined grains and sugar and give them some b1 and see if it doesn before you go if you have a question about a product or you how to begin keto or you because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Protocol for Calcified Plaque in Your Arteries Â Atherosclerosis Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hkWSdtVGcg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	all right so we what to do if you have calcification in your arteries i really good test that you can do to determine if you do have calcium in your arteries in fact it best predictors of mortality so i information on that if you are not familiar with that test but this video is on a protocol that i would recommend to help undo the calcification in your arteries of course the best thing is to prevent it but what do you do if you actually have calcium buildup in the arteries all the things that i about are not meant to replace your medical care just do your own research i put some links down below for every single thing i the first natural compound is allicin which happens to be the phytonutrient in garlic some real interesting research on the association of allicin and decrease artery calcification in animals so if you have a pet with a calcified coronary artery start feeding them garlic immediately number two butyrate now what is butyrate butyrate is a compound that your microbes in your gut make when you feed the microbes fiber and i going to recommend vegetable fiber but it is actually a type of fat it acid that microbes from vegetable fiber and that too is associated with a decreased risk of artery disease now number three lycopene this is a phytonutrient in tomatoes it vegetables and there of showing how lycopene can decrease the thickness of the wall of your arteries and also decrease the stiffness and this is why sometimes you some crazy claims that oh now you can have ketchup and it risk for heart disease because ketchup has lycopene of course we know that happen now also if you add olive oil when you greatly increase the amount of lycopene up to 82 percent and that is because like other phytonutrients lycopene is a fat soluble compound which means it requires bile and adding more oil into the diet can greatly enhance the absorption all right number four omega-3 fatty acids the sabian fish oils definitely cod liver oil which i recommend more than fish oils i mean we know that omega-3 is good for so many things but its main action in relationship to your arteries is the decrease in inflammation but it can also increase the risk of getting a clot now on the flip side the omega 6 fatty acids increase stiffness of the arteries and it can increase the clotting factor and when i talking about the soy oil the corn oil the canola the cotton seed now there is one type of omega-6 that is very friendly to your arteries and it doesn inflammation and that would be called gla or gamma linolenic acid this would be like borage oil black currant seed oil evening primrose oil so gla can help decrease inflammation it can help decrease thickness in your arteries it can also decrease the plaque formation in your arteries i put some links down below very very interesting all right number six vitamin k2 you probably knew this was coming i would recommend getting the mk7 version and i would consume about 300 micrograms every single day now what does vitamin k2 do it activates a certain protein that inhibits calcium from forming in the arteries so that number seven tocotrinols tocotrienols is one form of the vitamin e complex and it tocopherols and it can greatly decrease inflammation in your arteries it can decrease something called c-reactive protein which is an inflammatory compound by 40 and lastly and most importantly is doing whatever you can to decrease and reverse insulin resistance there relationship between having insulin resistance and having calcification in your arteries and so a lot of these other remedies are not going to work unless you also correct insulin resistance how if you new to my channel i put the link down below you need to do healthy keto and definitely intermittent fasting for a period of time to start making changes but it opinion that the combination of addressing insulin resistance with tocotrienols with k2 with allicin and omega-3 are probably the most important things you can do and these other compounds are are also good but i think using them more as a secondary approach thanks so much for watching i next video before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you keto and you need a debug because it not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
What to do For Lump in Throat? Â Remedies by Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAzRA1oywfw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so i want to talk about the symptom of having a lump in your throat a sensation that there something in there but there nothing in there what is this condition what can you do about it there names for this condition if you wanted to know this it important but what i today is some basic data on really what look at these structures right through here we have the pharynx which is in the back of the throat right here and let here so the tongue is right here the jaw is right here and then we go from the pharynx right below it we have the larynx that vocal cords you have a lot of other stuff going on there you have muscles and ligaments and cartilage right through here right below this you have the trachea the trachea is a structure that has an opening into your lungs okay so that then right behind the trachea you have the esophagus that down into the stomach and you have various valves and controls or sphincters sphincter is a muscular valve that can close like this and that of your autonomic nervous system and there structure to control the food to make sure the food doesn and that you have a lot going on in this area right here with nerves and muscles and tendons and cartilage and the coordination of allowing air and food and speaking now about a couple years ago i was doing lunch with an old client that i had and as i was sitting there i noticed that she started choking after she consumed some soup with some chunks of chicken and it got stuck in her throat and she and i where i had to perform the heimlich maneuver and i how to do it and so i go behind her and i start to do the procedure and it doesn she he everyone oh my gosh she to pass out and at that moment what came to mind is that this area of your body the vocal cords the structures in this area are highly innervated by the autonomic nervous system both the parasympathetic which is the vagus nerve as well as the sympathetic fibers and so what i told her is i just said relax just calm down just try to relax now i know it difficult to try to get someone to calm down when they can she just sat down she relaxed and then she could start breathing and so one of the reasons i brought that up is that one of the triggers for having this lump in the throat sensation is stress so when you go through stress you activate these fingers and things can close up and you can have all sorts of problems including laryngitis and all sorts of hoarseness and problems with your vocal cords as well so this symptom can be activated by stress a virus low vitamin d levels which we come back to that gerd which is an acid reflux situation and even a problem with the vagus nerve one of the things that we in some of the soft tissue in this area right here and one of the medical names for a spasm in this area is laryngeal spasm and what interesting is if you look up this condition right here hypocalcemia that is low amounts of calcium in your blood one of the symptoms for this is this right here spasm in your larynx interesting that practice what i would always give people is some simple calcium and it really would help them the type of calcium that i would recommend for this condition is calcium lactate i used to use calcium lactate from standard process and you can get that online it inexpensive it works great and it would also believe calcium orotate would work too i haven works good for other types of spasms in the body as well as menstrual cramps and it type of calcium that can penetrate the tissues very well but in practice i always use calcium lactate it very inexpensive you would take two or three an empty stomach each day and that seems to work very very well because what we spasm a muscular contraction another symptom of hypocalcemia is tetany which is a little twitching right here and you could actually have tetany and that can actually affect the um quality of a voice there condition called stridor in infants where an infant very harsh and raspy and take a while guess what causes that hypocalcemia and low vitamin d levels because one of the causes of hypocalcemia is low amounts of vitamin d so it could be that the person is low in calcium because they in vitamin d which probably is actually pretty common so one of the things i would recommend to take on empty stomach is not just the calcium but the vitamin d as well we also know that if someone has gerd even though they have a acid reflux what amount of acid in their stomach it called hypochlorhydria or a chlorhydria which means you have a deficiency of acid or you have no acid and what aren up well if you don what you absorb in the body calcium there vitamin d and low calcium there between viruses certain viruses and calcium too because calcium can help put certain viruses back in remission and too much stress over a period of time can deplete your calcium as well so anyway if you have a lump in the throat try this remedy and comment down below before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you keto and you need a debug because it not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and

Why You Can't Live Without Viruses	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WJg00tcQgI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we can without viruses okay very interesting topic what would happen if all the viruses on this planet right now completely disappeared well guess what within a short period of time this planet would not survive there are quite a few viruses on this planet in fact there individual viruses that is 10 no million viruses that power if you took a look at how large that number is if you took all the stars in the galaxy times 100 million you number of viruses on this planet so there and i 99.9999 of all viruses are not pathogenic they don disease they in the oceans on the lands in the rain forest they and another name for viruses are called phages certain viruses or phages infect bacteria they prevent the bacterial population from exploding if there weren you would have massive amounts of bacteria that would create a whole other series of problems without viruses you wouldn get the biodiversity of microbial life viruses help to ensure oxygen producing phytoplankton get nutrients so 50 of all the oxygen on this planet comes from phytoplankton from the oceans so without viruses we wouldn help build our acquired immunity we have the innate immunity and then we also have the acquired which actually is created through a learning experience of being exposed and dealing with viruses and also did you know that our own dna has over a hundred thousand pieces of viral dna so viruses have intermingled with our own dna for a very very long time viruses are a part of our microbiome so the whole purpose of a virus is to survive it doesn necessarily want to kill the host right away it wants to survive it wants to figure out the strategies of our body trying to kill it and adapt to survival mechanisms itself so viruses are constantly evolving adapting and becoming less deadly over time let i think it existed in 1918 as the spanish flu now that killed 50 million people worldwide but that virus is still around to some degree nowadays but it as it was back then because viruses over time become less deadly and so viruses have a good side and they have a bad side but the solution the best solution for viruses is to keep your own immune system extremely strong and if you done a lot of videos on this vitamin d is very very important zinc is vital vitamin c is also very important i put a link down below to help you understand how to create a healthy immune system and what you can do right now thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you keto and you need a debug because it not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success

5 Reasons for Cold Intolerance Â Nutritional Deficiencies & Feeling Cold Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cADeKDW65g	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let for cold intolerance so there people that have cold sensitivity and they always cold so let nutrition connection first one is if you are deficient in iodine selenium or zinc all three of these trace minerals are intimately involved in supporting thyroid function iodine is needed as part of the thyroid hormone itself so when you have like t4 or t3 the three and the four represent the number of iodine molecules as a part of that hormone selenium is needed in an essential way to convert the inactive thyroid hormone to the active thyroid hormone which is t3 so we need selenium to do this conversion we also need zinc to convert as well and so if you of these trace minerals that could be one reason why you all right number two low iron as in anemia or it could be also anemia coming from low b12 people that have anemia are cold and so the best source of iron would be not spinach but red meat okay and by the way the best source of these trace minerals are shellfish now iron is also needed in the metabolism of brown fat which by the way has a primary function of thermoregulation interesting number three if you have raynaud syndrome where your fingers literally get blue when you come in contact with cold that could stem from a vitamin b1 deficiency because vitamin b1 is involved in the autonomic nervous system which helps to push blood through the body and so if you have raynaud definitely take b1 and another vitamin that will also help this condition called inositol hexanocotinate all right number four insulin resistance okay if you intermittent fasting and you are you why because you have an underlying insulin resistance situation which could take months to correct chromium is probably one of the most important trace minerals to help keep insulin sensitive and so if you deficient in chromium then insulin is not going to be sensitive so it to have resistance to insulin and you time adapting to burning more fat so chromium a very important trace mineral to help with this right here now at the cellular level we mitochondria where the energy is being produced you have this little factory and you have this chemical pathway called the krebs cycle and if you took biochemistry you know what i chemical change that occurs in that cycle of generating energy involves the b vitamins b1 b2 b3 b5 and b6 so if you the b vitamins you difficult time making cellular energy because the mitochondria can nutritional yeast can definitely increase your overall energy as well as your warmth of your your body all right so there these mainly are related to the nutrient connection thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you know how to begin keto or you debug because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Interesting Cause of Air Hunger (Difficulty Breathing) Â Dr.Berg on Shortness of Breath	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJMzbYmzKA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let air hunger okay i shortness of breath the medical term being dyspnea where you just can now the typical reasons why you might have difficulty breathing would be let obstructive pulmonary disease a problem with the lung because you had a history of smoking or pneumonia or tb and by the way 25 of the population on planet earth have latent tb it infection that goes into remission doesn any symptoms in the majority population but in certain people it will come out of remission when the resistance is low or let health problems or they get older but the majority of people don but it does affect the lungs and did you realize in the year 2018 1.5 million people died of tb all right moving right along anxiety people that have panic attacks or they have anxiety always have a weird breathing pattern their exhalation is very very short compared to their inhalation so they so real simple thing you could do if you have anxiety or a panic attack or you worried is start to slow down your breathing where you very slowly for about five seconds four or five seconds in and then four or five seconds out slowly and you change so you autonomic nervous system pulling yourself out of that flight or fight mode all right number six an allergy seven anemia and even a congested gallbladder issue because it going to back up through the bile ducts and put pressure on your diaphragm and you need your diaphragm to breathe and so these are the i common reasons why people have air hunger but there another reason which is not really well known and it has to do with your ph so you have two conditions you have acidosis and alkalosis in acidosis you get these symptoms headache fatigue tremors sleepiness coughing and here we have shortness of breath so acidosis will definitely cause air hunger in alkalosis we have muscle weakness muscle pain muscle cramping hypocalcemia low calcium in the blood technique which is little twitching you get maybe somewhere in your body and sometimes it could definitely affect the breathing as well but i didn it down there because it common but if you have air hunger and you want to figure out if you too acid to alkaline all you have to do is take some calcium or magnesium or potassium and see if you can start breathing better okay and that could indicate that you now or you can start taking apple cider vinegar or betaine hydrochloride which is an acidifier and if you can start breathing better then we know this could be the cause of that problem now the three things that might cause alkalosis would be you don stomach acid so you have a lot of digestive problems and bloating or high levels of cortisol chronic stress or low potassium will cause alkalosis as far as acidosis goes this usually happens when you have severe liver problems a version of it can occur if you you ketones are more acidic or it could be that you much apple cider vinegar or in my case i started drinking too much kombucha tea and i started to develop acid acidosis so i just simply took some calcium boom it went away and then i just made sure when i drank kombucha tea that i only had a little bit so anyway i just want to increase your awareness and expand all the potential causes of air hunger thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you know how to begin keto or you because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help you	Success
Use These Houseplants to Reduce Carcinogens - OKAY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTT_R1jzrHA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now many of you have plants in your house for various reasons but there are a couple other reasons that can benefit your health in a big way now one way that a plant can help you and i give you more oxygen in your bedroom while you absorb co2 and they give up oxygen and this is why when you walk into a greenhouse you just breathe so much better because there oxygen but there benefit from certain plants that you could take advantage of not only from giving you oxygen but also to reduce carcinogens in the air and those plants are devil dwarf date palms peace lily and eureka palms now what that they almost impossible to destroy even if you don sarcastic but they are survivors they don many different toxic chemicals that they can reduce the concentration in the air that you house one big one is formaldehyde now formaldehyde is a very toxic chemical nowadays it and in i think 2018 they banned at least in the united states the treatment of using formaldehyde in wood but how many of you have wood in your house that was purchased or part of your house before 2018 right formaldehyde is a byproduct of auto exhaust tobacco smoke they even use it in hair treatments the brazilian blowout hair treatment uses formaldehyde the problem with formaldehyde is it carcinogen it causes cancer so anything we can do to lower it is a good thing and having these plants in our environment would be also a good thing as well so formaldehyde would be one benzene this is another toxic chemical a carcinogen that these plants can help absorb and keep your air clean and then you also have xylene which is not a known carcinogen but it can depress your central nervous system other than that it healthy and when dealing with cancer it the concentration of chemicals you exposed to in combination with having a weak immune system and maybe other health conditions that could lead to developing cancer and so you do want to take an aggressive approach in preventing and avoiding cancer with certain foods that you eat that can help dismantle carcinogens plants in your environment that can actually reduce the chemicals in the air as well as strengthening your immune system the immune system has three main functions number one killing pathogens number two helping in wound healing and number three killing cancer	Success
Heat Intolerance Â One Deeper Cause Â Low Vitamin B1 & Heat Intolerance Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNBKd_RhaKY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	last week i talked about cold intolerance this week we talk about heat intolerance what is it what can you do about it well it overheated easily in warmer weather you can either have a situation where you excessively when you really shouldn you in hot weather and when your body is in warmer weather you may feel a little bit weak or dizzy so heat intolerance is a symptom of various conditions one ms number two something called pots postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome what is that that a situation where your autonomic nervous system is not adapting that well so when you standing up you get really dizzy and lightheaded so you have to sit down number three dysautonomia this is a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system which this is one condition of this but you can have a lot of other problems related to this right here but in general the autonomic nervous system helps you adapt to certain things like stress uh temperature so let you just get out of the shower and you get dressed and you break out and sweat that would be one example another example is heat intolerance failure to adapt to warmer environments and number four hyper thyroid conditions so that can create a situation where you intolerant to heat what all four of these conditions have a common thread low vitamin b1 when you increase vitamin b1 you can improve the symptoms of ms not just heat intolerance but fatigue also you can improve symptoms of pots dysautonomia and symptoms of hyperthyroidism i would recommend taking a good amount of this try to find a b complex that natural nutritional yeast is a really good source but you take quite a bit the other nutrient that is beneficial especially for ms is vitamin d3 so that could be another thing that can help you but realize that if you take too much vitamin d you may have lower blood pressure and many times with pots the person has very low blood pressure so taking more vitamin d can drop your blood pressure even lower but vitamin d is great for people with high blood pressure so in summary b1 is very very important the other point i want to mention is the more carbohydrate that you consume the more b1 that you it could be that when you also consume more carbohydrates you have more of the symptom because it worsen the b1 deficiency all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you and you need a debug because it going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Top 3 Natural Ways to Treat Allergies Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoStyi1J4wE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey i like to keep things short and sweet let things that you can do right now to reduce your allergy symptoms now there regulatory cells it they for short what they do is they control the development of autoimmune conditions as well as preventing the development of allergies okay hypersensitivities and there are three things that can strengthen the t regulatory cells first thing is probiotics now anytime you take a probiotic always take a very small amount in the very beginning because sometimes it can stir up an immune reaction so whatever it says to do on the dosage just cut it back if it take just maybe a half a teaspoon take it right before you go to bed because one of the things that can do initially is increase histamines which going to make you tired so if you have a little bit of this probiotic that introduced to your body in a new unit of time sometimes that reaction can make you a little bit more tired and actually you so you take some see how you respond take a little bit more take a little bit more until you get to the correct dosage but probiotics can help reduce allergy symptoms because they improve the t regulatory cells number two this is very powerful fasting doing intermittent fasting on a regular basis and periodic pro long fasting there doing fasting over a period of time and then all of a sudden no longer having allergies that as environmental i on all of these things right here now vitamin d vitamin d very strongly helps the t regulatory cells work better i would recommend taking minimally ten thousand ius per day but it to take twenty thousand ius per day and you can actually see after a couple weeks you less allergies also vitamin d is really good for asthma as well anyway that was a quick video thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you know how to begin keto or you debug because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Asthma, Vitamin D and Remodeling of the Lung	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txUuZFRnQMU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	vitamin d is the absolute most important vitamin for asthma now the symptoms of asthma wheezing shortness of breath chest tightness cough and someone that is always vitamin d deficient and it causes changes in the thickness where the gas exchange occurs in your lung also changes in the mass volume of the lung itself in the composition itself and the smooth muscle and so there that are being altered when you have asthma mainly due to inflammation now the surface area of the lungs if you if you take the lungs and spread it out would be the size of a tennis court extremely large and the length of all the airways if you were to stretch them out it would be about 1500 miles so there surface area and the primary function of the lung is gas exchange you breathing in oxygen and you and at the lining of your lung tissue where it air you have some serious immune protection and it your your immune system has to identify a non-threatening airborne particle that doesn system versus an actual deadly virus or a pathogen and that deal with it appropriately and so with asthma there two areas in the immune system where things are not working that well one is with the t helper cell and then the next thing is with the t regulatory cell both of these immune cells are involved in the coordination of immune reactions and regulating inflammation to make sure there too much inflammation and so when there both of these cells you get inflammation and that really causing the change in thickness the volume the composition and the smooth muscles and so now not only do we not get the gas exchange but we also get a hypersensitivity to various triggers so we get this over reaction in the immune system and so inflammation is easily triggered now the other point i want to make about asthma is that one of the most popular treatment is a bronchocorticosteroid inhaler and that is basically this mist that you put in your lungs it so with asthma we have a problem with the immune system we obviously have the problem with the lung and we have the problem with the hormone cortisol so the good news is vitamin d can start to turn around and remodel in a positive way your lungs it can slow down and stop inflammation and stop the fibrosis that which is the scar tissue and vitamin d also helps reset or normalize the cortisol receptor allowing cortisol to work better in your lungs and not only that but vitamin d is really a hormone and it acts very similar to cortisol it and so if you have asthma and you taking vitamin d you recommend at least 20 000 iu vitamin d3 every single day and you should notice great changes in your ability to breathe and reduce these symptoms right here before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you keto and you need a debug because it not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success

In this video, we diagnose uh something called ADHD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Uh this is really a complete joke based on all subjective findings. There bunch of psychiatrists in a room that vote on this, but check this out. This is how they would uh diagnose a second grader, okay? has trouble getting started on tasks, getting dressed, putting away toys. Ignores directions or delays in following directions. Hard time sitting during meals. Fidgets, talks uh when they quiet. Has trouble stopping one activity to begin another. Struggles to slow down enough to do things carefully. Needs to be reminded a lot to stop and listen. Has a harder time paying attention. Grabs things without permission. is un unable to wait for directions. Has takes too much time to complete tasks. Has trouble remembering directions. Has trouble recalling facts they just learned. Very upset or annoyed over minor frustrations. These are all normal things, normal behaviors for a second grader. And as soon as they label them, that just put them on a drug. This is a great book called The Hyperactivity Hoax by Sydney Walker, MD. Um, I mean, it about keeping kids quiet, stopping them, slow down, stop, wait. I mean, this is going to mess up a kid if we keep stopping them, stopping them, and like this have this quiet child that is supposed is supposed to be normal. Uh, and then here point I want to mention with hyperactivity. Uh, often fidgets with hands and feets and squirms in the seat. often leaves the seat in a classroom and other situations when they to be sitting. I mean, you try to take a a child and put them in a have them sit for long periods of time. It natural to do that. Often runs about and climbs successfully in situations which is inappropriate. Often has difficulty uh playing or engaging in leisure activities quietly. How you going to play with something quietly? That this it acts if driven by a motor. I That criterias. Often talks successfully. What if they these behaviors are normal for a child. And this is the biggest scam, a hoax. These kids, I know their nutrition could be improved. They never look at the diet. They never look at the nutrition. There are minerals in the body and vitamins that slow the motor down. That get a child to be more calm. Okay? If it thing. Get a natural B1 from nutritional yeast. Mix it with even if you have to add a little bit of, you know, low sugar chocolate with peanut butter to get the child to consume it with some nutritional yeast or put it in applesauce. Get the B1 in there. Nutritional yeast. That will chill out the child like that. Of course, got to get them off the sugar. Unfortunately, a lot of parents start the kid on sugar. We don not have sugar in the house. But I have a lot of recipes. I below of all these great foods. If you making these for the kids. They will not know the difference between a low carb treat. It it find a vegetable that they like. do the kale shake and put maybe bananas and fruit in there so they don the kale and have them consume it. That will give them so much potassium. You see the child will have more control of their own body. Um but this out of control situation is purely physical. It preservatives, they could be allergic to something in some chemical. I mean the amount of all the junk food has MSG. It in the vegetables. So that minerals are uh breaks on the nervous system. They calm the nervous system. I will guarantee doing this simple thing will probably handle near 100% of these kids with this this so-called disorder. Okay, put your comments below. Hi guys. Hey, listen. And I created a a pretty amazing evaluation quiz down below that actually analyzes your symptoms to find the cause, the root cause of all of your symptoms, the most likely cause. So take the quiz now and we	Success

Migraine Headaches and Caffeine Â Migraine Headache Relief Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O8Ltw8bqIk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	i wanted to create a short video on another trigger to migraines when i was in practice i saw this all the time there were people that had headaches that are drinking a lot of coffee and they didn so i wanted to include the list just to make sure that you caffeine is definitely a trigger to migraines 87 of americans drink coffee with an average amount of caffeine of 164 milligrams every single day and there interesting study that i down below that demonstrates two or more caffeinated beverages per day can trigger migraines three to four servings of caffeinated beverages will increase it by 1.5 times and 5 servings of a caffeinated beverage will increase your chance of getting migraine by 2x now when we talk about migraines it a very complex topic because no one really knows exactly what causes migraines they have theories we do know the triggers can be weather could be sleep stress low blood sugars loud noises bright lights but from working with quite a few people over many years i narrowed down some really good remedies to help people with headaches i one at the top decrease caffeine i would actually completely eliminate caffeine from your diet and you to find that after about two weeks when there you may find your migraines are completely gone all right number two a magnesium deficiency can actually set you up for migraines so take more magnesium number three if you don this a ketogenic diet will usually greatly reduce if not completely eliminate migraines simply because your brain loves ketones and when you make the switch all sorts of wonderful things happen to your brain so get on a ketogenic diet low carb if you down below number four if you have low sodium that can trigger a migraine i did an entire video on that one topic i put the link down below check it out and so with this i would recommend taking like about eighth of a teaspoon of salt dissolve it in some water and drink that several times a day that seems to work really nicely especially if you have a pattern of migraines that happen every so often and you can predict when they come you can drink this salt water before it occurs and hopefully suppress a migraine number five is very very common so many people have gallbladder issues and there from the diaphragm right on top of where the gallbladder is that goes all the way up to your neck and it can refer pain up into the head on the right side so if your migraine is on the right side or you have headaches on the right side suspect gallbladder and you need to obviously change your diet but one real simple cool thing you can do is just massage the gallbladder underneath your right rib cage it and congested and just notice if your headache or migraine goes away in which case if it does then we know there connection and now you need to watch the videos that i have on the gallbladder i but it anything on the right side shoulder arm the whole thing check the gallbladder number six if you get migraines that time of the month it to estrogen your estrogen dominance so there a link down below you probably need to take some iodine or seek help better yet or something called dim which is a concentrated cruciferous type product that can help regulate excessive amounts of estrogen all right there you have it this is the complete list thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you know how to begin keto or you because it as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
I Can't Last 3 Hours Without Food	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geydnuSgv5c	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so i keep eating this question over and over and over i just wanted to create a video to explain it okay and the question is this why can before i am starving i some food so this is a problem of fasting you just can and what this means is you have a serious blood sugar problem an average thin person is carrying around about a hundred thousand calories of fat on their bodies yet we only have a very small amount of stored sugar it it so we have about only 1700 calories of stored sugar and a tremendous amount of stored fat so the problem is we into this fat because we have a blood sugar problem we have what what is that well that is a situation where your pancreas is pumping out a lot of insulin and the receptor won because it and so then we don communication back here because this is blocked so then the pancreas just produces more and more and more and more insulin so we have high levels of insulin when we have insulin resistance and it the high level of insulin that prevents someone from tapping into the fat what allows you to tap into the fat and make this transition is low levels of insulin and so the question is how do you get someone to fast for a longer period of time so they and craving all the time very very simple once you understand this you must rid 100 of the sugars and the hidden sugars fruit includes dates mango especially apples you can have some berries but not any of the sweeter fruits yogurt which has a good amount of sugar in it especially if it sweetened but even the plain has sugar in it juice yes that has that equivalent to soda honey is very similar to regular sugar it will prevent you from tapping in the fat so doing the keto program partially doesn the sugars way down in order for you to really get over here and start running off of your fat and then what happens you can go longer because you won and you won definitely want to make sure and this is very important that you don even on keto have this idea i can just have a little snack in between the meal like even if it healthy snack let some nuts or something like that what gonna happen that little bit of snack is going to make you hungry about an hour to two to three hours later you because eating makes you hungry why because it stimulates insulin even if you consume protein it stimulate some degree of insulin and then insulin will push the blood sugars down and you end up with a blood sugar problem so no more snacking number three just add more fat at the end of the meal if we take a look at a meal the first thing that i like to do is have my vegetable first my salad second thing with the protein which usually has fat in it and then the last thing is maybe some additional fat whether it peanut butter or whatever because if you actually add more fat to the meal it and fasting longer is going to help you transition over here too so we have a combination of lowering your carbs and sugar and fasting longer both of those things will help you drop insulin and everything is going to work really nicely the last thing that i would do is add more fiber in the form of vegetable salad why because you can take care of it for you they can digest the fiber they turn it into various chemicals that actually help your blood sugars there actually comes from a microbe consuming the fiber and that butyrate actually helps insulin resistance it if you vegetables that could be a problem in the transition especially if you have a history of blood sugar issues and insulin resistance so after you do this you longer and a lot of things are going to get better but realize this the longer you a blood sugar problem and insulin resistance the more difficult it make the transition and the longer you do this to see really good amazing results before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you and you need a debug because it going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success

Secondhand Smoke Kills 600,000 People Per Year	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY7rApx8cNc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	did you realize that 600 000 people die every single year of passive smoke or secondhand smoke i mean they just around smokers 41 000 people die in the u.s alone and so there seven thousand people that die of actual lung cancer and the rest almost 34 000 die of heart disease so the smoke doesn just destroy the lung it destroys the inside of your arteries around the heart and this cigarette exposure comes from the smoke that comes off the cigarette and so the secondhand smoke comes from the cigarette itself and from the smoke coming from the mouth of the person smoking the cigarette and so if we compare this to people who actually smoke there worldwide that die from smoking and there 000 of those deaths from the u.s alone about 10 times the amount of people who die from second-hand smoke you see in my mind i thought that secondhand smoke was not that dangerous and as long as you didn good but apparently i was wrong and the reason why i is because i recently learned that the highest type of cancer worldwide is lung cancer and the highest rate of cancer deaths actually involve the lung and so the lung is at the top of the list and smoking is a major contributing factor there are over 7 000 chemicals in cigarette smoke hundreds that are toxic and seventy that are carcinogens chemicals that can cause cancer some of the most deadly carcinogens are number one pah number two n nitrosamines then we have aromatic amines benzene aldehydes and ethylene oxide so if you smokers if you live with a smoker just do whatever you can to make sure they smoke outside or not around you and if you this might be a good reason to do whatever you can to quit all right guys talk to you later before you go if you have a question about a product or you know how to begin keto or you debug because it i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Allergies Can Be Created Before Birth - OKAY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWkn9Thkcac	Dr. Eric Berg DC	this is interesting allergies can actually start pre-birth that children will develop allergies it quite common and i think by understanding when allergies develop one can then do things to prevent allergies but there that can go wrong when a baby is in the womb the number one trigger for allergies even more than a nutritional deficiency is maternal stress they call it prenatal programming which has to do with something called epigenetics which is your environment if there environment because the mother is stressed out it translates to the baby directly so if the mother has high levels of cortisol that child will also develop high cortisol and so there been a lot of research into this area showing the relationship between maternal stress and high levels of something called ige which is kind of an immune reaction that allergies so number one it important for a mother to have a stress-free environment as much as possible now there that occur in the womb you have nutritional deficiencies which can also set that child up for all sorts of problems for their entire life including allergies so it woman consume enough b vitamins especially vitamin b1 vitamin d dha zinc iodine there the most important now the question is if you you one simple way would be to see if there that you have do you have any cravings that nutritional deficiencies now during the birthing process if you have c-sections kids have a much greater risk of developing allergies probably due to the lack of friendly bacteria if you breastfeed your child the risk of allergies go way way down mothers that are in a situation where they have to give the child formula give a much greater risk of that child developing allergies and so if you breastfeeding what the mother consumes dietarily as well as the nutrients are crucial and making sure that that milk is fortified and healthy and strengthens a healthy immune system in fact you want to breastfeed as long as possible a couple years would be great and i about fully breastfeeding but at least maybe partial breastfeeding and as well as food and then if the child is not breastfeeding and they formula you got to be careful because they have all sorts of low quality type ingredients in those formulas not to mention sugar so you want to find something that to make note of prenatals i would never recommend taking a synthetic prenatal it vitamins i would recommend taking a whole food based multivitamin multi-trace mineral product i would also recommend cod liver oil very very important because that has the omega-3 fatty acids epa dha as well as vitamin a and vitamin d i would take extra vitamin d because it vitamin d number one and number two if you going to be deficient in vitamin d so breastfeeding doesn give you enough vitamin d and vitamin d is essential in preventing structural problems in that child potentially avoiding scoliosis flat feet and even dental malformations of your jaw so you could potentially avoid a lot of problems like having braces as a child gets older also the b vitamins are very very important in a lot of different aspects so make sure that you b vitamins i recommend in the form of nutritional yeast so they synthetic so you can see that pre-birth during the birth and post-birth are all very important periods of time that you can do things to help prevent a lot of health problems if you deliver a baby and you start having symptoms postpartum depression for example all that means is you are deficient in certain nutrients usually vitamin d or it could be b1 and as soon as you take that nutrient it goes away one last point i want to talk about is something called hygiene hypothesis there this theory that i think is true and it has to do with how clean the environment is there growing up in a sterilized environment and having the child develop all sorts of issues especially allergies because they don environmental stimulus which is in microbes in the environment even viruses necessary for the development of a strong immune system our immune system is created from getting infections and so if we completely sterilize the environment and don in the dirt they end up developing a weakness in the immune system and for those people that are a little bit more educated in uh the medical area i about balancing the th1 which is the t helper cell one to the t helper cell 2 ratio i don want to get into that in the video but having that good strong balance um can help protect you in life and that is all created from being exposed to environmental things like bacteria and viruses and fungus and having our body develop our immune system it immune system we the innate immune system which our mother gave us but then we develop another part of our immune system called the acquired immune system and to do that you have to live in an environment that absolutely clean all the time anyway enough said on that thanks for watching i will see you in the next video	Success
B3 (Niacin) and Schizophrenia	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwGHf22kHmE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let schizophrenia now there fascinating information on this topic schizophrenia is a combination of having hallucinations delusions paranoia mixed with feeling disconnected loss of interest in life and feeling emotion list which basically is your apathetic now the medical theory of what causes schizophrenia is you have dopamine excess and so you certain drugs to help regulate that the problem with those drugs is it has certain side effects that cause metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance which has been shown to worsen these symptoms because of what it does to the brain so as a side note there links down below of how ketones going on the ketogenic diet can help reduce those symptoms but that video it there was a doctor named Dr Abraham Hofer some years ago who had a different Theory and that theory was called the adrenal Chrome Theory adrenal Chrome is basically the byproducts of adrenaline and in his research he found that the chemical structure of adrenaline was very similar to LSD and so it had certain types of effects on the brain if it was in higher amounts so his whole theory was that schizophrenia comes from excessive amounts of adrenal Chrome in the brain which is toxic now normally you clears that chemical out and people with schizophrenia have a defect with this enzyme so he found that by taking large doses of B3 and I straight niin I time relase niin the one that doesn give you the flush um there effects with that one rather rather than just take straight B3 niin but anyway he found that by taking large doses of niin you can prevent the conversion of the precursor for adrenaline called noradrenaline thereby making less adrenaline so it will help clear out adrenaline it helps you produce less adrenaline which can be toxic to the brain especially if you have a defect to this enzyme but also B3 will reduce liver toxicity it reduce oxidative stress in your mitochondria as well as help your DNA repair there were several double blonded studies that were done one of the studies showed a 79.5% Improvement in symptoms now he died some years ago but recently there were some other additional studies that were done to show improvements with schizophrenia using high doses of not just B3 but other B vitamins as well I before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you because it a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the US hopefully in the future we to answer everyone number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Best Remedy for Excess Sweating (Hyperhidrosis)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Thtf50La8o	Dr. Eric Berg DC	all right i had a quick video for you on the best remedy for hyperhidrosis which is excessive sweating and that is sage it supplement as well it supports something called vagal tone what is vagal term well the vagus nerve is a very long nerve extends from your brain stem down through all the organs of your body and it called the parasympathetic so vagal tone has to do with the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system and excessive sweating is a problem with the opposite part of that system called the sympathetic nervous system in fact one of the treatments which i think is barbaric that is being done or definitely has been i don to cut the sympathetic nerve in certain places in the body to stop excessive amounts of sweating and so as a natural non-toxic way to address excessive sweating you may want to start trying sage out it may help you they have them in 100 milligram tablets and i would take probably two or three of those every single day until you experience relief and then play around with the dosage after that to see what you have to do to maintain it there menopausal relief as in night sweats also benefits to your cognitive function better concentration more alert better focus better memory if you have excess of saliva this would be a good remedy as well it depression bloating gas and it has antibacterial properties so if you have this condition you might want to check this out before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you and you need a debug because it going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we answer everyone but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help	Success

At the 1st Sign of a Stroke: DO THIS...	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_XOUs4IkNo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so at the first sign of a stroke what should someone do let family member and you notice a potential sign of a stroke what should you do first let about what are the signs of a stroke you have numbness in one side of your body it could be the face it could be even an arm or a leg confusion loss of facial function loss of arm function on one side loss of leg function slurred speech trouble walking there to remember some key factors and it stands for fast so the face okay so if you have the person next to you that you suspect they just had a stroke have them smile okay and if one side of their face droops that could be an indicator because you lose facial function on one side the next factor is the arm have them raise both of their arms and if one side just drops down that could be an indication of a stroke the next point is have them speak you ask them to repeat a phrase a few times and see if they can do it if they start slurring that can be a sign of a stroke now realize there to get this person to the hospital so they can actually give them some type of anti-clotting medication to open up the clot into the brain so the brain can get oxygen it window so you want to probably call now just as 911 as knowing what to do if someone actually is having a stroke it most important thing is getting your diet corrected so your insulin is normalized so you don insulin because then you develop insulin resistance and when you have that you have a lot of blood sugar issues and you can form a clot just with that condition right up the bat so you want to do a low carb healthy diet also you want to do a diet rich in potassium a lot of leafy greens would be very important potassium helps support the vascular system and it can also inhibit clotting vitamin e specifically the tocopherols are probably one of the best antioxidants to support the brain and free radical damage because what unique about the brain is that there oxygen consumption so you have a lot of free radicals and oxidants going on so you need a good antioxidant vitamin e the tocopherol version is the best number four ketones so if you ketogenic diet if you exogenous ketones all support the brain the brain loves ketones better than glucose and ketones are kind of the opposite fuel to glucose glucose tends to create more clots ketones can inhibit clots also fasting intermittent fasting is very very beneficial to the brain and also causing your body to recycle old damaged protein and so one of the most important things to support both your cardiovascular system the inside of the lining of your arteries and the brain is intermittent fasting all sorts of magical things happen then we have dha which is omega-3 fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids not only thin the blood as does vitamin e but it also can help repair brain damage and protect the brain against clotting garlic is a good blood thinner then we have exercise which is going to support more oxygen to the brain cells one last therapy which i have done and i love is is the hyperbaric oxygen therapy you should look into it if you haven about it and it can create some serious improvement if you actually had a stroke and you into the brain to repair it hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it want you to take it and here here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today	Success

Symptom vs. Sign: What is the Difference? - OKAY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik7AJqZ_qUM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so i and i the questions that you have in the comments and this video is on the difference between a symptom and a sign okay now a symptom is very subjective it themselves like pain fatigue anxiety depression a headache those symptoms are not objective you can feeling that or not it patient says okay that would be a symptom all right now a sign is more objective it can be measured by another it physical response or reaction to something so like a rash acne you can see it it can be measured coughing okay that high blood pressure you can measure that a fever you can measure that testing positive for cancer that can be measured doing a blood test finding out there low iron so you have a stethoscope to listen to the heart to see if there arrhythmia problem with the heart an x-ray to indicate a fracture or a blood pressure cuff to see if there symptom subjective sign objective and they both are contributing to a syndrome a disorder or a disease okay now a syndrome is a group of symptoms which are common together now a disorder is a disturbance in normal function so that would be something like major depressive disorder which is interesting about depression because it there that they do for depression but of course they tend to make that into a disease they might say major depressive disease or major depressive disorder depending on what they to be using and then we have something called a disease and that that has a specific cause and it has symptoms right here a lot of times they into diseases so it gets really really confusing and so but the medical fashion is really good at classification of symptoms there to define one is iotrogenic disease and that is a disease that is caused by the medical profession and what interesting about that is iotrogenic diseases are the third cause of death and then we have the last term idiopathic sounds very scientific you have an idiopathic disease that means unknown cause we don what caused it and what about that is the great majority of diseases out there are idiopathic another term for idiopathic would be essential so you have essential hypertension for example that would be hypertension that they don causes it that you also have essential tremors okay they don anyway i wanted just to define these words create a video and give you some clarity	Success
How to Get Rid of Hiccups	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1AvkBv1zR8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so how do you get rid of a hiccup well first of all what is a hiccup a hiccup is a problem with your diaphragm the diaphragm is a muscle that helps you breathe so it contracts and relaxes so what happens with a hiccup is you getting an intermittent contraction and it controlling it there are certain sensors that are in that diaphragm there receptors for carbon dioxide and there neurological receptors too so if you or co2 or the nerves it can cause a short circuiting and that can lead to a hiccup and it can be triggered by excitement fear like you eating too fast and i many other things so the question is what can you do well number one hiccup on purpose now what does that mean think about it normally a hiccup is involuntary so if you voluntarily try to hiccup you you so what the diaphragm under your control again so it mean this technique also sometimes can work for resting tremors which is involuntary as well so if you could try to make your uh hand go back and forth on purpose sometimes that can actually get rid of the the the tremor this also works for if you stutter okay if you try to stutter on purpose it tends to get rid of the stuttering so you can apply this to the hiccups as well you can actually start to slow down your breath and just calm things down so you want to breathe in like four seconds slowly and you breathe in and then breathe out four seconds and go back and forth because what happening is the autonomic nervous system is now functioning so you are again causing your autonomic nervous system to do certain things and this can help reset things so to speak number three and you probably already know this you can drink a glass of water from the opposite side so that can help as well and the last thing is you just want to calm down because it get hiccups when they calm and when they ahead and try this and let me know if it works hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it want you to take it and here here is your environment is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today	Success
Shrink Your Enlarged Prostate	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvhs40xmGTA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so let enlarged prostate that could potentially affect your urination now it is true that when men age their prostate actually does enlarge and take a look at where the prostate is located it little tube that urinary bladder so as you increase the size of that prostate it tube and it urinate and so the doctor puts you on a certain medication like flomax an antibiotic and maybe you then i but my question is what is causing the enlarged prostate if you take a look at all of your hormones they can be classified really in two different categories one category is called anabolic and the other category would be catabolic now anabolic has everything to do with building something up and catabolic is breaking something down so when you eat food you have this catabolic effect all these enzymes that break down food into their basic building blocks amino acids fatty acids glucose etc and then you have all the anabolic hormones that kick in and take these building blocks and make body tissue out of them and so when the prostate enlarges it thing going on right if we take a look at all the anabolic hormones we have prolactin which and maybe you prolactin with women in breastfeeding but men also have prolactin and if the prolactin is too high it can definitely increase the size of the prostate and then estrogen itself can increase the size of the prostate and estrogen also increases the release of prolactin so then you have other hormones like dht which is a very powerful form of testosterone and androgens cortisol growth hormone igf number one which is kind of the extension of growth hormone it by growth hormone definitely will increase the prostate and you have progesterone and insulin which is a very powerful anabolic hormone and so let look here what food or thing has the majority of these hormones that you might be consuming on a regular basis milk milk is a very powerful anabolic substance that is turned into cheese yogurt kefir and milk contains the majority of these anabolic hormones and so if you have urination problems or your prostate is enlarged you need to get off milk and milk products 100 percent okay that one now number two is insulin what triggers insulin sugar a high carb diet so if your prostate is enlarged or you have urination problems you need to get off sugar and go on a ketogenic plan if you to my channel i put a link down below and then we have estrogen okay so estrogen can come from many different sources soy is a big source of estrogen so if you soy milk or soy protein isolates as a protein and maybe a diet shake that you or you you just have commercial vegetables or commercial foods which have a lot of chemicals that mimic estrogen that could be one big factor that increasing the size of your prostate now a lot of times people take natural remedies for the prostate like salt palmetto and because salt palmetto inhibits a certain enzyme that is normally converting testosterone into a very powerful form of testosterone called dht which can increase the prostate but here if you consuming a lot of milk products eating on sugar potentially consuming some soy it cut out the dairy get on a keto plan make sure you don that can stimulate estrogen in addition to that take some salt palmetto green tea is a great inhibitor of this enzyme so are pumpkin seeds zinc and lycopene now lycopene also has some great research that can help shrink the prostate and that would be high in tomatoes so tomatoes would be a good food to consume if you have an enlarged prostate so if you diet to someone with an enlarged prostate not only healthy keto and intermittent fasting but i would also consume more cruciferous vegetables especially kale because that your estrogen and even beats hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it and here here environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today	Success
The 2 Types of Strokes	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQimdvyrs80	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let strokes i have done other videos and strokes but i primarily talked about this first one which involves a clot where you have a blocked artery and then you part of your brain or the part of your body and so that part of your body gets starved of oxygen and nutrition and it starts to malfunction here are some of the warning signs weakness or numbness on one side of your body difficulty speaking difficulty seeing dizzy and headache now that would be a symptom for both versions of a stroke but what i want to discuss is the other type of stroke and that stroke where you bleeding because a blood vessel bursts in your brain and it of all strokes that could come from an aneurysm which is kind of a bulging of the artery that can then burst or it can also come from a congenital situation called the arterial venous malformation which is a genetic condition now the biggest risk factor for getting this type of stroke would be having high blood pressure so what i is how can someone reduce blood pressure naturally and also decrease the risk for an aneurysm from a nutritional standpoint first let there someone with high blood pressure needs to know start doing a low carb diet why because when you do high carbs you get inflammation and the arteries actually become stiffened and your blood pressure goes up so this is very very important if you my channel i put a link down below consuming foods with a lot of potassium taking enough potassium in general can reduce your risk for a stroke okay potassium and i eating a bunch of bananas i about getting it from a lot of leafy greens a person needs at least seven cups of leafy greens a day to get even close to their potassium requirements but potassium is a physiological relaxer it actually can help lower blood pressure and get rid of excessive fluid very important we need 4 700 milligrams a day rarely does anyone even get close vitamin d will bring your blood pressure down most people are deficient in vitamin d and when they take enough vitamin d at least 10 000 ius probably 20 000 would be better they going to notice their blood pressure go down when wouldn when your blood pressure is too low if you have extremely low blood pressure and you take too much vitamin d that can lower it some more now your low blood pressure could also come from not enough salt too so that could be the root cause of that regular exercise keeps your arteries very very elastic so you want to keep exercising as long as you possibly can and omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil cod liver oil essential for reducing inflammation preventing the stiffening and hardening of your arteries now an aneurysm okay is a little bulge on the artery wall okay that can burst and there right here and it so the question is what could cause an aneurysm to bulge like this it within the artery wall two things strengthen the artery wall the most important one is vitamin c vitamin c from nature comes in a complex with a lot of different things it just ascorbic acid sometimes when you go buy a vitamin c supplement and the back label says ascorbic acid that get that one little tiny part of the vitamin c complex and bioflavonoids is one part that in strengthening this wall of your artery i would recommend always getting a food-based vitamin especially if you very very important in keeping the arteries nice and strong but not too stiff and if you have enough k2 that will lower your chance of getting calcium buildup as well so for aneurysm it vitamin c foods and k2 one last point that i just recalled and that would be this if your carbohydrates are too high if you you will not be able to absorb vitamin c why because the chemistry of vitamin c is very similar to glucose so your body will take the glucose before vitamin c so it comes back to this low-carb diet very very important and necessary all right thanks for watching	Success
What Emotion Triggers Adrenaline?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4RGr_K4RM4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	what emotion triggers adrenaline can you guess fear fear triggers adrenaline so does exercise excitement physical threat and hypoglycemia low blood sugar can all trigger adrenaline now let take a look at what adrenaline does it increases your heart rate sweating vasodilation of both the lung tissue so you can breathe better as well as the heart the coronary artery vasodilates when there oxygen and blood to the heart muscle tissue this is one of the reasons why you probably have seen movies where they injected someone into the heart with adrenaline to revive them adrenaline makes your body stronger more alert because it mechanism you right it releases glucose from your liver and your muscles for quick energy and it triggers this other hormone right here which relates to something called the hpa axis the hypothalamus pituitary and adrenal axis this is a little different mechanism where you is the other stress hormone so both adrenaline and cortisol are preparing the body for a stress state the difference is adrenaline is is what within seconds cortisol takes a few minutes to kick in cortisol is more long-lasting adrenaline is more short-lived now i was in wrestling i wrestled in 9th grade 10th grade 11th grade 12th grade in the first year of college until i fractured my neck but in high school i wrestled at 185 pounds which by the way that weight right now but there above this which is heavyweight so when we had a meet i would literally have to wait for all these wrestlers to wrestle before it was my opportunity and so there was a lot of excitement there was a lot of fear going on i remember trying to relax and rest underneath the bleachers before the match because i literally had to wait probably i don and a half before i wrestled and so i was laying there and i felt my heart rate beating through my chest just boom boom boom boom i was sweating i had a lot of energy flowing through my body so i was not about to take a nap i was not about to feel calm i was basically in an adrenaline mode for about an hour and a half and so what happened that drained my energy so by the time i was ready to wrestle i was completely exhausted but somehow i pushed through it so short-term adrenal is good chronic exposure to too much adrenaline is very very bad because it burns you out it can burn out the adrenals it can affect the heart it can affect your mood you can actually have a lower tolerance for stress it can actually prevent you from going into a relaxing sleep if there much adrenaline flowing through your body here adrenaline is made by the inside of your adrenals called the adrenal medulla and this adrenaline which is a neurotransmitter it it travels through the nervous system is part of the sympathetic nervous system it like the on switch to stress the off switch which is called the parasympathetic is not in the adrenals so the unique thing about the adrenals it 100 sympathetic nervous system and there innervation in the inside of the adrenal in other words there and so if you chronically stimulate the adrenals with any of these over a period of time the adrenals tend to stay on and they don and so here you are you can can you feel stress all the time and then that and then you get belly fat so the question is what can you do about it this is really not a nutritional problem this is a stress problem so you need to disconnect from the stress or somehow handle the stress whatever that stress is if it or a person you need to handle that that includes turning off the tv so you watching the news every night changing your environment sleeping more there nutritional things you can do to help but without handling this right here these really won create a big impact but vitamin b1 is at the top of the list if you take b1 or nutritional yeast you feel a sense of relief vitamin d vitally important and vitamin c because your adrenals need vitamin c both adrenaline and cortisol without vitamin c your adrenal glands do not work but let me come back to this little point right here hypoglycemia and what causes hypoglycemia what has the capacity to push your blood sugars down and the answer to that is insulin and what triggers that you guessed it a high carbohydrate diet being on a high carbohydrate diet keeps your body in flight or fight mode activating adrenaline and creating a situation where it hard to lose weight so just by changing your diet going on a low carb diet guess what can happen you can help to restore normal levels of adrenaline and this is why when people do the keto diet they feel calmer they feel less stressed if you i put a link down below of exactly what you should be eating hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it and here here environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i

Why a Decreased Appetite With These Diseases? IMPORTANT - OKAY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHUaV-k6CFs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let certain diseases i on appetite relating to the ketogenic diet and shifting from sugar burning to fat burning but today we about a different area of appetite and the medical terminology for decreased appetite actually is anorexia now you might say no that well an eating disorder would be anorexia nervosa but in this context we appetite in certain disease states now why would the body turn off appetite when someone has viral hepatitis or addison disease which is a adrenal failure or aids or cancer or cilia crohn ulcerative colitis or common cold or fever or with mental disorders or when you have the stomach flu or tb or when you have an infection or post surgery which is not a disease but i just wanted to add it in there or psychological stress why would the body shut down the appetite with these you may consider it just another symptom that somehow there but in reality it beneficial thing to lose your appetite so you can fast when you fast you allow the body to finally recover repair heal and clear damage when you do fasting you actually create a new immune system wouldn wouldn virus infection or wouldn some infection from a fever or stomach flu or tb or infection going through a fast drops inflammation look at this we have addison autoimmune you have a lot of inflammation in all the autoimmune conditions what about post-surgery you inflammation right not eating will help reduce inflammation and what about all the digestive issues you have inflammation in celiac crohn ulcerative colitis not to mention when you fast you clean out your entire gut so these can finally heal now fasting also improves your cognitive function as well as your mood it brings people in a higher emotional state on the emotional level just by fasting so when you lose your appetite when you get sick or have a disease donate just fast it help you recover and it it a decreased appetite too and they can relate to nutritional deficiencies low vitamin b1 low b12 low zinc and low magnesium can all create a decrease in appetite so unless you get the understanding behind the fasting you can mistakenly think wow i need to keep eating and that can actually slow down your healing if you have a certain infection or a disease thanks for watching	Success
Loss of Smell (Anosmia): THE Solution	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrYW6QS-tQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let you have several situations you could have a total loss of smell a distorted sense of smell or a reduced ability to smell smells and this could happen from an infection like virus from the covid an injury an allergy and there could be other causes as well now the key trace mineral for smell in general is zinc if you lose your smell and i you take the zinc and you still have a problem what can you do well let what olfactory nerve but really it olfactory bulb which is just brain tissue inside your head behind your sinuses and it processes everything connected with the perception of smell so you have receptors in your sinuses you have quite a few you have like 10 million receptors in each sinus that pick up information and drive it into the brain into the olfactory bulb where it injury a viral infection or an allergy that can alter this to a certain degree what can you do well there things you can do i would definitely recommend taking zinc that may not handle 100 percent but vitamin b1 a special type of b1 it works very well for all types of neuropathy including peripheral neuropathy from either diabetes or chemotherapy there condition called wernicki course cough syndrome and that comes usually from drinking a lot of alcohol where you deplete your b1 one of the symptoms is loss of smell so this is something i would highly recommend taking and you can take four capsules per day and just i brands you can research that in addition to that i would take alpha lipoic acid both of these work very well together to help support any type of neuropathy problem so if you have a loss of smell go ahead and try this combination and comment down below hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it and here here environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today	Success
Foods that Can Prevent a Miscarriage	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq6cNVZqZYA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let potentially prevent or avoid a miscarriage there are no studies on this even prenatals apparently don a miscarriage i think the reason for that is that if your diet isn going into a pregnancy and you throwing on top of it some synthetic vitamins and high potency amounts it the big impact the most important thing is making sure that mother has prepared a healthy body for that baby and that means consuming the right foods well in advance so if we look at some of the data relating to miscarriages eighty percent of miscarriages happen within the first trimester there could be some dna or genetic problem that gets activated from epigenetics epigenetics actually control your genes and so if the mother severe trauma or stress or something in the environment that expresses the wrong gene then there could be problems so your epigenetic environment is actually more important than your genes the fetus could be growing on the outside of the uterus that could be one reason there could be an infection there could be some type of chronic health problem like diabetes and autoimmune disease high blood pressure fibroids so there fetus to grow smoking can definitely be a big problem alcohol can be another big problem being on certain type of drugs can cause this problem high amounts of caffeine can cause a miscarriage seizures problems with the cord mercury chemicals solvents pesticides and several of these things could be a nutritional deficiency combined with being on the wrong diet if we take a low-carb diet you becoming a diabetic and especially if you developing something called gestational diabetes which is actually not so rare and that that pregnant female is consuming way too many carbohydrates now by also lowering your carbohydrates you inflammation okay so you condition right here blood pressure can be controlled by consuming high potassium foods that would be large amounts of salads leafy greens as well as magnesium same thing leafy greens and vitamin d it your vitamin d from food you can get some from fatty fish like salmon or the sun but i highly recommend that if you now to start taking at least 10 000 ius of vitamin d now also when you smoke you deplete vitamin c you get vitamin c from consuming enough vegetables definitely bell peppers red peppers all type of peppers now fibroids actually can be stimulated by consuming too much dairy especially because there type of hormones and dairy that can make the fibroids get bigger and then we have alcohol which depletes vitamin b1 and that can create a whole series of issues and then down here we have mercury chemicals pesticides heavy metals if you stick with organic foods you going to reduce the amount of chemicals and pesticides in the foods it important when that baby is developing that all the nutrients are there and so instead of taking a synthetic prenatal i would always recommend a food based prenatal find a high quality one in addition to consuming the key foods that are high in that individual vitamin like folic acid you can get that from dark leafy green vegetables vitamin d you can get that from sun cod liver oil vitamin c vegetables bell peppers red peppers vitamin e seeds like in sunflower seeds and nuts almonds walnuts pecans omega-3 fatty acids which is very very important i primarily which supports the the brain fatty fish okay salmon huge now there is some mercury in salmon and other fish but it just so happens that the fish are also loaded with selenium that counters that and so that brings up trace minerals selenium is a trace mineral trace minerals are very very important in the development of that baby so you can get that from seafood or sea kelp talking about iodine zinc selenium and many others a vitamin b3 deficiency can really increase your risk for getting a miscarriage it from turkey tuna chicken beef it but you may want to take this as an extra supplement and the best amino acids to take if you would be eggs and fish there proteins that are good too but these are very usable by your body to give the growing baby everything that it needs to develop correctly but here really really important fats it low-fat diet when you you want grass-fed butter okay on your food this will give you vitamin k2 that very very important olives olive oil cod liver oil very very important but these are some of the foods that i would recommend to potentially avoid a miscarriage and make sure that baby develops in a very healthy way and if a mother could actually start eating healthy like one to two years before the pregnancy i think that could completely avoid miscarriage unless there is some genetic problem that you cannot fix and if you watching this go ahead and radically change your diet to including some of these nutrients and of course it avoiding certain things like the junk foods the high level of carbohydrates the refined carbs and sugars all right thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it want you to take it and here here is your environment

A Fever is Beneficial and a Normal Response Â Benefits of Fever Explained by Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhDj0uORiQ4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	i people get a fever they automatically want to get rid of this fever and that is a big mistake now let basics the normal temperature of your body should be between 97.8 to 99 degrees fahrenheit or that degrees celsius to 37.2 degrees celsius and this can vary a little bit depending on your age if you female etc now babies and children generally have a higher temperature it normal for a newborn baby to have a temperature of 99.5 fahrenheit or 37.5 celsius and as we age we actually get cooler someone in their 80s could have a temperature of 93.5 degrees fahrenheit and be completely normal the problem with that is when they get a fever that temperature could be actually what is normal for someone that is younger and the purpose of a fever is to fight pathogens to help you decrease the duration of an infection so if you instantly go to ibuprofen and tylenol and try to break the fever you infection a lot longer than you should also a fever helps mobilize and increase your white blood cells so it fascinating there speed up this cycle of an infection one is to take the right nutrients now with children i found if you give them calcium like calcium lactate it seems to help them overcome an infection very fast and it i naturally which is really just improving their ability to overcome this infection and in addition to calcium trace minerals are really important and the other thing that important is fasting apparently when you get an infection you lose your appetite and you should just basically go for a period of time without eating because that actually strengthen your immune system big time but let just kind of go through the different age ranges and when you should call your doctor if you have an infant younger than three months if the temperature is over 100.4 degrees fahrenheit you might want to check with your doctor if your child is between 3 months to 3 years if it goes over 102.2 degrees fahrenheit check with your doctor now between the ages of 4 and 18 if the temperature gets over 104 fahrenheit you might want to check with your doctor and if you over 18 and it fahrenheit check with your dog but generally if it i would do things to strengthen the immune system and not automatically trying to turn off this fever with a medication instead i would recommend getting in a hot bath wearing a lot of clothes when you go to sleep so you can sweat it off that always seems to work very very nicely now some interesting points about temperature in general when a person is lying the temperature of their forehead their eyes and their neck go up yet the temperature of their nose goes down so the next time when someone is potentially lying to you go ahead and put your hand on their forehead while they question is there anything that you that you shouldn actually don ask that question now when you consume red hot chili peppers your temperature actually goes up so one thing i like about red hot chili peppers in fact peppers in general any type of peppers not only can they actually help increase a fever but they loaded with vitamin c so any hot and spicy peppers is a very good thing to take when you infection now this next one is a bit of a side note um people tend to sleep better in a colder room and generally when you smoke you increase your temperature and i don recommend smoking if you have a fever but the point is when you get a fever you actually want to enhance the fever by staying hot hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it and here here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today	Success
Postmenopausal Women Need More Butter and Egg Yolks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zScbg5UNBgw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	postmenopausal women need more butter and more egg yolks why because they osteoporosis or osteopenia because of the shift in hormones their estrogen and progesterone just took a tank downward and now they they have to build bone now the mistake that a lot of women make is they go right for the calcium they start taking calcium supplements like calcium carbonate big mistake because that increases the risk of heart attacks the vitamin that they really need more of is vitamin k2 this is not k1 it and guess where you get k2 grass-fed butter egg yolks and several other foods let just go through the list grass-fed butter and you can probably put this on your keto bread recipe organ meats cheeses egg yolks dark chicken meat fish eggs as in caviar nato this is a fermented soybean some people cannot stand it but it something that they consume in japan breast milk i just added this in here just so you know that vitamin k2 is in breast milk not that you you know get your k2 from this lard by the way entalo this is pig fat and this is beef fat is both of these are really good to cook with because they have vitamin k2 and they also have vitamin d versus other oils like vegetable oils which is very very bad but vitamin k2 binds calcium with protein and in your bones you have a lot of protein you have a lot of calcium so you need k2 to do the job also vitamin k2 controls calcium into the bone it makes the bone very very solid and strong vitamin k2 decreases calcification in your arteries it helps a person blood sugars it decreases the risk of kidney stones cancer and also the risk of getting dementia western price was a dentist wrote a book and this is way back years ago before vitamin k2 was ever even recognized or discovered and he called vitamin k2 activator x that because there was there was no name for vitamin k2 and he found that it was a missing nutrient for a lot of things especially related to bone teeth dental formation and a lot of other things so if you post-menopausal don you know some cheese would be better to get your calcium consume some of these foods and definitely definitely do not go on a low fat diet thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it and here here environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today	Success
Depression and the HPA Axis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNll4oTHsQk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let axis now what does hpa stand for hypothalamus pituitary and adrenals okay so we have this feedback mechanism a certain hormone is made by the hypothalamus which is kind of like the true master gland and it which is like the middle man it football team and then you have the coach right and then the coach then gives it to one of the players and that communication is another hormone that then tells the adrenals what to do and so the adrenals then make its hormones and we talking about the cortisol which then creates its effect and then there the pituitary and hypothalamus to turn off that communication so we have a communication cycle where we that and then there to turn off that communication because we don because that body which is exactly what happens when you keep stimulating cortisol with chronic stress there that cortisol affects and that involves memory learning and what happens with high levels of cortisol over a longer period of time you have a shrinkage of the hippocampus and that okay so what is the relationship between this hpa access and depression it stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and the flight or fight mechanism the first thing that with someone is they anxiety and then as time goes on it starts to go into depression on the flip side you have the opposing system it parasympathetic nervous system and so we have the sympathetic which is fight or fight and the parasympathetic which is the rest in digest the parasympathetic well both systems are like a wave system in the body the sympathetic nervous system raises the pulse rate for example and then the parasympathetic kicks in let it wave mechanism that brings things back to normal when that system is dysregulated you can also develop depression okay so you can actually predict depression if you have a malfunctioning parasympathetic nervous system so we have two things we have a dysfunction with an overactive uh flight or fight mechanism and then we have another problem where we lose the brake pads the thing that so you can develop depression from both mechanisms now what can someone do if they have depression from chronic stress well reduce the cause of the stress whatever that is it must be reduced number two magnesium helps support and helps normalize an overactive hpa axis mechanism now fasting really can help someone fasting not only brings up your emotional state and is one of the best things for depression but can also reduce the stress on the hpa axis now of course i would always recommend combining it with ketones because ketones are part of that because when you put someone in ketosis it away from burning glucose because glucose can also affect someone into a blood sugar anxiety or even a depression aerobic exercise is also very therapeutic of reversing the damage to the hippocampus because we want to flood the brain with lots of oxygen so a lot of long walks would be very therapeutic vitamin d vitamin d not only is great for someone who is depressed but it can support the hypothalamus pituitary adrenals and especially cortisol vitamin d is a steroid hormone and so it can help support the adrenals and anytime someone has a an elevated cortisol they vitamin d now the herb rhodiola is another really good herb that can act as an adaptogen for these problems don sleep because if you virtually impossible to reverse the damage in the system and then vitamin b1 from nutritional yeast is also very very important in supporting stress in general hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it and here here environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today	Success
Cold Feet? Don't Forget Iodine	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhhc7sYpS20	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now if you have a cold feet you don want to forget about iodine i several other videos on this topic there iodine deficiency is definitely one of them let an iodine deficiency to kind of observe some of the symptoms that can occur number one a slower metabolic rate your metabolism is dependent on iodine why because iodine is part of the thyroid system and without iodine your thyroid cannot work the thyroid innervates every single mitochondria that of your cells so without iodine you have a slow metabolism you you have hair loss possibly dry skin but definitely you trouble learning is connected to low iodine especially in a child a lower iq is also associated with an iodine deficiency especially if the mother who iodine a child related to iodine and it very important for a woman who pregnant to get enough iodine problem is trying to get enough iodine from food because the soils are so depleted so unless you sea or sea kelp or you supplement or a trace mineral supplement you may not get enough so it important thing that child will also have trouble learning if they and iodine does a lot of other things but one thing it definitely will do as well is help buffer excessive amounts of estrogen so if there dominant situation iodine can help to regulate that and this is why it really beneficial for something like ovarian cyst or a fibrocystic breast where a female has too much estrogen the iodine can actually help to bring that down to a normal level and just so you know globally there 1572 million people on this planet who are at risk for having an iodine deficiency and again iodine is not just for the thyroid it actually is involved in a lot of other things but let of iodine seek help what well number one it source it but it has a lot of other things as well it has high levels of manganese which is a trace mineral that has a good amount of iron which is another common deficiency in children in certain parts of the world it has a good amount of zinc it has a good amount of selenium it has a good amount of potassium and magnesium and even calcium it also has vanadium which is an interesting trace mineral vanadium in animal studies can act like estrogen so it and then we have another natural chemical called fucoidin which has anti-cancer properties as well as anti-tumor properties which is interesting and then there in sea kelp called fucoxanthin which can help you lose weight and then we have something called alginate which is a fiber which has the capacity to inhibit the absorption of certain fats that apparently helps people lose weight but again this is not going to be the weight loss secret if your diet is high in carbs so if you down below to learn more about keto but getting back to cold feet if you want to use sea kelp to help that condition you take not large amounts just like one capsule of sea kelp in the early morning not right before you go to bed because it generally will wake you up and give you energy and you want to take that for two to three weeks because sometimes it takes a while to kick in but if your problem is in iodine deficiency and you have some of these items right here it just may be the thing to warm you up hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it want you to take it and here here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today	Success
For Narcolepsy Do This... - OKAY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfMK31lOa0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let well it excessive daytime sleepiness as well as something called cataplexy which is a sudden loss of muscle tone in response to a strong emotion okay so whether it or even exercise could do this and so it major problem for people now as far as the cause of narcolepsy if you do research you that they don one cause is a genetic it with a gene related to the orexin system which has to do with your wakefulness being awake so this gene is associated with carnitine which has to do with fatty acid metabolism and the mitochondria and so this system is like the brain sensor and it actually requires six times the amount of atp to fire and so if this system is not working you tired but you sleep and it just so happens also if you have high levels of glucose that can also inhibit the firing of this mechanism as well thus the recommendation of doing keto which is very very important another trigger for this condition is a side effect from a certain flu vaccine okay which i really can because they wanted to mention that you can look it up now one risk factor for getting this condition is obesity and type 2 and type 1 diabetes and so it associated with insulin and glucose so if i had this condition this is what i would do i would make sure i keto and definitely intermittent fasting i would also take acetyl l carnitine okay because you to overcome the defect or the blockage in the receptor for carnitine a polymorphism is a genetic problem where you so you just want to take more of it to make it work better now as far as the next thing i to recommend is b1 there interesting data on this which i link down below but you would have to consume large amounts of b1 to create this effect like between 100 and 150 milligrams b1 acts as a cofactor for the metabolism of glucose in the brain even though someone they not the entire part of the brain is running on ketones a portion of it is running on glucose and that comes from your body making glucose and so your brain needs some glucose but you don make it and b1 is necessary in the metabolism of glucose in the mitochondria in the brain another cofactor or helper nutrient would be magnesium i would recommend taking larger amounts like 750 milligrams of magnesium this is the protocol that i would take if i had narcolepsy	Success
The 1st Symptom of a Salt Deficiency	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkpvPrek3X8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let symptoms that can occur if you salt in your body which this is actually very very common it weakness you why first of all the the root word salad is a latin word for salted greens okay because the romans used to dip their lettuce in salt which is interesting the word salary or sale sal is the latin word for salt and the romans sometimes used to get paid in salt instead of money which is another interesting point you should never consume refined salt always is sea salt that himalayan salt is great there other salts that are just as good because the refined salt is just sodium chloride and you other minerals in the right balance that you need plus to add aluminum which is not good salt is also needed to make hydrochloric acid in your body to help digest protein to help absorb minerals to help kill pathogens and many people are low in hcl and then they start getting acid reflux indigestion bloating especially as you get older an average person as a very minimum needs one teaspoon of sea salt every single day but in many cases they need more especially if they exercise or do the ketogenic diet now i think the worst scenario a person can be in is if they on a low salt diet and they lots of water so they that little bit of salt that they have and then they get on a diuretic which will then cause the water to come out but also the sodium too making them very deficient in sodium and if they with all those other factors what going to happen is they retain the fluid in the sodium but in the wrong places so they situation so you to have this feeling of weakness and tiredness and then when you consume some salt you away so if you this just add a little more salt to the diet and see if your energy doesn perk up when i take my electrolyte powder which has a lot of sodium i always add more salt to it especially if you and you refined carbs with all this extra sodium but if someone they diet then they don they already have too much sodium from things like the monosodium glutamate and the extra sodium that they put in a lot of junk foods but here why you get energy from sodium okay number one sodium excites the heart muscle so without enough sodium the heart can get enough oxygen to the cells you don nutrition you just as a side note when i talk about sodium i you wouldn sodium as an individual mineral because sodium works with so many other things so you want to get your sodium from sea salt now sodium also regulates calcium calcium homeostasis so without sodium calcium can so then you don the muscles you don the heart and you can you need okay so that relationship is very very important also sodium is involved in this really key pump in the cells that produce voltage because the cell is like a battery so you need sodium for that pump you also need potassium as well and so if you have low voltage okay in the body and here another interesting thing about sodium sodium is very important it in making energy in the mitochondria in your kidneys you have the most concentrated mitochondria okay simply because sodium is so important that the kidney has to maintain a very high level of energy to recycle sodium and so this is just another reason why the body considers sodium as something that is very very important and last point sea water the chemistry of seawater is virtually identical to the watery portion of your blood so when you consume more sea salt you hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it and here here environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today	Success
Low Vitamin D Linked to Depressed Teens	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN7n7ZA-CPw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	there recently that talks about vitamin d levels linked to depressed teens so i want to talk about that one of the symptoms of a vitamin d deficiency would be sadness hopelessness but there interest loss of concentration even thoughts of suicide is linked to a low vitamin d level which is quite incredible the problem is that not only does this involve teens but it affects everyone in fact 75 of the population has low vitamin d levels now specifically for teens here they don enough sun they computer a lot of times they don get magnesium which is essential for vitamin d to work so they usually have magnesium deficiencies as well teenagers tend to snack a lot that creates insulin resistance which also blocks vitamin d they diet which creates insulin resistance which blocks vitamin d and if they consuming fructose as in high fructose corn syrup that can block vitamin d more than glucose actually now if a teen is overweight or obese that can increase the need for vitamin d so that vitamin d deficiency and also if they have darker skin that can block vitamin d absorption from the uv light now other symptoms of a vitamin d deficiency is achy joints low back pain lethargy insomnia anxiety so this is a very very simple solution to a very big problem unfortunately a lot of kids are then put on antidepressant medication when i think they should just take some vitamin d 10 000 i use and i would also include magnesium with it i would also include vitamin k2 because all of those together will enhance the absorption of vitamin d3 and actually greatly elevate the mood in addition to giving your teen vitamin d i would also highly recommend getting them to get out in the sun consume more vegetables right stop the snacking there fasting if you i put a link down below and get on a low carb diet which is in that same link down below because that will greatly improve the metabolism and help them lose weight and help them actually absorb vitamin d all right thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it and here here environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today	Success
Why the Random Muscle Twitch?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtt-aJXmg3U	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you ever get a random muscle twitch for no reason well you population gets these random muscle twitches the medical term for that is fasciculation not that you really cared but that it contraction and relaxation it could be on the eyelid it could be on the arm your hands fingers legs or feet or even your tongue there even a medical condition called benign fasciculation syndrome the problem is that this condition is a nutritional deficiency but their treatment is cognitive behavioral therapy and anti-depression medication and calcium channel blockers which i going to come back to in a second so what you need to know is the random muscle twitching is simply a magnesium deficiency and by the way 70 percent of the population has a magnesium deficiency well must be a coincidence right if you have a magnesium deficiency there are other things that can happen as well you could be tired you could have muscle cramps you could have anxiety because people take magnesium to relax decrease their stress to help them with sleep so if you have these muscle twitches just take a little magnesium magnesium usually comes from leafy greens so it could be that you enough but there are a couple of the reasons why you might have a muscle twitch it could be that you have high amounts of calcium now calcium magnesium work together the higher the calcium the lower magnesium so that would actually correlate and also if you have low vitamin d levels that could be another reason why you might have twitching now there is a relationship between vitamin d and magnesium i it and the last reason why you might have a muscle twitch is you have alkalosis and by the way if your ph is too alkaline that can inhibit the calcium from transporting throughout the body in fact it can build up on nerves and create the twitching and this is why apple cider vinegar is a good remedy for that but a deeper cause of alkalosis could be either you diet or your potassium is too low but what i you some simple clues that you can identify nutritional deficiencies with and if you have a muscle twitch it usually going to be magnesium hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it and here here environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today	Success
The First Sign of a Zinc Deficiency is...	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neuWm45EnI4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let first sign of a zinc deficiency now clinically when you deficient in zinc all sorts of things happen a lack of growth anorexia tissue necrosis you can actually get tissue dying from a lack of zinc all sorts of skin issues all sorts of digestive issues infection viruses bacteria hair loss ulcers and the list goes on and on you don you deficient in zinc well to answer that we need to kind of look at some other data number one when you low in zinc you will have a lowered amount of very specific antioxidants glutathione alpha tocopherol and catalase which has to do with the detoxification of hydrogen peroxide so in other words very powerful antioxidants in our bodies are dependent on zinc and without zinc you will not be able to produce these in sufficient amounts now there i want to share with you cardiac tissue or heart tissue is the highest producer of something called ross so just think about ross as something that creates a lot of oxidation and the heart cells as a tissue if we compare it to other tissues in the body has one the lowest antioxidant capacity now what does that mean so in other words it becomes very susceptible to becoming damaged this is probably why the number one cause of death is heart disease the heart is not able to repair effectively and the first symptom is you get shortness of breath upon exertion so let you start to exercise or you run up the stairs and you would be the first symptom of a zinc deficiency so i remember as a kid living on sugar outside playing and noticing i was having a difficult time running up a hill i was like out of breath very easily i had no clue on what that was but it was probably a zinc deficiency due to all the sugar that was consuming and so if you have that symptom watch a lot more of my videos on zinc i put the links down below check it out hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it and here here environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today	Success
Zinc Starves Deadly Bacteria	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgZgRnnAeQs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	this is interesting zinc has the ability to starve off deadly bacteria we pneumonia and this was published in the journal of nature chemical biology now normally this bacteria streptococcus pneumonia lives a part of our friendly bacteria as a normal bacteria it unless certain conditions occur but it lives in our sinuses it lives in our throat and it perfectly friendly until it becomes pathogenic especially when you and you your immune system is compromised when you you when you have hiv that microbe flips over to become pathogenic and this is wow but this bacteria actually kills a million people a year from pneumonia and meningitis a million people and you find out just with a little bit of zinc it could be totally prevented okay now what does zinc do to this bacteria well this bacteria is dependent on another mineral called manganese manganese allows for transportation okay it dependent on this little transporter like a little car so zinc goes in there and locks up the key so manganese cannot get in there anymore making this transporter unavailable for this bacteria not to mention other things that zinc will do to bacteria but this is a very powerful one so it get enough zinc in their diet a zinc deficiency is probably one of the top nutritional deficiencies on this planet primarily because of how much cereal that we consume because grains have phytic acid that block zinc so you would want to avoid things with phytic acid i put a link down below of a video that i just did on that also on the diet to get zinc you need red meat or shellfish or fish if you chances are you in zinc due to the quantities of phytic acid now if you also have gut inflammation or any type of gut issues you absorbing zinc and so it to me of how this trace mineral needed in very trace amounts very small amounts can create so much health and can prevent so much destruction hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it and here here everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today	Success
How to Overcome Infertility	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxwqpMOMM34	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so how does a woman become more fertile okay there number one you have to avoid things that interfere with the endocrine system and that would be avoiding something called endocrine disruptors by consuming organic foods and staying away from pesticides insecticides herbicides fungicides things like that i have a lot of information on that i put some links down below but in this video we want to talk about what to take to enhance fertility whether you have pcos endometriosis fibroids or some other condition which throws off your menstrual cycle or you have repeated miscarriages or whatever it is the most important thing to do is healthy keto because as you you have high levels of insulin okay so if you diet the ovaries response to that is to increase more androgens okay and then that disrupts the entire fertility so get unhealthy keto healthy keto is also going to supply all the nutrients so let one something called l-methylfolate without enough folate there damage that can happen with your dna so folate protects the dna especially when you get pregnant you don or damage to the dna because the body is going to have a natural tendency to abort okay so folate very important number two zinc zinc is very very important in making sure that the egg matures properly from a small little follicle to a fertile egg and it just so happens that sperm is loaded with zinc and so that zinc is essential to make sure that that egg survives all right next point is selenium selenium is a powerful trace mineral it it has many different purposes one being decreasing the risk for a miscarriage also it supports the fluid around the egg and so if there radical damage or oxidation going on it those free radicals okay number four vitamin d vitamin d supports the uterus it also supports the placenta and it decreases the risk of pcos okay number five omega-3 that includes epa and dha now omega-3 supports something called a cervical mucus and that has everything to do with making sure that the sperm survives once it hits the mucus so it can travel through the mucous and get to where it needs to go omega-3 also keeps the uterus very very healthy and prevents inflammation of the uterus all right number six b vitamins you can get these from nutritional yeast but they the ovary health all right number seven iron iron increases fertility what needed by a plant to increase its fertility all right number eight vitamin e vitamin e is known as the fertile vitamin in both men and women so one of the things it will do it supports the cervical mucus all right and then we have certain herbs number nine we now chase barrier which is known to increase fertility it around for a very long time it also decreases prolactin levels which increases your risk for infertility all right number 10 chitaberry that extract that increases cervical mucus to support the sperm it also decreases pcos it supports follicle development which actually then will turn into an egg and just generally it improves the quality of the egg itself number 11 maca root that supports the endocrine system in females all right number 12 we have white peony root this supports fertility decreases risk for pcos decreases prolactin levels it will also inhibit endometriosis and it also has something called aromatase which converts testosterone to estrogen so if someone has pcos this would be really really good to take as well and number thirteen this is a form of inositol called d-chiro-anasatol anosytol is essential for the axis between the hypothalamus pituitary and the gonads so it can help a lot of female problems including making insulin more sensitive and if you noticed throughout this entire video pcos is a common thing that will make you infertile and it all has to do with keeping your insulin lower alright thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it want you to take it and here here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today	Success
Mouthwash Can Cause Bad Breath - OKAY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFbDBP8FR-4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	do you realize that mouthwash can actually cause you to get bad breath now you probably heard that mouthwash kills 99 of the germs that cause bad breath that the good bacteria that keeps the bad bacteria in check and you might know that one of the side effects of taking an antibiotic is a yeast infection right that of fungus well the same thing happens in your mouth you have something called oral flora which is the friendly microbiome the microbes in your mouth which has a lot to do with protecting your immune system since you have a lot of pathogens that can come through the mouth so when you kill those microbes you get rid of the defense for the pathogens the bad bacteria in your mouth and the friendly yeast in your mouth that then switches over into an overgrowth of unfriendly yeast and that this might gross you out but there entire ecosystem of microbes there literally over a thousand different species of different microorganisms growing in your mouth and these traditional mouthwashes have alcohol and other chemicals that throw everything out of whack so at first it might work it freshens your breath then as you continue to use it you might notice that wow why is my breath getting worse there are a lot of other solutions that work a lot better but the primary thing is making sure that you preserve that flora in your mouth and so you don less invasive things like baking soda sea salt mint leaves oral probiotics but in summary it good microbes that keep the bad microbes from overgrowing and causing bad breath	Success

Why Don't Chickens that Eat Ticks Get Lyme Disease	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn8VYEWcoUk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	this video is about ticks i had another question why don ticks get lyme disease okay because it really reported it think there case where a chicken actually got lyme disease and plus the fact that chickens are known to eat ticks if you let them free range around your your farm or your house and since i living on a farm right now i have about 20 chickens and so hopefully they ticks around our area now when i did some research on this topic i found one experiment that related to this topic and basically exposed the chicken to a tick that was carrying lime and the chicken strong enough to defend against this bacteria now the other thing you need to know is that not all ticks carry the lyme disease all right it could be less than one percent up to 50 so just because you get bit by a tick does not mean that you lyme disease and this percentage less than 1 to 50 depends on the location of where you are the other point about ticks is they have to be attached to your body between 36 to 48 hours or longer before the lyme bacteria can be transmitted so if it 36 hours chances are that you don about it also it takes three to five days for that tick to fill up blood that tick it could be between two to three days and so if it hasn filled up with blood good chance that uh you be infected now getting back to this chicken question the first thing is chickens don teeth so if they they or a worm and it their esophagus and it called the crop and the crop is kind of a temporary storage place which has friendly bacteria it has lactic acid so it starts the digestive process then it goes to this thing called a true stomach and that strong acid very similar to a human stomach where the ph is between one and three okay actually 1.3 to 3.5 that acid alone is going to start to destroy the tick or the insect okay plus it going to activate a very powerful enzyme called pepsin which is going to start to dissolve this protein shell around this tick and so it going to survive the stomach then after that it ends up in something called the gizzard which is another stomach area where you have all these muscles and you also have grit which is like sand oyster shells or little rocks that are going to act as teeth to start grinding down the food even further and so that tick really has no chance of surviving uh these stages of a chicken so if you you it if you content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below	Success
How the Common Cold MAY Protect Against Covid-19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5wmfQYUU_Q	Dr. Eric Berg DC	here common cold actually protect you against copit19 now rhinovirus infections are basically the common cold infections rhino means nose so it infection and children can get anywhere between 6 to 12 rhinovirus infections every year but these researchers at the yale school of medicine found something very interesting related to rhinovirus infections they found that your interferon production goes way up interferon is a defense mechanism against viruses so the more colds that a person had the more interferon that is present in the sinuses and the more protection you have against viruses even covet 19. now with this experiment that these researchers did they infected airways with covet 19 with people who never had the rhinovirus okay and they found the viral loads doubling every six hours for three days so there was this massive infection going on with cover 19. and then they compare this to another group of humans who were exposed to the renal virus the common cold and then when they infected them with covert 19 the replication actually halted which is quite fascinating because they had plenty of interference present and this could be another reason why children for example rarely ever get covered 19 there one of them because they have a lot more interference so anyway i thought it was an interesting study but relating to covet 19 i think your best thing to do is keep your immune system very very strong and if you haven yet on how to bulletproof your immune system i put a link down below check it out	Success

Prevent Headaches While in an Airplane	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oSWEzVyOuU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let headaches if you in fact 1 out of 12 people experience headaches when they things that occur in the brain you have increase of something called prostaglandins that compound that increases when you have inflammation and in fact aspirin works by inhibiting uh prostaglandins and when you have more prostaglandins you have an expansion of your blood vessels in the brain and that causes the pain in your head so these headaches occur from two situations number one you have this change in pressure when you take off and when you land okay that and that affects uh the sinus cavities and number two you get this spike in cortisol okay so the cortisol can also produce headaches and anxiety so we have cortisol then we have this change in pressure which affects the sinus cavities okay so what can you do so the most important thing to do is to completely relax when you fly there video that i think you should watch if you have a problem relaxing and i that link down below where you actively cause the different parts of your body just to relax more and more and more so you don really tense and stressed out another point to acknowledge is that the statistics for deaths when you majorly less than the statistics when you are in car accidents and you die so if we did a comparison on the stats of flying there okay a flight now if we compare that to cars that you can see there difference and it much safer flying than riding in a car all right motorcycle accidents we have 212.6 deaths per 1 billion miles okay so that higher than cars so overall if you driving a car and you want to look at the percentage of dying when you from flying it driving in a car it chance of dying when you accident so again that might help reduce your stress and put you at ease hopefully maybe not maybe another thing you should do is take adaptogens i put a link down below of a good one that i recommend these are herbal things that help you relax and the other thing is to do controlled breathing whether your inhalation or exhalation is too short or too long you want to even these out so you breathing in just as much as you breathing out that can really help calm you down and the other thing to do is start fasting because when you actually pull yourself out of the fight mode and that can help you so don don because that you so you want to do fasting through the whole flight which will definitely strengthen you and make you feel better mood wise with enough fluids with electrolytes to prevent dehydration which can then also cause a headache so these are just a few tips that you can use but also watch the video on relaxation i think that can help you greatly hey before you go if you content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below	Success
7 Things that Can Pull You Out of Depression	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFSCcG53H6c	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let can pull you out of a depression now there called bdnf that stands for brain derived neurotrophic factor and depression they found that there in your body or blood test or whatever that can diagnose depression okay there way to diagnose that but they actually found that people that are depressed have low levels of this bdnf so i video and talk about how you can enhance it because all the clinical trials that they try to inject this vdnf into the central nervous system have failed the question is how can we enhance it i ways but let the dnf it is basically fertilizer for the brain okay it helps nerve growth it helps nerve differentiation so it helps to differentiate what these uh stem cells or like pre-nerve cells turn into also bdnf helps support the maintenance of the synapses between the nerves and so bdnf actually works in the synapse which is kind of like the space between the two nerves so as they communicate they have a space to actually go back and forth so the bdnf a message is sent and it gets received so the other part of the nerve can then receive that communication and do what it helps the brain in many different ways it helps improve your learning it helps your memory it helps higher thinking it helps you think more clearly it helps you become more mentally alert it decreases inflammation in the brain and it also helps the absorption of neural transmitters like dopamine serotonin things that have a direct effect on your mood alright so let things that you can do to increase this bdnf number one deep sleep okay researchers found that sleep deprivation reduces bdnf so you need at least seven hours of sleep and more importantly you need quality sleep recently i experiment on myself getting more sleep to see how i feel so i nine hours of sleep which is really really hard so i think i but man does that create an interesting effect on my body i feel so much better when i get more sleep so i literally have to force myself to be in bed because usually at 4 30 i like ready to go so i have to kind of just wait for a while and then i fall back into sleep going through a rem sleep i wake up i go back into a rem sleep and i do that like maybe three more times after 4 30. so sleep is very very important number two exercise exercise is the fastest and most effective way to increase brain derived neurotrophic factor all right next thing sunlight okay not just vitamin d but getting more sun very very therapeutic in increasing bdnf all right number four intermittent fasting as well as regular fasting like periodic prolonged fasting very very important they found that the alternative day fasting where you every other day can increase the bdnf by 400 percent i think if you do every day fasting about 18 hours i think you see a huge change in increasing bdnf all right next thing is low carb keto okay that can increase bdnf and of course number six really is keto avoiding sugar but the action of avoiding sugar directly can help you lose weight and as someone loses weight their bdnf increases and the last thing you can do to increase your bdnf is start taking magnesium or eat foods that are high in magnesium like large amounts of vegetables big salads because magnesium is a natural antidepressant and magnesium is not just in greens it in pumpkin seeds too it pumpkin seeds so you might want to add those to your diet as well all right thanks for watching and i will see you in the next video hey before you go if you from any of my content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below	Success
What Makes Good Bacteria Turn Bad	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0B8vRvIY2Q	Dr. Eric Berg DC	i want to talk about why harmless bacteria can turn bad so there different relationships that we have with bacteria you have good bacteria that exchange with us we provide a home for them to live in they give us vitamins immune protection then you have another relationship with bacteria which is commensal in which one organism benefits with another without hurting them or necessarily helping them so in this relationship they there they they sometimes they will flip in the relationship with us and turn pathogenic which they can cause disease and there a handful these bacteria that can do this a certain types of strep bacteria e coli candida that basically is harmless and then something happens and they flip and they start creating harm in fact some of these bacteria in a 30-day cycle can go through 500 generations and morph into something very harmful to our bodies they can go from harmless to actually killing us now the key factor that changes this relationship is the environment that they live in it pressures so when this environment changes in ph oxygen levels oxidative stress temperature chemicals and this can all occur with what you put in your body what you expose your body to in a mainly talking diet based on what you feed your body the environment can change from one spectrum to the other people that live on junk food end up having a lot more pathogens people that eat healthier have less pathogens and of course this also relates to plants if a plant is given enough nutrients they have less pests they have less pathogens they have less disease and so the nutrients build up our own defenses so in other words the good bacteria can actually defend us and protect us against the pathogens so um one big factor that changes the environment really fast is antibiotics because for some reason bacteria don you try to kill them they resist being killed because they want to survive and so they start to become super bugs resistant to that antibiotic and they flip their relationship and they start to harm us an example that would be this infection called mrsa and you usually see this in hospitals and mrs a very highly resistant strand of bacteria that is very difficult to kill with anything including antibiotics another example would be c diff and there occurs too with bacteria when they stressed because of environmental pressures is they start developing these little igloos to live in that called biofilms so they start to develop colonies and protect themselves against anything that can try to kill them and now we have a situation because these biofilms are very very difficult to get rid of and they and pathologies now the other thing i want to point out is this when our bodies are under stress our immune system becomes weakened in other words all the white blood cells become suppressed so stress increases cortisol that shuts down our immune system and this makes us very susceptible to developing additional infections and susceptible to pathologies and pathogens so out of all the things that can harm us from an infection i would say stress hands down is the single biggest factor now the next thing i want to bring up is an interesting strategy that bacteria do when they under stress it so when these bacteria are under stress they will literally grab the dna from other dead bacteria pull them into themselves and start to manipulate that dna to become more of a pathogen it sex where you other dna from a bacteria or a virus i mean that so there are some things you can do about this to prevent these pathogens from existing number one make sure that the environment that your microbes live in is very very friendly make sure you only take an antibiotic if you absolutely positively need it and also if you are taking an antibiotic also at the same time take a probiotic the other thing is do whatever you can to minimize your stress level watch my videos on that make sure your diet is very very good because especially if you carb diet you that yeast and candida and make them grow because they live on glucose but the other thing that you can do that intermittent fasting fasting strengthens your immune system fasting strengthens the diversity of your good bacteria and so fasting is a necessity not only as a preventative thing but also if you actually have pathogens in your body hey before you go if you from any of my content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below	Success
Best Vitamin If You Grind Your Teeth	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDwwt7A-xAo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	someone had a question related to grinding of the teeth at night could it be a vitamin deficiency and the answer is yes it could be and that vitamin deficiency is vitamin d now what is the association between grinding of the teeth ruxism and vitamin d well there are so many sleep disorders including sleep apnea different types of insomnia including cramps in your feet at night that are related to low levels of vitamin d now it could also mean that you calcium or magnesium now if you sure you don too much it can actually create the same symptoms as a calcium deficiency which i will do a video on that so it might be a good idea to take a small amount of calcium or just get your calcium from food now also vitamin d deficiency is also associated with anxiety so if you with a vitamin d deficiency the anxiety alone can cause you to grind your teeth so a simple solution to find out if this is the cause of your problem is just take about 10 000 iu vitamin d3 at dinner time and just make sure that that dinner also includes a little cheese so you get your calcium and then see if you observe any improvements with grinding the teeth now the difficult thing about this is to know if you are grinding your teeth less because you don teeth so you one out there is some good data to show that vitamin d deficiency is associated with bruxism hey before you go if you from any of my content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below	Success
Mitochondrial Protector: AMPK	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5-woTbSCdI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today i word all right it and then i is but this way you can go to a party and sound very smart so what is this word the word is ampk what does that stand for five prime adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase okay so just memorize that word and you can use it at a party so what is this thing well it mitochondria protector they call it the guardian of your metabolism now in this sense metabolism isn necessarily just about weight loss it energy is produced in the mitochondria so basically it of energy homeostasis so homeostasis is the ability to adapt the internal part of your body to the external part the environment so we can maintain survival so if it cold outside our body starts to shiver to increase temperature that if you were to run up stairs your pulse rate would go up to adjust for the need for oxygen to your brain so you wouldn homeostasis so ampk basically is an enzyme that adapts to things that deplete your cellular energy so it senses this drop in energy in the atp which is like the energy currency of the body within the mitochondria and then it adapts the mitochondria and other things to be more efficient so it can survive so it increase more atp and decrease the consumption of atp so basically it rewires your metabolism to make it more efficient so any time we efficiency in the cells we have to talk about autophagy an autophagy is the condition in your body where you old worn out cell parts and turning them into new cells so ampk triggers autophagy mitophagy now what is mitophagy that condition where you damaged mitochondria into new mitochondrion now what about that is there including cancer that are related to damaged mitochondria then we have something called xenophagy and that is the removal of intracellular pathogens and turn that material into new cells now isn rid of pathogens viruses and bacteria that are unwanted in your body and also as a side note it suppresses tumors it it helps you get rid of diabetes it helps get rid of a fatty liver but other than those things it pretty much doesn all right so now what of this enzyme the main thing we want to know is how do we trigger it right well anything that lowers your energy will trigger it like low glucose as in a low carb diet hypoxia i know what low oxygen i exercise with a certain breathing restriction mechanism to induce hypoxia and that can activate that as well we also have exercise okay because you glucose fasting of course is the big one you depleting your glucose and then running on ketones and metformin by the way which i recommending and i metformin either but i you that metformin is a synthetic version of a natural plant chemical that helps you with insulin it makes insulin more sensitive it also helps your liver not make so much glucose and of course a lot of diabetics are using metformin i i think out of all the medications for diabetes that one probably is the least damaging but if you highly recommend you start taking vitamin b1 and b12 because metformin can deplete you of b1 and that can increase your risk to lactic acidosis now there can increase this enzyme ampk polyphenols okay what are polyphenols it compound in certain plants resveratrol from red grapes can increase this enzyme certain phytonutrients in green tea can do it berberine is another natural extract that can help increase it curcumin is another one i on that ginseng is another one an alpha lipoic acid so anyway i just wanted to teach you this long complex word so you can sound smart at a party and comment down below and let me know how that goes hey before you go if you from any of my content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below	Success
Can Ascites Be Fixed?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLXh7kIg9bY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	in this video i something called ascites ascites is a condition where someone belly is protruded it it ascites is bag like because it looks like this bag that the appearance is usually protruded like a basketball it usually not sagging too much it of sticking out and if you tap on one side you kind of a ripple on the other side and this is because it fluid because the liver is leaking certain fluid into a sac around the abdominal organs the most common cause of ascites is cirrhosis this is a condition where the liver has so much scar tissue it now the liver can it the gut now there cirrhosis as well you can have cancer pancreatitis heart disease or even tb but most people with this condition um have cirrhosis now in past videos i talked about the guy on the beach with the speedo with this protruded belly he belly is protruding that kind of gives you a visual of what i associated symptoms that come with this we have portal hypertension which you have high blood pressure in the venous part of your body edema in the lower legs so let leg and it leaves an indentation okay it edema you may have spider veins around your abdomen or you might have a lot of bruising in the lower legs you might have gynecomastia which is breast tissue in men that normal you may even vomit blood as one of the side effects now another common symptom involves your brain where you have too much ammonia building up and that can create a lot of confusion and cognitive dysfunction and several remedies for that would be number one taking lactolose sauerkraut can help reduce ammonia from the body and consuming more vegetables would be a good thing making sure you don amounts of protein have a lesser amount and taking l-glutamine can help now what was in practice i had medical doctors come in as patients and i always ask them what is the typical treatment for societies medically and they would say a drainage so they would drain the fluid they would put the patient on a low salt diet they would give them a diuretic and many times they would have to be on the liver transplant list because other than these typical treatments there was no other treatment and i would always say like why wouldn with maybe something natural but they just not trained in these natural remedies so if i had ascites this is what i would do i would immediately start intermittent fasting because fasting can help reduce liver enzymes it can help improve liver function it can help decrease the growth of fibrous tissue and scar tissue lessening the intensity of cirrhosis i would also get on something called milk thistle which can be very hepatoprotective which means it protects the cells of the liver it can also reduce inflammation as well i would also get on vitamin e which is the most powerful antioxidant when it comes down to reducing oxidation free radical damage of various tissues as well as being anti-fibrotic so it slows down inflammation and slows down the process of the liver developing fibrous tissue and scar tissue the type of vitamin e that you take is very important i would only recommend taking tocotrinols not the tocopherols it times more potent the next thing i would take would be selenium selenium is one of the best antioxidants for the liver and i would definitely also go low carb because high carb creates more oxidation more scar tissue all right thanks for watching and i will see you in the next video hey before you go if you from any of my content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below	Success
Fastest Way To Get Fat That I Know	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQRFJ4fTx6M	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you know i to lose weight i haven on how to gain weight gain actual fat and i think it the flow because if you really know how to gain weight which a lot of people do then you can actually reverse this plan and actually help yourself lose weight now i stumbled on this uh this diet that just actually made me laugh it called the nibbling diet okay it was an actual diet the nibbling diet where you 17 snacks per day this was written in 1978 and basically not only do you have three meals and two snacks but you have additional snacks in between the snacks so this is actually even worse than the six meals per day plan that some people are doing and it also similar to the snack all day diet i there all day diet where you you per snack your dinner is 300 calories but you can do trades you can trade a snack for another snack or you can trade two snacks for a dinner because we all know that this whole calorie counting thing absolutely doesn million times it doesn it trying over and over and over again so let me get back to the nibbling diet the whole strategy of this nibbling diet where you this it makes you feel like you are in control because you anytime you want so you right well actually it you out of control what your hormones your hormones are so far out of whack that you are actually in the back seat and your hormones are driving the car and so this is just a disaster waiting to happen because every time you snack i don you snack on you up insulin it down up and down and guess what insulin is the hormone that converts your food into fat insulin is a hormone that makes you hungry and insulin is triggered by eating as well as eating carbs as well as eating anything and so every time you eat you jacking this thing up all day long 17 times right it put on fat let you have to gain some quick fat this would be the perfect diet to go on another rationale in this book is that animals eat all day long and they don talking about a cow right well first of all cows are fat and they eat grass so maybe you should start eating grass you can graze it all day long and maybe that don for a period of time without eating so they a lot of intermittent fasting and of course the cow is constantly regurgitating and and this grass is going through these four stomachs and it completely different digestive system than humans now the other rationale that they use in this book is that you want to eat to prevent hunger okay because if you hungry you might overeat so if you snacking just a small amount then you you but the problem is you up insulin so everything you is being converted into fat so that is not a good uh strategy and then they talk about these snacks are going to prevent a a low blood sugar situation so thereby cutting down on your hunger i guarantee this the more snacking you do the more hungry you be in fact snacking and binging is going to completely prevent your ability to tap into fat okay so you only have a little bit of sugar supply it you gonna put yourself in a serious situation where you gonna be fat and hungry and tired and then pre-diabetic and then diabetic so now that you know how to get fat let the opposite strategy which is intermittent fasting don insulin now your body can tap into fat an average person has almost an unlimited amount of fat to use as fuel versus the amount of stored sugar that you would use it very very small so you want to be able to tap into almost an unlimited amount of fuel and that way you you have no hunger your appetite is gone so you can lose weight much easier because you appetite you hungry if you the exact plan down below so just follow it and i promise you it will work hey before you go if you from any of my content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below	Success
Post COVID-19 Vaccine Shingles	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geznvEuEVeU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so i recently did a video on why everyone is getting shingles i you haven and i noticed that there people that were experiencing shingles after they had the covet 19 vaccine so i wanted to do a video on post code 19 vaccine shingles to give you a little more information on what i found when researching this topic so there has been an association with various skin or cutaneous manifestations and that includes conditions like diffuse erythematous eruptions which basically is kind of like a scattered rash of redness then you have another condition called verticarium which is like hives you have these itchy red little dots as well as chicken pox like skin lesions or fluid-filled blisters now this data is in america it other parts of the world but the johnson johnson vaccine which only requires one dose they don any type of shingle outbreaks now what different about that vaccine compared to the moderna and the pfizer vaccine is that the johnson and johnson vaccine use the traditional virus-based technology as compared to moderna and pfizer use the messenger rna technology and so it appears based on the data that the shingles outbreaks are more related to the messenger rna than the traditional virus vaccine now in february 5th 2021 there was the first report of shingles after a vaccination which was from the las vegas dermatology clinic which i put a link down below and since then they had five more reports and there was also an additional 14 that was reported or documented on social media so in my last video which i there are a handful of people who experience shingles after getting the vaccine and i want to talk about the reason why that could be so first of all we which have not gone through the usual testing like three to four or five or more years so they can really figure out the dosage and so you have two things you have what which is a toxin or a substance that your immune system is reacting to to create antibodies or immunity and you also have something called an adjuvant now that is something that is enhancing the immune reaction with this antigen and so some vaccines use aluminum which don also use other ingredients like soap like chemicals polyethylene glycol and even the lipid nanoparticle that transports this messenger rna can act as an adjuvant and so when someone exposed to both of these component parts there for about two to three weeks as the immune system is reacting and generating its antibodies and then on top of that we have people with a weak immune system whether they have metabolic syndrome or some other pre-existing health problem that complexity to this immune reaction and then compounded on top of that we have an entire population who either had the chickenpox or who had the chickenpox vaccine which means basically that they have this virus that is in their body waiting dormant that can be reactivated by this vaccine and a weakened immune system so that probably what question is if you have shingles what can you do about it for that data check out the link down below	Success

Vitamin B6 Deficiency in Women	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iO0s32J9bQs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let vitamin b6 in females now the big reason why i wanted to do a video on vitamin b6 in women is because 32 of all women have a vitamin b6 deficiency so i think it increase awareness on exactly what happens when you vitamin b6 is involved in over 140 different enzyme chemical reactions there number one it fat and carbohydrate metabolism and that involved in the red blood cell and number three it neurotransmitters and neurotransmitters are those communications that travel through the nervous system they hormones travel through the blood neurotransmitters travel through the nervous system and vitamin b6 also acts as an antioxidant and it can help you as an anti-inflammatory i think of b6 as that vitamin that is a helper compound that just allows other chemical reactions to work and so if you having certain problems trying to fix something it could be just you need more vitamin b6 because vitamin b6 is involved in so many different chemical reactions now we normally have hundreds of different microbes in our gut that make the b vitamins primarily vitamin b2 and vitamin b3 and there vitamin b6 but not in large amounts and so if you diet there close to getting it from these microbes now what microbiome is that they need nutrients to function they need nutrients from your diet and also many of the nutrients that we need come from the microbiome and so if you your diet that can affect the microbiome and a lack of microbiome can affect the nutrients that actually they give you now typically vitamin b6 comes from tuna turkey beef chicken salmon sunflower seeds spinach and there are many other foods as well but let symptoms that can occur if you deficient and you pms symptoms i depression irritability there showed that when you take b6 you can reduce the symptoms by 69 and even more than that if you add magnesium number two nausea pregnancy that is a b6 deficiency they don something to do with the neurotransmitters also if you have morning sickness or you you b6 is the answer you want to take 25 milligrams of b6 usually between one or two months if you also add some ginger that can actually help even more number three breast cancer risk may reduce if you have enough b6 number four fluid retention b6 can help get rid of excess fluid number five carpal tunnel syndrome especially if you have carpal tunnel syndrome you need vitamin b6 all right there you go that hey before you go if you content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below	Success

Acidify, Don't Alkalize Your Body	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa8pkW67LSM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so i keep getting this question over and over and over and over again so i going to do another video on this topic people want to know is it healthy to alkalize my body okay the truth is it body than to alkalize your body let me explain first of all we have this scale of ph and at seven we have neutral okay anything higher like in 8 9 10 11 12 you get a ph that the numbers that go higher are more alkaline the numbers that go lower like six five four are more acid and for every whole number you lower from seven to six you factor of 10. so for example if you have a ph of 5 that is 10 times more acid than a ph of 6. okay all right so that a lot of different parts of the body that have a lot of different phs the one that the stomach should be extremely acid like between one and three now if we compare this to the different fluids of the body the stomach is the most out of range ph okay in the entire body and so you have the stomach which is kind of like the main organ that is at the very beginning of the digestive cycle or the chain of events and so if that stomach doesn have a problem with it from that point on nothing else can work right and the reason i because you have various enzymes that are activated by your ph in other words enzymes those things that help you with digestion those magical little proteins that allow all the biochemistry to work are controlled by an optimum ph for example pepsin which is in the stomach which helps you digest protein works and is activated between the range of 1.5 and 1.6 i mean that extremely acid so pepsin will not work in an alkaline stomach okay that means you to be able to digest protein and if you that can end up in the small intestine is undigested protein and it can start creating purification and create all sorts of problems throughout this entire chain of events because you have like at least 30 feet of intestines right so you can imagine if you have undigested protein at the very beginning part what happens at the very end part then we have lipase which is an enzyme that helps you digest lipids or proteins that works in the pancreas and in an alkaline ph now there stomach that works in an acidic ph at four to five but the lipase in the pancreas works in an alkaline state so you have different enzymes in different parts that create different effects and then you have amylase which helps you digest starches right and that works in a slightly acidic to a neutral ph atp the energy currency of the body in the mitochondria works at a ph of 9. that which is another enzyme to help you break down arginine works in a ph of 10 extremely alkaline so what you need to know is that these magical enzymes that do their work cannot work unless they optimum ph okay so why is that significant because if you start to alkalize your body whether you carbonate and acids you dysfunction throughout the entire digestive system it effects that you alkalize your body why because the stomach is the main first digestive organ it in the beginning part okay and also the acid in your stomach triggers the bile release which is alkaline and the pancreatic enzymes it like bicarbonates from the pancreas that helps neutralize the acid both of those things are triggered by the acid stomach so in other words if you were to instead acidify the stomach you start to activate enzymes that help you break down proteins and now we have a more complete digestive chain of events and incidentally 22 percent of the population has low stomach acids that hypochlorhydria okay i of low stomach acid heartburn gas bloating food allergies mineral deficiencies gerd which is treated with antacids by the way and because you gut infections because the acid is supposed to kill off the microbes malabsorption because the acid stomach is supposed to help you absorb certain minerals you absorb b12 that well and also you risk for cancer in the stomach if you don but the other point i want to bring up is to have a strong acid stomach it to take an acid okay because to make hydrochloric acid a lot of times you just need the raw materials you need chloride for example that comes from salt which i would highly recommend consuming sea salt so if you chloride you can acid you also need sodium potassium zinc and even iodine to make hydrochloric acid however a lot of people see improvement by drinking just regular apple cider vinegar and retain hydrochloride which actually can help you acidify the stomach as well here healthier if you attempt to acidify the body than to alkalize the body simply because the stomach is the first huge significant organ of digestion and it start to alkalize the stomach now we create a problem through the entire rest of the digestive tract all right thanks for watching hey before you go if you content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below	Success
Age-Related Muscle Loss (Sarcopenia)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRABI0pBCPM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let sarcopenia age-related muscle loss now the greek word for sarcopenia means poverty of your flesh now sarcopenia is atrophy which is shrinkage and degeneration of your skeletal muscles those are the large muscles in the body as well as the quality of function of those muscles now normally sarcopenia starts with two specific areas in your body the quadricep that your thigh and then the abdominal muscles you just start losing the abdominal muscles so it it progresses you get a loss of the mass of muscle throughout the body you also lose your appetite to a certain degree you have a risk of falling and many times there becomes very very severe it by becoming immobile just not moving it efficiencies and definitely a lack of exercise or motion there when someone has sarcopenia number one the initial muscle mass and number two the rate of muscle mass decline the loss of weight and how rapid that occurs and that determine if you have sarcopenia but here it the most important thing is to add exercise routine regular consistent exercise it can dramatically slow the rate of muscle loss especially if you do a resistance type training where you whole body and you can use your own body weight as well whether it sit-ups etc number two vitamin d very very important minimally 10 000 ius but you probably want to go to 20 000 iu which is very important omega-3 fatty acids which is in fish oils or cod liver oil and then number four amino acids now i amino acids but keto essential amino acids has a very unique blend of all the essential amino acids that you should take especially leucine leucine has been found to stimulate uh muscle growth and prevent the loss of muscle so it really good for muscle atrophy and then we have something called h m b which is beta hydroxy beta methyl butyrate and this compound based on several studies has shown to significantly reduce the loss of muscle all right thanks for watching and i will see you in the next video hey before you go if you content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below	Success
Restore Your Sense of Smell	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNDNgPa4pbQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now i why someone might have a loss of smell the underlying cause whether it other cause i have some new information i want to share with you on restoring your sense of smell now in some recent research that i interesting data on insulin insulin is needed to repair the olfactory neurons okay now what you need to know is the olfactory neurons have everything to do with your receptors for smell which if damaged can majorly affect your ability to taste by like a factor of 80 percent so if you can be able to taste too well and the interesting data about this which i put a link down below is this the highest density and the highest concentration of insulin receptors in the brain are in the olfactory region of the brain okay now this probably relates to the link between insulin and the storage of food like fat and smell and taste related to appetite and so insulin has a huge role in the recovery of neurons after an injury okay so it it has everything to do with regenerating the olfactory neurons and so if there is not enough insulin available you from any type of injury to these neurons and this is why a diabetic and a pre-diabetic are hit a lot harder with the sense of smell after damaging those neurons than someone that doesn problem with insulin i mean if you even think about diabetics they also have a problem with losing their eyesight right well they can also lose their sense of smell now you might be saying well i not a diabetic i well chances are you may have insulin resistance which is a lot more common in fact probably 70 of the population has insulin resistance which means you may have the insulin deficiency on certain parts of your body as well as an insulin excess but as far as the neurons in the olfactory area in your sinuses chances are you could be very deficient in insulin if you have insulin resistance so then i started doing research on intra nasal insulin spray okay i wanted to know if there between spraying insulin into the sinuses directly affecting the olfactory bulb which is in your sinuses and to see if there improvement in smell and sure enough with just 40 units spraying up at your sinuses there was an immediate improvement in the sense of smell and smell differentiation between different odors there can do with a loss of smell you can start taking zinc there are certain types of essential oils that give off certain scents that you can retrain your your olfactory neurons but restoring insulin resistance so you have enough insulin to help repair these neurons i think is going to be probably the most important thing to do now i ton of videos and insulin resistance as you may know already if you channel but if you haven videos i think this is going to be very important for you to know or if you just want to improve your sense of smell number one you have to go on a low carb diet number two intermittent fasting is a must okay at least the fasting of 18 hours and if you put a link down below of how to do this correctly apple cider vinegar before bed like two tablespoons and some water would be very very beneficial to help with insulin resistance any type of exercise regular exercise is going to help you with insulin resistance vitamin d at least 10 000 iu can help you with insulin resistance enough potassium either in a supplement or potassium foods is going to be very important in restoring insulin resistance and enough vitamin b1 can also help and so the more you improve insulin resistance the more you normal insulin the more you have the ability to restore these neurons if they thanks for watching and i will see you in the next video hey before you go if you content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below	Success
Vertigo: The Best Remedy	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCPrEZun6hY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let if you have vertigo vertigo is a type of dizziness that occurs seconds after you have certain head movements you can feel like you you pretty devastating i want to share with you some interesting clues that can help us figure out what to do for this condition now one cause is having some type of mucus in your in your sinuses but the other thing i want to talk about is calcium deposits in the inner ear now there that there could be calcium deposits causing this problem number one a very popular medication they use for vertigo called flunarizine is a calcium antagonist which means it blocks calcium alright so that one it could be too much calcium another clue is a new study that i below so you can check it out relating to vitamin d and they only used 400 eye use and there was some really good results reducing the symptoms of vertigo now i would recommend at least 10 000 international units maybe even more at first if you trying to remove calcium from the body all right next clue is this in the inner ear you have receptors for vitamin d okay they receptors and you have quite a few and so vitamin d has everything to do with calcium metabolism and regulation as well as the immune system okay in your inner ear all right and last clue and i put these links down below there are quite a few reports of people having improvement by taking vitamin k2 for vertigo now what is vitamin k2 it different from vitamin k1 it helps you remove calcium from the wrong places in your body and so if there calcium in the joints or calcium in the eyes or calcium in the kidney vitamin k2 can help take that calcium and put it into the bone and so if there in the inner ear you vitamin k2 i would recommend taking vitamin d3 10 000 ius each day with a meal and at the same time take vitamin k2 i would recommend a mk7 version 100 micrograms and that way you have the right ratio of vitamin k2 and vitamin d3 to hopefully help reduce the calcium buildup in the inner ear and hopefully improve your vertigo symptoms hey before you go if you content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below	Success
Let Your Kids (or Yourself) Play in the Dirt More Often	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w0H2ywGaHI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now i want to talk about why your kids need to be playing in the dirt more often but not really the dirt the actual soil let dirt and soil dirt basically is dead you have sand rocks and clay soil is actually alive because it has microbial life it has bacteria fungus and the bacteria in the fungus make the nutrients available so i probably should have named it why your kids should be playing in the soil all right so here the reason you have two parts of your immune system you have the innate part which you given you this immunity from her being exposed to microbes and all those antibodies but then you have this other part of your immune system called the acquired and this is the part of your immune system that it learns from being in your environment and so if your child gets sick the best thing to do is to let them get sick and go through the infection and make sure they have all the key nutrients allow the fever to be there to kill off the pathogen and allow them to build up their antibodies that do as compared to shut off the immune system right away suppress the fever because what you they system as well and they probably are going to get sick more often and when they is going to be longer now there between your brain and your gut and in your gut you have all these microbes which play a very important part in your immune system it different microbes working together synergistically to help pathogens from invading into the body and so i want to emphasize the importance of your child being outside than being inside unfortunately recently many children are spending way too much time inside they don germs in the soil that can actually help greatly improve the immune system later in life there are some interesting studies i that demonstrates that if a child is outside more than inside they have a decreased risk in asthma allergies and even autoimmune diseases which is quite fascinating children that are outside more in nature have much less inflammation and respiratory illnesses have a much improved mental health status too both in cognitive function as well as mood and so it just about having your children play in the dirt or the soil it them outdoors in the woods in nature on a farm in one study it was interesting it showed that children that are raised in a farm are actually much healthier than their city counterparts and there study which i shows there children that are exposed more to nature being exposed to environments that uh involve trees uh grass parks rivers lakes and even the ocean and then you have the topic of forest bathing which i the immune system apparently there certain phyto chemical that is released from a pine tree that can greatly support your immune system and there improved immune system as well as improve cognitive and mood function as well and one last study i want to mention that was quite interesting there was even an improvement in iq with children that spent more time outside in the environment with more space more parks more trees more grass versus children that were living in the cities where they didn exposure to nature so anyway i wanted to create this video on the importance of getting your children outside the house having them play in nature also please comment down below on how much time did you spend outside when you were a child hey before you go if you content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below	Success
Intestinal Permeability or Leaky Gut	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hZdwP8rp8U	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let or leaky gut this is a situation where there are holes in your intestine and your food particles are getting into these holes into the lymphatic system and then your immune system is going to react to it you sorts of allergies you inflammation then you now i i that destroy your gut lining and that cause a leaky gut like gluten for example taking antibiotics consuming foods that are inflammatory but in this video i want to talk about another control mechanism that is superior to that and it is the vagus nerve the vagus nerve comes from the brain stem and it goes throughout the entire thorax into your abdomen it goes down into your pelvis and it nerve and you actually have two of them okay and 80 of that nerve goes down and only 20 goes up and so we have this huge communication network between our brain and our gut and so the vagus nerve helps to maintain this intestinal barrier to prevent pathogens and other things from crossing over into your body now they experiments on vagal nerve stimulation to show how that can protect the gut barrier now from my experience i don recommend stimulating your vagus nerve there they did find that when you stimulate the vagus nerve it actually protects this barrier this gut barrier also low vagal activity so when there your vagus nerve you have an increase in permeability and inflammation and so the vagus nerve is all a part of something called the autonomic nervous system the vagus nerve is part of the division called the parasympathetic and the parasympathetic is all about rest and digest and so this division of the autonomic nervous system also helps you secrete hydrochloric acid it helps you release enzymes from your pancreas it helps you release bile from your gallbladder it peristalsis that your colon it helps you prevent inflammation and also controls the valves of the stomach above the stomach and below the stomach and helping to prevent a condition called gerd and so the vex nerve has this protective function in the intestinal epithelial barrier now that but the question is what if we have a problem with the vagus nerve what is the best thing to do well there just happens to be a very key nutrient that supports the vagus nerve and that is thiamine and the question where does it come from it comes from grains but here consume grains grains have gluten and that will destroy the gut so you don want to get your b1 from grains in fact consuming grains creates a deficiency of b1 you want to get your b1 from nutritional yeast you can also get it from sunflower seeds if you have gut issues i think it to not neglect vitamin b1 in the control of intestinal permeability hey before you go if you content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below	Success

Low Blood Pressure and POTS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bZuxGDBq44	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we blood pressure and a few related conditions one being something called pots pot stands for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome now i know you know what posture means but what about this term orthostatic it term to describe upright posture so postural orthostatic hypotension is used to describe a condition where you lying down and then you stand up and your blood pressure drops but not only does your blood pressure drop your pulse rate starts going up you feel dizzy disoriented you can lose your sense of vision you can feel lightheaded fatigue nauseous blurred vision shakiness fainting and you can actually go unconscious now your normal blood pressure should be 120 over 80. now low blood pressure or hypotension is defined being the systolic number or the top number being less than 90 and the bottom or diastolic being less than 60. now i also want to mention when people go into shock the first thing that happens is their blood pressure drops right down and this could occur from being overheated over training loss of blood taking certain medications trauma and the list goes on and on but what i want to focus on in this video is mainly the mechanism of what occurs when you stand up and your blood pressure drops what you do about it so what are the possibilities well number one it could be that you just don enough blood in your body and that can come from various things internal bleeding another possibility could be that you that could be from low iron another common reason for not enough volume of blood in your body is you have enough salt salt helps you retain fluid and this can show up a couple ways number one just not consuming enough salt number two drinking excessive amount of water without the salt can severely dehydrate you because all this water is going to dilute the last bit of sodium you have and severely dehydrate you and so you can be dehydrated by consuming too much water without the salt the salt is there to help you retain the fluid one interesting point about this is when someone starts the ketogenic diet they lose a lot of fluid because they longer retaining fluid and so people when they start the ketogenic diet should actually consume a little more salt now if you are taking diuretics if you have vomiting if you have dehydration those could be other reasons why you don that can show up as low blood pressure all right so there want to talk about and that relates to something called the autonomic nervous system if your autonomic nervous system is not working right if it dysfunctional that could be the reason why your blood pressure drops when you stand up because the autonomic nervous system has everything to do with adapting your body to stress especially postural stresses so let example this is your body and you have your blood right and you lay down so when you stand up your your blood is going to pull to the bottom of your body and your legs right well what here if you don oxygen is you so the autonomic nervous system helps push or squeeze the blood up into your brain that autonomic nervous system is mainly located in the lower part of your brain called the brain stem and your brain stem is very sensitive to a b1 deficiency why because you need v1 to handle the massive oxygen that the brain requires to do its function b1 is like the spark plug in a carburetor where you oxygen and fuel without the b1 you won get that combustion and you won able to use the fuel in your brain so without b1 the brain doesn well and the autonomic nervous system does not work that well in fact even when you can have very similar symptoms to pots for example your pulse rate goes up you can have arrhythmias you get dizzy when you stand up now the way that someone becomes deficient in b1 is mainly through consuming refined carbohydrates and sugars they can also get it by consuming too many sulfites in red wine and also dried fruit also malabsorption so if you have a gut problem it could be that you able to absorb vitamin b1 and then also when you start the ketogenic diet the requirement for b1 goes way up and if you symptoms especially keto fatigue and also the more stress you have the more b1 you nutrient for the autonomic nervous system is vitamin d without vitamin d your autonomic nervous system is just not going to work that well so if you have pots if you have low blood pressure three things that i would focus on is more salt more b1 through nutritional yeast in more vitamin d3 hey before you go if you content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below	Success
EMF Exposure Is 10+ Hours per Day for an Average Person	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jK1PHNWnQ4w	Dr. Eric Berg DC	did you realize that the average person in the u.s is exposed to emfs for over 10 hours a day this really shocked me but if you look at it it does make sense because we your smartphones computers laptops wi-fi internet routers microwaves and the list goes on and these devices are putting out invisible electromagnetic fields that definitely interact with our own body electrical fields both in our brain in our heart and even in deep into the cell but the good news is this that experts assure us that emfs are not harmful there link between emfs and anything negative about your health but i don because there out in 2012 that evaluated 2 000 studies and they found that this low-level radiation can play a role not just in alzheimer a lot of different conditions it can affect your blood pressure it can affect your pulse rate it can cause you to have insomnia it can make you tired it can affect your cognitive function focus memory concentration it can actually raise your inflammation cause muscle aches and mood changes and even increase your risk for getting a stroke or a heart attack and it can cause dna damage other than that it the experts and so the emf waves affect the channels the communication channels in your cells they people know that calcium is involved with bone but they don calcium is the main mineral involved with communication through the membranes of every single cell and these emf energy waves directly affect the communication channels across all your cellular membranes so presently we are doing a huge experiment on the human population with emfs so i going to highly recommend doing three things number one you have to start limiting exposure to emf okay the way to do that is to get a emf tester i the one that i use it use and i explain how to use it and you just turn it on and you can measure three things individually the electrical fields and then separately the magnetic fields and i explain what that means in the videos down below but if you have one of these testers you can measure on your desk where you sleep and a fascinating experiment is to measure your microwave if you have one and you these microwaves transmit through your kitchen it scary actually and the next time you use your microwave you stand probably outside the room when you use it all right number two keep your cell phone and other devices away from your head okay do not do this keep it away from your head uh use your speaker phone i talked about certain type of external headphones or earphones that you can use that limit the amount of radiation that goes right up into your brain and then number three you want to increase your antioxidant network why because there oxidation a lot of free radical damage occurring when you emfs so you want to beef up no pun intended in your antioxidant network a lot of raw vegetables would help cruciferous vegetables healthier foods and fasting can all increase your antioxidant network that can help counter a lot of the emf effects from your daily exposure hey before you go if you from any of my content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below	Success

DHEA and Menopause	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY_GDsbvqXM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	i wanted to touch on a very important hormone called dhea as it relates to menopause there are definitely a lot of therapeutic benefits for men but i the benefits of using dhea for women now what is dhea it other words in your body you have a lot of different hormones and hormones can be made from proteins or cholesterol and so cholesterol is like a building block for steroid hormones so you have cholesterol which is a precursor for dhea and dhea is a precursor for estrogen androgens and a lot of the other steroid hormones now the other interesting thing about dhea is that it is one of the most abundant circulating steroids in the human body and because it other hormones when you get older dhea diminishes greatly it can drop to levels of 70 to 80 percent of what you had when you mean if you menopause well the older you get the less estrogen you less androgen you dhea is sold as a supplement you can get it over the counter it get it as a side note you can increase your dhea by exercising by fasting and calorie restriction having enough dhea also helps protect against insulin resistance so without dhea you can actually have higher amounts of insulin in the body and it can affect your weight your metabolism and many other things now i going to get into what dhea is used for but i want to make a special point you want to start out with very low amounts okay like between 10 milligrams and 30 milligrams per day why because if you take too much you can end up making too many androgens and if you androgens you want just the right amount so you may find that you oily skin hair growth through your body that you don you you usually can take a little bit more between 50 to 100 milligrams simply because your body has a lot more androgens than women okay so what is it used for it adrenal insufficiency so if you have adrenal problems like you don enough adrenal function uh there condition called addison adrenals aren this would be very beneficial and that is because dhea is made by your adrenals as well as the gonads ovaries and testicles all right it menopausal hormone therapy the third use is in treating painful sexual intercourse due to vaginal atrophy and the last benefit for females is it does increase your libido so if you want to try this make sure you start off with very small amounts and then gradually increase until you achieve your goal now one little point before you take dhea you don already have too much estrogen or too much androgen so if you have polycystic ovarian syndrome where you have too much androgen you don because you oily skin and more body hair all right thanks for watching and i will see you in the next video hey before you go if you content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below	Success

If You Have Acid Reflux, This is What You Should Know	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_UWDPrDR40	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today i want to talk about the most important things you need to know if you have acid reflux so i have this diagram of the stomach there top part and there lower part the valve on the top prevents acid and food from regurgitating up through the esophagus the valve in the bottom controls the food from the stomach into the small intestine as well as controlling the food and bile from regurgitating back up into the stomach so both of these valves are sphincters it controlled by the autonomic nervous system so the muscular control is kind of a gradual contraction and a gradual relaxation until it fully open and so the problem we have with these valves is they open at the wrong time or close at the wrong time we can have a big problem with acid and bile ending up in the wrong place now because they controlled by the autonomic nervous system that means that they influenced with this thing called stress and this is why there are so many digestive problems that can be affected by stress like acid reflux heartburn and the list goes on and on and on and so if you have acid reflux and a lot of stress you know you something to reduce that stress before it starts improving now the other thing that controls these sphincters is calcium calcium has the function of muscular contraction so it helps close these sphincters but most of the time people are lacking the vitamin that controls calcium i talking about vitamin d if you deficient in vitamin d you and the valve is not going to close fully and incidentally vitamin d also acts like cortisol in the body and there stress and by taking vitamin d that can actually help reduce your stress and can help directly close the valve just from the function of vitamin d itself now the other cause of this valve on the top of the stomach opening at the wrong time is because you don hydrochloric acid in your stomach apparently there are receptors or sensors in that valve for hydrochloric acid so we have the synchronization of food coming through the valve closing and acid increasing so you can get a complete digestion so if you don enough hydrochloric acid or the acid in your stomach is not acid enough that valve might not close and that can cause the regurgitation effect so what can cause a deficiency of hydrochloric acid well one is low chlorides as in low salt so if you not taking enough sea salt that could be the reason why you don hydrochloric acid also it takes potassium to also make hydrochloric acid so you need those electrolytes as the building blocks to make hydrochloric acid now another big cause of low hydrochloric acid is medication induced hypochlorhydria that is low stomach acid caused by antacids especially the ppis now there are also foods that actually can aggravate the situation gluten grains sugar of course alcohol and omega-6 fatty acids as in all the soy oil the canola oil the corn oil the cottonseed oil and of course all the processed foods and the junk foods those can not only disrupt the opening closing of the valves but they can also disrupt the production of hydrochloric acid let me first talk about the importance of hydrochloric acid okay number one its role in intestinal hormones you have all sorts of hormones that are involved in your digestion and your small intestine that secreted from the small intestine itself and without hydrochloric acid they can that are in the upper part of the digestive system they certain ph hydrochloric acid being an acid activates these enzymes so they can work all right number two hcl prepares folate and b12 for absorption number three hydrochloric acid helps the absorption of minerals i potassium zinc and iron all right number four hydrochloric acid is also necessary for something called the intrinsic factor for the absorption of b12 another mechanism of b12 absorption if you don have enough b12 you lot of neurological problems and a lot of pain from nerve damage all right next one is hcl is vital in the prevention of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth this is the prevention of bacteria growing in the small intestine that growing in the large colon not the small intestine and so without hydrochloric acid you can get sibo hcl is vital in preventing pathogens microbes that are unfriendly going through the stomach and invading the body so we need this hydrochloric acid to kill off unfriendly bacteria fungus viruses that are in our foods and also hcl is vital in preventing food allergies because we want to take this protein break it down fully into amino acids and so if it down your immune system can react to it and you can develop allergies all right so let me just touch briefly on the valve on the bottom part of the stomach okay and this valve is very important in preventing bile from regurgitating up into the stomach and then up into the esophagus bile can irritate the esophagus just as much as hydrochloric acid because it detergent and it can break down the mucous layer and create a lot of pain and irritation now there culprits or problems with that happening number one excess belly fat if you have too much visceral fat all that fat can put pressure up into this area and cause a regurgitation of bile back up into the stomach number two hiatal hernia and for more information about that i put a video down below so you can learn a real simple technique to help that condition and lastly if you have a gallbladder problem or you have bile sludge or even gallstones that obstructing the flow of bile that can create a backup bile into the system and the solution for that is purify bile salts all right so what are the very important things you need to do if you have acid reflux number one i would recommend starting out taking the tane hydrochloride methane hydrochloride is a really good remedy for acid reflux it increase the concentration of acid in your stomach and the problem with a lot of people when they take obtain hydrochloride is they think that one or two with a meal is going to solve it usually they maybe five six seven eight with a meal especially in the beginning and you would want to take it right before the meal and you improvement in the digestion of your food and a lessening of the backup of acid that also apple cider vinegar is very very important to add with that and you find great relief if you add both of those together now if you and apple cider vinegar and you feel worse it aggravates the problem that could mean you either have an ulcer or gastritis in which case you need to switch your plan of action and start taking chlorophyll or some organic raw wheatgrass juice powder so that can help heal the irritation in your esophagus and your stomach the best vegetable or even food for acid reflux is cabbage okay all forms of cabbage and even sauerkraut so make mental note of that all right number three very important reduce your stress do whatever you can to reduce your stress i have a thousand videos on how to do that all right number four intermittent fasting if you six small meals or eating frequently just think about what stressing the entire digestive system intermittent fasting the decrease of frequency of eating especially if you can do two meals or even one meal a day that your acid reflux why because it gives your digestive system a chance to reset and heal and not work so hard all right number five vitamin d i important to prevent acid reflux number six zinc l-carnosine is not only good for ulcers gastritis it acid reflux in fact zinc l-carnosine is good for anything that gastrointestinal tract and number seven taking a very good probiotic because if you have the microbes helping you digest in the lower part of your your system that part of the digestive system because they watching and i will see you in the next video hey before you go if you content i would love to

Male Version of PCOS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHbxjkV4TJY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let pcos what is pcos it stands for polycystic ovarian syndrome okay pcos is a condition in females where you have these follicle or cyst like things growing on the ovary and there is an excess amount of androgens being produced and these androgens create facial hair loss of hair on top of your head weight gain deeper voice and a very stubborn metabolism now pcos is driven largely by chronically elevated insulin okay this is called hyperinsulinemia okay too much insulin in your blood now what causes that too many carbs this is why the ketogenic diet is essential for pcos but in a male if we talk about the the equivalent of pcos in a man we androgenic alopecia this is male pattern baldness okay number two erectile dysfunction why because insulin destroys circulation in the vascular system and the last one is benign prostatic hypertrophy your prostate is getting too big and that is because insulin is a growth promoting factor it makes things get bigger so if you have any one of these and we them symptoms you know you have too much insulin and the most important test that doctors never do is a fasting insulin test and there called homa ir which measures as a part of that fasting insulin so if you have male pattern baldness a rectal dysfunction or an enlarged prostate definitely get the blood test homa ir or even a fasting insulin test and in the meantime if you want to see some amazing improvements i would recommend doing the healthy version of the ketogenic diet as well as intermittent fasting if you new to my channel i put a link down below of exactly how to do it hey before you go if you content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below	Success
Body Fat Location Can Predict Disease	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq9fCgPN5KE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you know when you look around uh at the difference between men and women one big difference is where they hold their fat so with women they have more what called subcutaneous fat the superficial layer underneath the skin and they have more deposits of fat and what is called the gluteal femoral and that because femoral femur that thighs and then you have gluteal which is the butt area and the wraps around the hips but with men they don hold their fat as much subcutaneously they hold it more viscerally in the gut right and what determines where they hold the weight is the level of estrogen they have as far as the risk factors to other problems whether or not the subcutaneous fat which is caused by estrogen is more protective against some of these metabolic diseases visceral fat is way more dangerous because it puts you at risk for heart disease diabetes inflammation insulin resistance a fatty liver and metabolic diseases which is diabetes high blood pressure etc and so women have less risk factors for getting all these conditions due to the amount of estrogen until they reach menopause where this risk factor then is now equal to a man why because of the drop in estrogen now your fat tissue called adipose tissue is glandular it produces hormone it is a storage for fuel it has many other functions and so when you get insulin resistance you can have insulin resistance of different tissues you can have insulin resistance of your liver you can have insulin resistance in your muscles in your fat cells which then can impair the function of your fat cell now what cell is not holding or accepting the fat anymore you get this spillover effect which this fat then becomes something called ectopic which means it no longer goes in the adipose tissue it goes in other organs around organs in between organs and then this causes more dysfunction in the gland and it can also worsen insulin resistance so you have insulin resistance which increases insulin which is causing more fat to be in your liver and other organs and then you have the fat and the organs in the liver actually causing insulin resistance so both of these situations are feeding each other now if you read some of the research on this they recommend the solution being you need to lose weight okay and many times they don actually mention going on a low carb diet which is quite interesting they just focus on the losing weight but if you try to lose weight without lowering your carbohydrates you going to fully resolve this insulin resistance problem because insulin is the main storage for fat insulin is the main hormone that determines whether you going to burn fat or not because when insulin goes up your body is going to then prevent the loss or the burning of that fat i wouldn just losing weight i would focus on primarily getting your insulin down fixing insulin resistance to do that the best way is to do healthy keto and intermittent fasting and for that information i put the link down below check it out hey before you go if you content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below	Success

Sinus Infection (Sinusitis): 2 Natural Remedies	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APePm9y0F74	Dr. Eric Berg DC	all right let some relief with a sinus infection or sinusitis especially if it it it and there could also be something called biofilms biofilms are little calcium houses or igloos that protect the bacteria or other types of microbes from being destroyed by an antibiotic so there are some things to inhibit the formation of biofilms as well as kill the fungus naturally without the side effects and i irrigation or nasal rinse you can make your own but it going to be a lot less expensive just to buy one with the ingredients in it i want to mention something about kimchi juice i will put the link down below but there just so happens to be a very specific microbe in this fermented uh korean uh product which is very effective of clearing out mucus and infections in your sinuses and you could take a little bit of that juice dilute it and with a little q-tip just each day put some up in your nose and that can actually repopulate this microbe and so then you have this normal balance of the friendly bacteria that can help prevent the pathogens and the unfriendly yeast and fungus that can grow you see when you take an antibiotic you kill off the bacteria but you don fungus in your gut this is why the biggest side effect from an antibiotic is an overgrowth of a fungus which is called candida same thing in the sinuses when you kill off the bacteria you get this overgrowth of this fungus okay the two main ingredients that i would recommend in a nasal rinse and you can get these online there can probably get one at the drugstore but the point is that these are the two ingredients that i in this nasal rinse which isn solution okay so number one xylitol this is one of my favorite sugars it sugar alcohol actually so it on the glycemic index i usually have this in my one cup of coffee a day i have a small cup but xylitol tastes pretty close to sugar but it doesn have the spike of blood sugars but it has some other properties it can decrease the formation of biofilms so it in a gum and chew it because it can actually reduce the bathrooms in your mouth which then inhibits the formation of plaquing and tartar and things like that in your mouth but xylitol also suppresses the growth of fungus okay so xylitol would be a really good ingredient in this nasal rinse and then grapefruit seed extract quite amazing it anti-fungal very powerful antibacterial it antibiotics and 18 fungicides with slightly less side effects and i sarcastic because i don any side effects but the combination of these two would be a great remedy in a nasal rinse to use if you have this chronic sinus infection or this mucus or stuffy nose that you have year-round now baby shampoo this has been studied and what they taken one percent of this baby shampoo in a saline solution so you taking much you drop in some salt water and you can put this in the nasal rinse as well and this also can inhibit biofilms in other words you have some options you could actually just buy one of these nasal rinse empty bottles get some saline solution and put a a drop of this in there if you wanted and start to irrigate your sinuses anyway i just wanted to give you a good remedy if you have a sinus issue and you want something pretty effective all right thanks for watching so if you hope you are and you your health and you have a success i appreciate you sharing your success story so click the link down below to my website where you can upload your success story so you can help inspire others	Success
Why Your Good Bacteria Make Bile Salts - OKAY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9Lhk14fGSE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let microbes have to make bile too so the bile that bile that from your liver and stored in your gall bladder\\xa0\\nis then released when you eat to help you break\\xa0\\xa0 down fats and help you extract the fat soluble\\xa0\\nvitamins from the food as well as the omega-3\\xa0\\xa0 fatty acids and other beneficial fatty acids so\\xa0\\nthe bile acts as like this detergent to break\\xa0\\xa0 down this grease to a certain level and then\\xa0\\nthe pancreas releases an enzyme called lipase\\xa0\\xa0 to take it down to even a smaller level so then\\xa0\\nyour small intestine can absorb it but in your gut\\xa0\\xa0 bile is made for a slightly different purpose now\\xa0\\nnormally you want the majority of your microbes\\xa0\\xa0 in your large intestine not the small intestine\\xa0\\nbecause if these microbes start to invade the\\xa0\\xa0 small intestine you start getting this overgrowth\\xa0\\nof bacteria and then you start getting competition\\xa0\\xa0 for the nutrients that are supposed to be absorbed\\xa0\\nin the small intestine so 90 of all the absorption\\xa0\\xa0 of nutrients is in the small intestine as well\\xa0\\nas the pancreas but the bile in the intestine has\\xa0\\xa0 a slightly different purpose it invading the small intestine because that\\xa0\\ncondition is called sibo small intestinal\\xa0\\xa0 bacterial overgrowth and it in the wrong place which means you food that comes into your body and the nutrients\\xa0\\nas well and so the bile in your large intestine\\xa0\\xa0 called the secondary bile is antibacterial it\\xa0\\nhelps regulate the type of bacteria it also helps\\xa0\\xa0 protect the liver it helps reduce inflammation but\\xa0\\nthe main thing it does is it helps to prevent the\\xa0\\xa0 bacteria from growing in the small intestine so\\xa0\\nthat being said there inhibit this process from happening and having you\\xa0\\nend up being bile deficient number one every time\\xa0\\xa0 you take antibiotics you kill off the friendly\\xa0\\nbacteria so if you don a situation also the lack of fiber if you to feed the microbes enough so they might not\\xa0\\nproduce enough bile that you could be deficient in bile also if you has glyphosate which kills off microbes that could\\xa0\\nbe another situation and then lastly if you a low-fat diet see fat especially saturated fat\\xa0\\nstimulates the production and release of bile\\xa0\\xa0 and so if you	Success
Best Exercise for Telomere Length	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rl9dZ5svj0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	i wanted to create this video on the best exercise that you can do to increase your telomeres now what telomere a telomere is like this protective coating on the end of your chromosomes to protect your genes and the significance of this is that the longer the telomeres the longer you potentially can live and so there whole series of epigenetic things that you can do to keep these telomeres very very high and i different foods and remedies that you can take but in this video we to talk specifically about exercise so based on the data so far physical activity in general despite the type of exercise is associated with longer telomeres so in other words the more active you are the longer you to live so the next point is this there was a significant association with robust and moderate exercise and i mainly talking about high intensity interval training okay that intense workout but of short duration and aerobic endurance training both of those types of exercise show significant association with an increased telomere length now the reason why that is is because you decreasing oxidative stress you actually getting your body into a situation where it handle more oxidative stress oxidative stress and inflammation are two things that really mess up your genes and both of these exercises do reduce inflammation but in this study there was a subgroup of exercise which is just aerobic exercise so it wasn short workout of aerobic exercise and another category called resistance training both of these subcategories did not show an association with increased telomere length however there resistance training improving cardiovascular function decreasing risk of dying from a heart attack and other reasons why you might die all right thanks for watching so if you hope you are and you your health and you have a success i would really appreciate you sharing your success story so click the link down below to my website where you can upload your success story so you can help inspire others	Success
What Color Is Your Phlegm (Mucus)?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMx33GqFspc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so i have a question for you what color is your phlegm now that question first of all what is phlegm well phlegm is mucus that is originating from your respiratory system usually something from the lungs not necessarily from your sinuses and then when you cough it up that called sputum and your body actually makes about one liter of this phlegm every single day so there that have an infection it can be a lot more now let through the different colors of phlegm just so you can get a ballpark idea of what could be going on if the phlegm is white or clear that could indicate more allergies or asthma if it that usually indicates a mild infection and if it severe infection now if it like almost black that can be a fungal infection brown phlegm could be more of a lung disease if it usually because the person now if it suspect blood and that could come from the nose coming down that could be because the air is too dry or it could be a vitamin c deficiency where the capillaries are fragile or it could be even a vitamin d deficiency now there is a rare chance that there could be a lung cancer involved or it could indicate a tb infection so if it bacterial infection usually it takes between 10 and 14 days if it a little bit longer but if you wanted to thin this mucus or phlegm and try to extract as much as possible there three remedies i number one zinc at least 50 milligrams number two vitamin d at least 10 000 ius of vitamin d3 and one of the best herbs to use in this situation is called fenugreek and this can act as a very powerful expectorant to get rid of this mucus all right thanks for watching so if you hope you are and you your health and you have a success i would really appreciate you sharing your success story so click the link down below to my website where you can upload your success story so you can help inspire others	Success

Use Probiotics for Acid Reflux	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H-lDiFpW3w	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now there link or association between using probiotics in improving acid reflux or heartburn but the question is why how can a probiotic that affects the gut bacteria affect the stomach in one study i read 79 percent of people who took probiotics benefited from their acid reflux symptom so there probiotics might help you one is that you have to look at the digestive system as one whole connecting organ or system and as you affect one part of it the other parts are affected so one type of bacteria we have is the lactic acid bacteria and this bacteria actually acidifies a colon then you also have lactic acid yeast which acidifies the colon as well so these microbes help you digest and the more you have complete digestion in the lower part the better it be for the upper part like the stomach if you don large intestine that can also lead to an overgrowth of bacteria in your small intestine called sibo and that can also back up the whole system where you get regurgitation of fluids like for example lactic acid coming from the small intestine up into the stomach you can also have bile reflux or regurgitation coming up in the stomach and then you can also have hydrochloric acid that backs up into the esophagus simply because you don your large intestine in the lower part now the other point i want to bring up is this gut brain axis or this relationship between your brain in your gut it called the vagus nerve and the vagus nerve is bidirectional okay so in other words it communicates going up this way and communicates going down this way so whatever your brain and whatever happens up here can affect your gut now the unique thing about the vagus nerve is that it is part of the autonomic nervous system specifically the parasympathetic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system controls all of the valves in the body as in the valves on top of your stomach and the valves on the bottom of your stomach which regulate the amount of food that goes through these different passages and one way that people have a problem with the vagus nerve is you have some type of dysbiosis or some type of problem in the lower part of your gut in the large bowel now the other connection is that if you one of the big side effects is gerd and acid reflux which are pretty much the same thing so what do antibiotics do they destroy your flora if you don don severely affect the stomach it can even give you gastritis or a sour stomach now the microbes in your large intestine also make bile salts so if there that that can also affect the neutralization of this acid coming into the small intestine because bile salts are alkaline and so if you don enough alkalinity that can throw things off and so you can then have more of an acid effect in your small intestine which could not just create ulcers but it can back up and create ulcers in the stomach and lead to an acid reflux situation so this is what i recommend if you have acid reflux or if you have heartburn i recommend consuming apple cider vinegar obtain hydrochloride which are both acidifiers that can many times help the stomach but you also may need some probiotics and a few natural good ones are kefir make sure it with added sugar make sure it milk kefir another one is sauerkraut my favorite and kimchi which is a fermented cabbage product usually eaten by koreans and actually many other people alright thanks for watching i will see you in the next video so if you hope you are and you your health and you have a success i would really appreciate you sharing your success story so click the link down below to my website where you can upload your success story so you can help inspire others	Success
High Pulse Rate Keeping You From Sleep?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YndOK6L44ik	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you know your sleeping problem could be happening because your pulse rate is just too high so in this video i why your pulse rate could be too high number one it could be a vitamin b1 deficiency which a lot of times comes from a high carb diet there causes and i but if you you could have a higher pulse rate all right number two at potassium deficiency potassium is a physiological tranquilizer it calms the nervous system down if you your pulse rate will tend to be on the high side and also your blood pressure will also be on the high side and so what can create a potassium deficiency well it could be you consuming enough potassium so you need to consume more salads because if you start having bigger salads like at least seven cups a day you more potassium and magnesium which is another mineral to help calm things down also a high carb diet will cause a potassium deficiency too much acid so if you tachycardia or it can raise your pulse rate i remember consuming um a whole bottle of kombucha tea right before bed and my pulse rate was like so that number four stress if you that can raise cortisol or adrenaline i have a lot of videos on that so i that link down below but cortisol and adrenaline can keep your pulse rate too high i mean try to sleep if you in a stress situation or you chased by a tiger next one is over training if you exercise too much that can keep your pulse rate up and that really has a lot to do with number seven which is an autonomic nervous system dysfunction if you parasympathetic nervous system the recovery system and you sympathetic dominant and you exercise too much that good combination so what you need to be doing is long walks and you need to restore the autonomic nervous system by more vitamin b1 that will help but over training is a thing that can definitely keep your pulse rate higher i remember in practice one time i had this lady come in and i i told her to exercise in my clinic because we had a little gym and her pulse rate went up to 158 she comes back the next day paul strait was still at 158 and i tested her and she had no parasympathetic nervous system which is the recovery system it actively pushes your pulse right down so that was a good lesson for me that you really want to check the person before you have them exercise especially if it exercise number six a hot flash will increase your pulse rate number eight certain medications will increase your pulse rates anemia is another thing that can increase your pulse rate next one is a hyperthyroid situation and by the way if you have hyperthyroidism and you take b1 that can help with that condition 11. either you have high blood sugars or a low blood sugar situation that can increase your pulse rate i have a lot of videos on both of those conditions and 12 and i should have put this higher up on this list but a gallbladder problem if you start the ketogenic diet and you have a gallbladder problem and you add all this fat to the diet and you don have enough bile salts because of various situations it could overload the gallbladder and create more sludge within the gallbladder system and i talking about a gallstone i talking about a backup into the bile ducts which creates pressure in the liver which is right next to the heart and that can create a pulse rate situation so if you start keto and you all this extra fat from these keto bombs or you you just consume the fat that normally comes with the protein until you can build up that bile reserve and at the same time take some good gallbladder support and i more information on that all right so let you can do if you the fat take bile salts number one number two increase your potassium and magnesium from the foods or salads and you can also get it in electrolyte powder as well number three decrease the amount of protein if you and make sure it protein okay because too much protein connect as a stimulant and that can rev up the engine and especially if you deficient in potassium you can actually prevent someone sleep by having too much protein all right number four tone down the amount of exercise you the intensity of exercise if you to not do crossfit because your recovery might be too low number five cut down some of the caffeine i always recommend just doing one cup of coffee per day if i do more than one cup of coffee and i talking like a small cup that will affect my sleep so watch the caffeine on that number six low carb number seven go on long walks in nature very important and number eight regulate your breathing so when you at night you may find that your breathing is erratic or you stress mode with this breathing so really slow down and regulate the breathing in and out so the inhalation is the same as the exhalation and focus on that you can even focus on your stomach coming out your stomach coming in and that breathing and that will tend to help you actually control the autonomic nervous system because you actively affecting your breathing which then can affect that part of the nervous system all right thanks for watching so if you hope

Craving Salt After Eating Sweets? Here's Why	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbeJTLjgOIA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now if you this video is probably not for you but it eat carbohydrates because we know you are on the ketogenic diet so if you have friends and family that are not on the ketogenic diet you can show them this video but the question is why do people crave salt after they eat sweet or even after they eat some carbohydrate we so let not you eat some cake drink some soda eats candy cookies a donut ice cream and then later that day or night start craving some salt they need some chips right they need something salty why is that because when you start getting high blood glucose there much sugar in the blood sodium starts leaking out of your cells because of what glucose does to the cell it osmotic which i don the details on the mechanism but just realize that when you have high glucose in your blood you tend to lose sodium in certain places in the body and you also become deficient in potassium so you have hyponatremia which is low sodium and hypokalemia which is low potassium now the symptom of low sodium would be you crave salt and you can actually develop a headache or have adrenal stress you can feel more stress and this is why sometimes when people eat more salt they they feel calm they can actually relax and their cravings go away their headaches go away at least for a minute but what are the cravings for low potassium there is none you a big salad after this event are you usually not because there cravings when you even though you should be consuming a high potassium food like a big salad people don the ratio of sodium to potassium should be one to two you should always have twice as much potassium so here then they eat the salt they satisfy this but they don when you actually just have more salt without the potassium you create even more of a deficiency of potassium if you look at the ratios and then all sorts of other things will happen you may get palpitations you may feel this loud pounding in the ear inner ear like your heartbeat is like that on the pillow when you sleep you sleeping because potassium is a physiological tranquilizer it relaxes you potassium also gives you energy so you may feel fatigue you may feel out of breath when you also is involved with preventing leg cramps because it it things so for those of you that are on carbs you don potassium to take that either in a supplement or an electrolyte or just a large salad but for those of you that are regularly watching my videos you don thing because you you right here because you healthy version of keto but if you not on keto and you want to know how to do this i put a link down below and i explain exactly how to do the healthy version of keto and in a minute fasting so if you which i hope you are and you your health and you have a success i appreciate you sharing your success story so click the link down below to my website where you can upload your success story so you can help inspire others	Success
The Real Reason for a Vitamin D Deficiency	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0AmWd57pfg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let deficient in vitamin d and why is it so hard to get vitamin d well number one it get vitamin d from your diet unless you have fatty fish every single day so this is why we rely on the sun well let you can get from the sun well 10 minutes of the sun can provide a thousand international units right actually a thousand international units is very tiny but you get this 1000 i use only if you live close to the equator okay and if you the more difficult it is to penetrate through the skin apparently the skin becomes thicker and if you have in your body the less penetration sun has to your skin and if you have more light colored skin the darker the skin the more the melanin the less vitamin d gets through the skin and if it lying down versus standing up if you standing up the sun rays kind of get the top of your head but they don and of course you have to have a healthy liver and enough bile to be able to break down this fat soluble vitamin and don you can and you can with your vitamin d receptor which by the way is more common than you might think and also if you don problems any inflammation any past gut problems because inflammation blocks the absorption of vitamin d and lastly if there and you have a gallbladder the microbes the friendly bacteria in your gut make a secondary type of bile which helps you absorb vitamin d so number one we need enough bacteria to make secondary bile as well as the gall bladder to be able to store and concentrate this bile to help you break down this fat soluble nutrient so this is why so many people are deficient and it very difficult to get enough vitamin d unless you don issues right here so if you hope you are and you your health and you have a success i appreciate you sharing your success story so click the link down below to my website where you can upload your success story so you can help inspire others	Success
Is Your Cell Phone Causing Sweet Cravings Late at Night?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNzFW7nZCLg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you know here you are you give up sugar and you but you carbs late at night what well i stumbled on a research paper that is very interesting because sweet cravings could come from something other than your diet and i videos on this but i have never made the link between your cell phone specifically the blue light from your cell phone but not just the smartphone you have the tablet your computer tv anything that emits blue light so blue light apparently goes into the retina of your eye which is an extension of your brain goes into the brain into the hypothalamus and starts to affect your circadian rhythms the pineal gland which then interacts with your adrenal gland and the liver and many other organs so what is the relationship between blue light and your blood sugars well it melatonin number one and number two it spikes cortisol which then affects your blood sugars due to stress so both of those actions can actually release more sugar and cause your body to make more sugar even though you sugar and so the sugar comes up insulin comes in after pushes the blood sugar down you end up with low blood sugars late at night after about an hour being exposed to this blue light so if you up sugar and you things try this you can get an app on your computer to filter out this blue light you can actually wear glasses that filter out the blue light because it the exposure to the retina or you can do what i do about two hours before i go to bed i at all or you can use a red light which does not affect your melatonin your sleep cycles your circadian rhythm cortisol or anything it so give it a try and see if your cravings don so if you hope you are and you your health and you have a success i appreciate you sharing your success story so click the link down below to my website where you can upload your success story so you can help inspire others	Success
What Zinc Dosage Should You Use? - OKAY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mujEPQh2vsc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let the question what dosage should you be consuming now the daily values for zinc are anywhere between 8 and 15 milligrams for adults and then it goes down from there ages 14 to 18 9 to 11 milligrams if you old it if you years it you two milligrams now a couple things you need to know about zinc number one you don consuming it you deficient especially within about four days many things can prevent the absorption of zinc number one phytates okay so when people consume a lot of grains like cereal or breads and things like that they getting a lot of phytic acid and that going to prevent the absorption of certain trace minerals especially zinc now if you have gi issues let have inflammation let crohn celiac ibs you time absorbing zinc so you more now if you you that can block zinc and the other factor is the bioavailable zinc that in animal products it vegetarian products so if you are a vegetarian i would definitely take it as a supplement now when you consume alcohol you you have an infection you use a lot more zinc because your immune system needs zinc zinc is needed in over a hundred different enzymes from my viewpoint it is the most important trace mineral of any trace mineral and so the best forms dietary is animal meats like red meat oysters shellfish organ meats like liver eggs you to get the best absorption if you get it from animal products now let you take too much most the symptoms from a toxicity point of view is actually a deficiency of copper because copper and zinc work together when you increase too much zinc you deplete your copper so the symptoms of a zinc overload would be neurological numbness tingling neuropathies things like that you might feel nauseous you might have diarrhea you also might have vomiting so i just recommend if you longer period of time or in large amounts take it within a blend of other trace minerals especially copper so that way you won are deficient or going through any infection or you have gi issues i definitely would recommend taking larger amounts even up to 200 milligrams to 250 milligrams per day as a short-term solution to what you infection because even though the body will only absorb seven to ten milligrams every time you consume it and maybe up to 40 milligrams there preventing the absorption so you might want to take larger amounts to bypass these other barriers of absorption if you zinc especially with a child or an infant you can have impaired growth other big symptoms of zinc deficiency would be erectile dysfunction because it affects your testosterone it lowers your testosterone you can have diarrhea many many children around the world die of diarrhea because you electrolytes because they deficient why because they with a lot of phytic acid another zinc deficiency symptom would be hair loss your tongue can become swollen you have a lowered immunity making you susceptible to getting a virus loss of taste loss of smell loss of appetite all right there you go thanks for watching	Success
98 Percent of Sleep Apnea Cases Have Low Vitamin D	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHL2s-FT5B8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let realize that 98 of people with sleep apnea have low vitamin d according to a study that i just read which i below so sleep apnea or obstructive sleep apnea which is known as osa is majorly linked with a low vitamin d situation so we okay so vitamin d significantly reduces inflammation and i back of the throat as well as in the back of the sinuses many times those tissues are inflamed and that can be the reason why you can also vitamin d supports an overactive immune system and many times when you have an overactive immune system you have certain parts of your body certain tissues that are inflamed the sinuses the back of the throat and even the lungs and that can abstract your breathing and then vitamin d also has a direct effect on your sleep cycles it helps you get into a deep restful rejuvenating sleep it helps support the delta wave of your sleep which is the deeper levels of sleep and without sleep you just don just want to differentiate between the type of vitamin d in this video i talking about vitamin d3 not vitamin d2 there d2 can actually create insomnia so you always want to make sure you take vitamin d3 so deficiency in vitamin d affects both sleep apnea and your sleep quality in general without vitamin d you which is going to keep you up at night i mean try to sleep with low back pain it also snoring is linked to a vitamin d deficiency i mean snoring can actually wake you up by itself and if your spouse is deficient in vitamin d and they snowing that can keep you up and then i also mentioned less delta wave sleep the delta wave is where you get this nice deep rejuvenating sleep and without vitamin d it into that delta wave sleep now without vitamin d your stress levels are higher your mood is usually lower and you with more stress without vitamin d your cortisol levels will be off and without proper cortisol balance that can affect your sleep as well cortisol is a stress hormone and too much cortisol keeps you in this flight or fight mode and also if you don might tend to grind your teeth which can affect your sleep cycles as well probably because you have this internal stress that you fully relax i always recommend taking vitamin d with magnesium because magnesium not only helps the absorption of vitamin d but it can prevent leg and foot cramps at night which can also keep you up and lastly vitamin d is majorly associated with insulin resistance so if you have insulin resistance first of all you to absorb vitamin d very well and if you have low vitamin d your chances of developing insulin resistance go up because vitamin d is essential in maintaining the beta cell of your pancreas that cell that produces insulin and vitamin d helps keep the free radicals and the oxidation at a very low state in that beta cell so in other words to keep this to a short video if you have sleep problems or sleep apnea just start taking more vitamin d and i would recommend a minimum of 10 000 ius of vitamin d right before you go to sleep and make sure you take magnesium with it so if you hope you are and you your health and you have a success i appreciate you sharing your success story so click the link down below to my website where you can upload your success story so you can help inspire others	Success
Zinc Absorption Basics - OKAY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j1vIAx88XU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	i recently did a video on zinc bioavailability and there all right so 1.1 billion people on this planet are deficient in zinc so this is an important topic to really cover so people can really understand why what for most people that are deficient in zinc it is usually because they consuming enough zinc from their diet but there deficient as well i talked about this in my other video gut issues insulin resistance but also prolonged stress if you have high levels of stress over a period of time you deficient in zinc and by taking zinc you can actually lower your cortisol levels okay then you also have a high carb diet and that includes the majority of people on this planet high amounts of carbs and sugar deplete your zinc then we have hormone replacement therapy and both estrogen and progesterone can deplete your zinc and also estrogen dominance can cause you to use up more zinc when you eat food that has zinc you and 40 percent of the zinc from food so if you have a ton of zinc you absorbing 20 to 40 percent of the zinc that food and the same goes with beef and lamb poultry cheese and shrimp zinc is absorbed in the middle part of your small intestine and with certain amounts of zinc if you milligrams you called active transport which means that there has to be some shuttle or carrier that shuttles the zinc from the small intestine to the blood okay it like a carrier type transport system but when you go over 40 milligrams those receptors become saturated so we no longer have this active transport we have what so if the subway for example is jammed up and there people in the subway then people start to spill over and start walking down the street to get where they need to go and that transport where there it just kind of spreads out and gets into the blood through other means and that happens when you consume more than 40 milligrams of zinc now there certain circumstances where you should be taking higher amounts of zinc okay and that that inflammation let or you just have a lot of arthritis something like that or let those are three scenarios where you should be taking more zinc and some people take 100 200 300 they might start having certain symptoms zinc toxicity symptoms okay now these symptoms are not permanent they don occur in everyone and some people need a lot more zinc to penetrate some of these barriers like a weak immune system like scar tissue in your intestine like severe insulin resistance so they need more but you should be aware of the symptoms like feeling nauseated vomiting diarrhea abdominal cramping headaches more inflammation fatigue lethargy anemia a decrease in hdl an increase in ldl realize that some of these symptoms could be coming from a copper deficiency or even an iron deficiency this is why i always recommend taking zinc within a base of all the trace minerals but at least taking copper because zinc and copper work together but realize if you get these symptoms they you have to do is cut the amounts that you away some of the forms of zinc that are better on the gut than others and by the way these forms of zinc that i to tell you about you and 80 okay so it so zinc citrate zinc glycerate zinc mono methionine zinc sulfate zinc by glycinate chelate then we have zinc ascorbate zinc amino acid chelate zinc gluconate and zinc acetate so just wanted to give you some additional data on the absorption of zinc stay tuned for more videos	Success
Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgU9wbRtsNA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder pmdd that those of you that have it it can be devastating but i even though this is a major problem for people if you understand what so freaking easy to get rid of all right what is pmdd it you have bloating headache breast tenderness and anxiety depression and a lot of other symptoms now the medical profession is treating this sometimes like a mental disorder it the dsm 5 which is the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders which to me is just a bunch of descriptive terms for symptoms of pms and pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder sounds very very scientific but the whole goal is to get someone to manage it then you have these support groups right i used to when i was in practice i did all these different seminars at different support groups the fibromyalgia support group the chronic fatigue syndrome support group the arthritis support group the peripheral neuropathy support group and i always hated going to these groups because it was really weird you would do a demonstration on someone you get instant results and you would think everyone would just line up and want help but it was very strange a lot of these people in this group got very upset when you got rid of their problem i don when you try to help someone and they actually might get upset when you try to help them so i always made it a policy that i only going to help people that want help and if you obviously you click the button and you want help but then you go research on kindle to find these books on pmdd and they information but no really good information that things it problem more comfortably but the question is how do we correct this so what imbalance situation usually you have this estrogen dominant situation but it estrogen dominant problem estrogen is low but progesterone is severely low giving you the appearance of an estrogen dominant because of the ratios both estrogen and progesterone work reciprocally just like potassium and magnesium so if you have too little of one the other one to be more dominant so here you need to avoid all dairy milk cheese yogurt completely eliminate this because that can actually throw up your hormones all right number two you need to start consuming cruciferous vegetables cruciferous vegetables have a lot of phytoestrogens in them which help to regulate your estrogens so if you lacking some of the good estrogens it give you more of that if you have too much of the bad estrogen it will lower that or you can take a product called dim which is a concentrated version of a certain phytonutrient in cruciferous vegetables all right number three sea kelp sea kelp is awesome for estrogen problems it for things like fibrocystic breast problem or breast tenderness but the iodine in seek help helps to regulate imbalances in estrogen all right and number four this is a must vitamin d but it you take 2 000 international units of vitamin d you need to take at least 10 000 to 20 000 iu day vitamin d is a great anti-inflammatory but it calcium and that so go ahead and apply these four things and then comment down below on how fast you so if you hope you are and you your health and you have a success i appreciate you sharing your success story so click the link down below to my website where you can upload your success story so you can help inspire others	Success

Stevia Kills Lyme Pathogen: New Study	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGl2CDWHvzA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	this is a very interesting topic and i put the study down below but there stevia using the whole leaf has the ability to kill the pathogen that causes lyme disease i mean this is huge now lyme disease is caused by a spiral kite spirochite is a spiral bacteria that you get infected from a tick and not everyone gets lyme disease certain people that have a lowered immune system get lyme disease and by the way if you have the bullseye rash it doesn limes but antibiotics are the primary treatment for lyme the problem is they don you develop a resistance to the antibiotic and the problem is when you come off the antibiotic things get worse you relapse so sometimes you have to stay in the antibiotics for a very very long time now this microbe has been around for eons and has developed defense mechanisms to survive and so if your immune system is healthy it your body and it sometimes as a biofilm which are like little igloos of calcium little houses that they live in that that allow them to live under the radar so your immune system cannot see them and so they go dormant for years waiting until a desirable environment occurs they out until you get older sickly where your immune system is shot then they come out and kick you when you compared to three different antibiotics showed a significant effect compared to these antibiotics also stereo was able to eliminate the spirochite as well as the biofilms now i will say this was not in a human study yet but this is very promising so it wouldn limes now because the problem is when you take an antibiotic antibiotics increase biofilms they lower your immune system so there are many things you can take to help combat lyme as far as natural remedies and i but let so if you hope you are and you your health and you have a success i would really appreciate you sharing your success story so click the link down below to my website where you can upload your success story so you can help inspire others	Success
Fix Your Nasty Bad Breath!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AolW2szNfNc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now a person with bad breath is usually the last person to know they have bad breath how do we know that because they your face without too much awareness on their bad breath i have some very uh interesting information that you probably haven very very important especially related to breath you see just like in my other videos if you want to know the truth about health just find out what everyone recommending and do the opposite or finding out what they to do and do it and this definitely applies to bad breath so before i get into that point i want to first talk about certain foods that can cause bad breath so you have garlic onions both of those foods are loaded with sulfur compounds so eating anything with sulfur can definitely give you a certain odor so if your spouse or partner eats anything with garlic or onions unless you eating things with garlic and onions it then you have cheese there of stinky cheese limburger cheese for example or blue cheese which has mold in it will all contribute to some pretty nasty breath but when you ask someone like when i ask my father why do you eat limburger cheese it smells so bad apparently it doesn smells bad so i first want to talk about some real simple things you can do to counter your bad breath if you foods with garlic onion cheese etc one thing that works really good to counter the bad breath is green tea you can use it as a mouthwash you can drink it it seems to counter the sulfur compounds in certain foods now the other thing that organic parsley and mint or peppermint and then when you have garlic or onions just take a little bit out of your refrigerator and chew on it it completely neutralizes the bad taste and the smell that you would get from eating those foods now another type of toothpaste that i like to recommend especially if someone has bad breath is toothpaste with clove and there different combinations with with clove with cardamom they to even act as a natural antibiotic without killing the good bacteria now this leads me right into a very important topic that so many people have no idea that creating a big problem with their breath and that is using toothpaste with fluoride and using a mouthwash with alcohol you see there that is either not understood that area of oral health which is this in your mouth you have hundreds of different species of microbes growing okay in your mouth and as far as a quantity we billions of microbes now we want them mostly friendly but you have two different groups you have the unfriendly ones and you have the friendly ones so when you talk about fluoride in your toothpaste right that kills the germs that might cause plaque that can then cause bad breath or when you about mouthwash that kills the germs that cause bad breath what about the good germs that prevent bad breath it not that you just have these bad germs in your mouth that are causing bad breath and then you can sterilize your mouth and everything same logic is taking an antibiotic thinking that you infection when you off all of the microbes that are supposed to protect you against infections and this reasoning has led to antibiotic resistance a massive amount of overgrowth of unfriendly bacteria and yeast and an overgrowth of candida oral thrush or a white tongue where you have too much unfriendly yeast that is giving you some pretty bad breath so fluoride and chloride in your water combined as you this water in your mouth is basically killing both the good and bad bacteria so it might give you a nice breath initially but then it ends up being bad breath so i would recommend getting toothpaste without the fluoride i would recommend also getting a water filter and i would definitely avoid the mouthwashes with alcohol because alcohol kills microbes i mean think about a sanitizer with rubbing alcohol that viruses and bacteria what do you think it there well you can actually get some gum with xylitol xylitol is a sugar alcohol that is very selective in what it kills off it won it only apparently kills off certain bad bacteria that cause plaque the bad bacteria that causes plaque apparently gives off a certain gas that is kind of stinky so that would be one thing you can do another thing to do as a natural deodorizer is to consume things with chlorophyll now what would that be that would be all the green stuff in plants as in vegetables okay i think one of the best sources of chlorophyll would be the wheatgrass juice powder that stuff has some serious chlorophyll and it your mouth but internally okay all the organs including the intestine all right the next point i want to bring up is coffee and coffee breath that can be quite nasty now that because the sulfur compounds in coffee beans as well as certain acids that occur in the coffee bean including cannons which can really dry out your mouth and affect your the microbiome in your mouth so of course with coffee breath you want to brush your teeth with some really good toothpaste that has clove and it doesn have fluoride but chewing parsley and mint is also a really good thing all right i already mentioned a little bit about alcohol but it alcohol mouthwash it in alcohol beverages so if you drink alcohol every so often just make sure that you don consume more than a six pack a night and you want to take a natural probiotic and i mainly talking about like fermented vegetables and sauerkraut kimchi things like that to reestablish these microbes all right the next point i want to bring up and this is probably the number one source of that breath that would be sugar sugar feeds unfriendly microbes it feeds yeast which is a type of candida and so that its primary fuel if you want to starve off these unfriendly microbes very simple just avoid sugar that called the ketogenic diet so again these microbes give off a smelly gas and they produce bad breath they also make acids that can put holes in your bones and i about your teeth as in cavities and the average teenager is consuming at least 18 teaspoons of sugar and that added that carbohydrates that they you can imagine how much bad bacteria that the next point i want to bring up is the fact that your mouth is part of an entire system called the digestive system so when you focus on one little part of this whole system and neglect the other parts you fix bad breath so many people have bad breath because of a lower digestive system problem either in the stomach the small intestine or the large intestine so this is why if you have weak stomach acid or you don enough acidity in your stomach you not going to get the proper digestion and that alone can create gas that can come up for your breath and that occurs from just having incomplete digestion so this is why apple cider vinegar on a regular basis this is why taking betaine hydrochloride after a meal which is a natural acidifier is really good for bad breath and also it prevents something called sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth normally the bacteria should be in the large intestine not so much in the small intestine i mean there there but there shouldn you get too much bacteria and i bacteria in the wrong place you happens is these microbes compete for your nutrients and they also create a lot of gas and they create a lot of bad breath in overgrowth of unfriendly microbes and this can definitely create not just bloating but it also can create some bad breath now the thing you need to know about this is that if you consume probiotics and fiber okay and salads and you feel worse you have a lot of distension that could mean that you have sibo in which case you should stop eating those things and go carnivore for a little while because to kill these microbes you have to not feed them anymore and you things like betaine hydrochloride and you digestive system to reset and you might want to take a natural antibiotic like oregano for example so the reason i want to bring this up is because the recommendation of taking probiotics and fiber might be conflicting if you have sibo so one of the key ways you know is with bloating and distension if you have too much fiber or probiotics but most of the population is going to benefit from probiotics and more vegetables and things like that but if you don suspect sibo but at this point probably the most important thing to study next is my video on digestion if you haven seen this i think you like it check it out you	Success
The Silent Symptoms of Dementia: Watch Out for These 6 Warning Signs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFF2GvkQfNU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we early signs of um what was that um dementia now before i begin i want to tell you a little story about what happened when i was in practice and this relates to early signs of dementia that weren you see when you maybe you didn all of the symptoms of dementia but not really have dementia and the worst thing you could do is give your spouse or partner the wrong diagnosis or even diagnose them at all that this relates to a couple that came in my office quite some years ago with early signs of dementia and as i was talking to husband i asked him when did you first notice signs of dementia he said i sure but i think it was when my wife started to diagnose me and i was like oh okay and i noticed when they were sitting there they were going back and forth and the husband was having problems remembering certain things and his wife was constantly correcting him and telling him honey you forgot again and uh you mixing up your words and etc etc and so i was brutally honest and i actually just told her that things worse every time you remind someone that you made a mistake you they over and over and over so i pulled the wife to the side and i i said i want you to do an experiment i want you to just let him make mistakes and just don correct him at all for one week and when they came back after a week it was quite amazing because he was articulate he was sharp he didn seem to have any cognitive dysfunction at all so i just want to bring that up because when i cover these six signs it doesn if you have these occasionally and if you know someone who has these symptoms just realize it could be sleep it could be their blood sugars it could be any number of things that is not real dementia all right that being said what is dimension it what parts of your brain are atrophying they specifically a structure called the hippocampus which i talk about in a little bit but here are the early signs okay you have difficulty organizing and planning things you have personality changes okay there change in personality but again that can happen in for any number of reasons number three and this is interesting constipation now realize just because you have conservation does not mean you have dementia but it is one of the early signs simply because of the connection between the gut and the brain your gut is like a second brain you have more nerve fibers in your digestive system than you do in your spinal column and a lot of cognitive problems actually can stem from your gut the microbiome in your gut all those bacteria make neurotransmitters in fact those little microbes make more serotonin than your brain makes serotonin and people that have alzheimer higher incidence of constipation than someone who doesn issues then the next symptom would be sensory dysfunction that can include issues with smell taste hearing your eyesight and it can also be your appetite all of these could be some of the early signs of a cognitive decline and as it declines more and more and more the ability to focus the ability to concentrate and your overall memory is what really shows up as being a problem all right number five language problems which i already mentioned like you find words for certain things you tend to repeat things over and over again or you might be mixing up your words this is a problem with the hippocampus and there that i video but like there example that a person is able to talk and make sentences totally fine but it incoherent what they make sense and i frustrating because the person is trying to get out this communication but it coming out very randomly and all over the place this is mainly a problem with this hippocampus and the hippocampus is just shrinking i do if you have this problem or you know someone who has this problem and the last sign of early dementia is the inability to navigate well in new places so let into a new place you you just cannot for the life of you find this location this is because in our brain we have a gps that allows us to locate where we are in space and when this area goes down you lose your gps so your internal map is dysfunctional and you just cannot find out where you are so if you have a problem with that that could be an early sign of dimension all right now i things that you need to do to correct this okay before it becomes more advanced the best time to correct this is right now in these early stages as compared to waiting before it becomes a real big problem and i think you can correct it if you get it early enough but the big problem in medicine is the lack of importance or significance that your diet makes in this area of your body they don seem to connect the dots between the great importance of what you eat and how that can affect your brain they like well this could be genetic could just be some stress things just happen and there about it your diet is key in preventing and even reversing dementia if you can get it early enough alright so the first thing to know is what would shrink your hippocampus okay a really common cause of a problem with hippocampus especially when in atrophies is a thymine deficiency that is a b1 deficiency and you can look this up it usually that can happen from alcohol but it can also happen when you consuming a lot of carbohydrates you are going to deplete vitamin b1 so the more sugar you eat the more carbohydrates you consume the more b1 your body needs the demand for thymine goes way up when you consume carbohydrates because you need vitamin b1 to metabolize carbohydrates and the more alcohol you drink the more b1 you need as well so number one start taking b1 and nutritional yeast is the best source of b1 and just make sure that you get the kind that not fortified with synthetic vitamins i recommend going on the natural side because synthetic vitamins might work initially but they long-term solution now of course you also want to do things that will prevent a b1 deficiency and that would be not drinking alcohol anymore and also giving up some of these carbs but i have some good news you can consume vegetable carbohydrates right so that exciting all right let number two and i talked a little bit about this but you want to fix the gut the microbiome there on alzheimer seems to always be a lack of diversity in the microbiome there always seems to be gut inflammation in these patients as well so one of the important things to do is to increase the diversity of the microbiome and one of the best ways to do that is to start consuming different types of vegetables not just one type of vegetable over and over and over like just salad but if you salad have a wide variety of different types of salad different types of fibers that have different phytonutrients that can then strengthen different strands so that one way another way is to do fasting fasting increases the diversity of your microbiome now you would think if you starved off the microbes they would get weaker but they get stronger and you have new strains that just kind of come out and start to thrive it mechanism that has been evolving for for eons now also realize that your gut and your brain is bidirectional okay through the vagus nerve you have information going from the gut to the brain and information going from the brain down to the gut so if you have a problem with your brain you gut if your problem with your gut you can have a problem with your brain and like i said before a good amount of the neurotransmitters are produced by your microbes a good amount of the b vitamins are made by your own microbes and there on getting people off gluten and seeing huge improvements in dementia and so gluten can actually worsen dementia and i gluten-free diet i in a low-carb no grain diet and one little point about gmo foods foods that have been exposed to glyphosate which is an herbicide which is connected to gmo foods are not good for your brain simply because glyphosate works by destroying microorganisms certain pathways in microbes like bacteria well guess what that can affect our microbes just like it affects the microbes in the soil so you do want to start consuming more organic foods non-gmo foods all right number three and this is pretty powerful i found some great research on consuming more sprouts like broccoli sprouts that have sulforaphane now unique thing about sprouts is that they come from these little seeds okay and if you were to consume the seed it would be first of all not very available to you as far as the nutrition in it and so it when it sprouts you have incredible amounts of nutrition that so if you regular basis you nutrition that a plant has but you also getting certain phytonutrients that are not just anti-cancer like i talked about in other videos they are super food for your brain so sulfurophane in broccoli sprouts is fantastic for any type of neurodegenerative disorders plus sprouts are really good for your gut and with alzheimer the incidence of leaky gut is also very very high so include sprouts in your salad on a regular basis and they cheap to to grow yourself all right number four and this is also very very important ketones ketones bypass the damage in the brain and feed the neurons directly because think about what you cells so we need to restore that we need to feed the brain cells fuel so apparently at that stage it not getting glucose fuel so if you feed it ketone fuel it can thrive and so if you have any stage of dementia at all you need to be doing regular intermittent fasting as well as periodic prolonged fasting and you going to see huge benefits and for two reasons number one is that you ketones than you would even if you want a low carb diet and you up regulate all sorts of genetic factors that support your brain now i also recommend consuming like mct oil you can also do exogenous ketones you can buy these ketones as a supplement and so you just take like one tablespoon of mct oil maybe twice a day and that will help your brain a lot all right dinkle biloba has shown some significant benefits for dementia patients specifically the extract e g b 761 so apparently that extract gives you some significant neural protection to your brain all right number six this is a good one lion are just fascinating the research done on lion as far as impacting your cognitive function i mean it huge impact on your brain so i to put that information down below and then there that i always talk about in my videos on your brain that would be the omega-3 fatty acids specifically dha found in fatty fish and fish oil and especially cod liver oil then you also have vitamin d which has a huge impact zinc very important exercise something else that oxygen to your brain and sleep if you you going to be more stressed and you going to deplete the brain of oxygen now if you haven the brain you need to check this out i put it up right here	Success

remedy is extremely effective so skin tags and warts what is the actual cause well most of the information i could find points to the hpv virus human papilloma virus this is an extremely common virus that infects 325 million women worldwide and there are over 100 different types and 14 of them have the ability to cause cancer but realize that what determines someone getting cancer or not is really the epigenetic factors those are the things that are superior to your genes like the environment what you expose yourself to your lifestyle what you eat your stress level and so you can do a lot of things to keep this virus in remission now when you get infected with a virus your immune system is going to fight that virus but these viruses are very very stealth and so they go into hiding and they don anything so there your immune system to find them and so they just wait and they wait and they wait until your immune system becomes lowered let you go through stress and then it comes out and it kicks you when you cervical cancer for women is hpv and this is the fourth most common cause of cancer in women so it deal but there are several studies i going to list down below that show that you can use a simple home remedy called iodine to help make these skin tags and wards go bye-bye so one study showed 77 percent success rate but i not satisfied with 77 we want to bring it closer up to 100 percent so this is why we garlic now garlic is not only deadly to viruses but also to cancer the phytonutrient allicin in garlic suppresses viruses from invading different areas of the body including the cervix and anal canal now there found in a patent someone was attempting to get the patent using topical iodine to help suppress the hpv virus to inactivate this virus to decrease the risk of cervical dysplasia and to prevent cancer in the uterus and the anal canal so i information below now in this natural home remedy you things you iodine which you can get pretty much anywhere in the drugstore and you going to be using some fresh garlic now there know about pobidone iodine number one it types of iodine it can actually absorb into the skin and do its magic this type of iodine is also used to treat burns and vaginal infections and apparently microbes don resistant to it like an antibiotic and other forms of treatment so iodine is really good to suppress viruses bacteria fungus mold parasites and so is garlic garlic is antimicrobial as well so the combination of both of these items is going to be very deadly to that skin tag and wort so this is how you make this concoction you take a little dish and you crush up some garlic okay crush it up to the point where there juice in the garlic now you get another dish with a couple drops of pobidine iodine and then you take a very small amount i about maybe an eighth of a teaspoon of the garlic juice and some of the material just a tiny bit and mix it with the iodine just mix it all up in a solution then you that solution and apply it topically right over the skin tag for the wart and then cover it up with a band-aid then you cover it up with a little saran wrap keep it in the refrigerator it to last one day because what you want to do is you want to do two applications per day so you can use the same garlic that you crushed in the morning and again just put a couple drops of iodine with it mix it up apply it to the same skin tag and wart and then cover it up with another band-aid so you repeating the same thing twice a day and you this skin tag or wart is completely gone now what determines the speed at which it goes away is probably related to your health you may be a diabetic or pre-diabetic or have very severe insulin resistance because diabetics or people with blood sugar problems have a higher risk of getting skin tags and warts and so there between insulin resistance and viruses so as a side note if you haven gone on the ketogenic diet and practice intermittent fasting i would highly recommend you do that because those two things are very powerful and can help you in the long run to prevent them from coming back now some people will see a complete disappearance within about seven hours but like i said before it could take some weeks even up to six weeks but you should see a gradual reduction in the size over time now the garlic that you use when you crush it should last several days however we want to make sure that the potency is at its highest level so i recommend you use a fresh clove of garlic every single day and also when you crush the garlic it takes about 10 to 15 minutes for the phytochemicals to become activated but it doesn because you material with iodine underneath the band-aid so it into the skin and do its magic now i also recommend that you eat garlic during this process and you use it in your food you can get garlic powder as a supplement and on top of that start taking zinc zinc is also very beneficial for viruses especially hpv so i would recommend taking about 50 milligrams of zinc every single day in a blend of trace minerals if you want more information on that i put a link down below but the fact that you have a skin tag and a wart could indicate that your blood sugars are too high your a1c might be a little bit higher you may have insulin resistance so this is why you should start the ketogenic diet as well as in a minute of fasting i put a real simple to understand playlist of your exact steps right here check it out	Success
Vitamin C Deficiency (Subclinical Scurvy) Â Causes, Symptoms, and Remedies Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHKuh4BedXc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys in this video we about something called subclinical scurvy now what does scurvy mean scurvy is a severe vitamin C deficiency ok subclinical is something that doesn show up on a blood test or a usual test so it might be that you slowly developing a vitamin C deficiency you just before that phase kind of like a pre-diabetes type situation in another word for that is called latent scurvy where you doesn just don it kind of slowly starts to happen and a lot of people are deficient in vitamin C in fact one out of five men are deficient in vitamin C one out of nine women are deficient in vitamin C one person might have it in there like gums is bleeding gums another person could have it in their muscles as a weak inflamed muscle where someone else could have it in the arteries of the heart okay so it could be different for different people so that it diagnosis of vitamin C deficiency and go oh you have these three things that you have it okay because it could be actually have a wide range of things so I wanted to kind of give you an overview kind of just a general idea of what could occur if you deficient in vitamin C and maybe you not a full-blown scurvy case but you have some of the symptoms okay here you feel weak irritable leg pain inflammation achy joints muscles I mean this is very very common now instead of going out there and getting very expensive tests to figure this out all you have to do is start consuming foods high in vitamin C and see if you get better see if these things clear right up and you they do that thing to do but the tissue in your body that is most susceptible to vitamin C deficiencies is your vascular system because vitamin C has the purpose of keeping the collagen in the arteries nice and strong and elastic okay when you don you get certain like little lesions or holes in the arteries so vitamin C is intimately involved in vascular integrity okay and so you have capillary damage which really happens with high levels of sugar in the blood or glucose in the blood being a pre-diabetic or a diabetic and then you end up having high insulin what happens is that high amount of sugar competes with vitamin C so you vitamin C goes down then you become susceptible to getting capillary damage and so you have little areas of bleeding in the artery in inflammation and then comes the cholesterol and the calcium as a band-aid this can also happen in your skin as rosacea it can happen on the gums as bleeding gums it can happen in your nose as a nosebleed so really you need vitamin C to protect you against high levels of sugar because this can also affect the capillaries to the nerves as well another nutrient that will protect this as b1 but vitamin C will do it too so you want to start increasing your vegetable content dark leafy greens the bell pepper is loaded with it cabbage sauerkraut fermented actually has a tremendous amount of vitamin C berries have vitamin C other vegetables now citrus also has vitamin C but when you buy bottled lemon juice or lime juice it hardly any vitamin C in there so the key with this is have actual lemons and get your juice from the lemons if you trying to get your vitamin C from it okay so I just wanted to bring this up you may have these symptoms you want to prevent this right here and the way you do it is through the foods having foods higher in vitamin C and also keeping your Sugar by doing keto and intermittent fasting hey if you haven press the button below and I will keep you in the know hey that runs	Success
How to Stop BLOATING Fast / Learn the 5 Causes - Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EKYAgSdjhA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	do you experience bloating i know i did for many many years it was very very uncomfortable it seemed like almost everything i ate i was i felt like i was pregnant and it was very difficult to sleep it was difficult to constantly suck in my stomach to try to avoid anyone knowing that i was actually bloated so this is what you need to know about bloating there are many different causes of bloating okay there one cause so i the causes but there thing you can do to identify where it take a look at when you started getting bloating okay was it yesterday was it today what time did you start getting bloating and then what did you eat right before was it the obvious junk food or processed food was it sugar alcohols let and you had some i don erythritol or mannitol whatever and then that created the bloating because that was new okay or you saw in one of my videos that i recommended consuming seven to ten cups of salad and now you was it that cruciferous vegetable that you normally don and then you start getting bloated or maybe it was dairy okay that cause of bloating or you bought a keto snack or a keto bar that had corn fiber for example which was a new ingredient that you added to your diet and now you need to do is just avoid that thing and you like in practice i had this one lady who came in and she says i i following day and guess what she was pregnant so you pregnant but very simply just find out when you introduce that was new and just avoid that thing but let you have bloating is there anything you could do to get rid of the bloating yes there is so if this is the right side of the underneath the rib cage and this is your left side right through like this you simply could massage the two key parts of your digestive system that are many times responsible for bloating one is the gallbladder on the right side or it could be the pancreas which i so what you kind of start massaging right underneath the rib cage okay and i like to just press about an inch off the midline to the right and about an inch down from your rib cage maybe two inches down and press right into that area and just kind of massage to the left and the right and just kind of hold this point for about one to two minutes just don you massage tool or the end of some dull piece of wood but don object okay and then you just kind of work on the left side and you start massaging these two areas and you going to help kind of decongest these organs and get rid of a lot of bloating and it gas through or fluid now one side note i want to mention uh one of my patients noticed that their constant bloating went away when they went down to florida and laid on the beach okay and that was because this person was going through a massive stress and every time they experience sun and the reduction of cortisol stress their stomach reduced to the point where it was flat and that is because cortisol or stress creates inflammation and swelling in the midsection okay so that that you go through a stress event and you notice your stomach is distended especially as the day goes on but let go through each organ and talk about the potential cause of your bloating let start with the stomach here if the stomach does not have enough acid or the ph of the stomach is too alkaline okay because you whatever you can experience either acid reflux okay or gerd or heartburn or indigestion indigestion is a real good clue that you don acid in your stomach or bloating okay so if you have bloating and you have indigestion or acid reflux then it from the stomach the thing about the stomach is it to help you start to digest okay and if you don people from that point on the food stuff will kind of go through this whole chain of events and if it going to be undigested here and these organs are going to have to work harder so it acid in your stomach to start the process of breaking down the protein especially with the right amount of acid okay so if you need acid what you can do is take something called betaine hydrochloride it comes in a supplement and you would take maybe five or six of these with a meal and that the stomach regain its acid the other thing you could take is apple cider vinegar either on an empty stomach or with food so you would take one or two tablespoons and some water and that will help your digestion okay so that would be the stomach the next thing i want to talk about is the gallbladder the purpose of the gallbladder is to concentrate bile which is like a detergent that helps you break down fat by a factor of 5x so it helps to concentrate the bile so when you eat it and it mixes with the pancreatic enzymes to help you break down certain things okay now if the gallbladder does not have enough bile maybe you don maybe it you belching or bloating or you nauseated and there but you can feel bloating if you don have enough bile salts okay so if you bloat and you have this belching and burping and maybe you have a a full sensation underneath the right rib cage or you have pain that into the right shoulder right through here it could be up up back through here it could be up here or in your neck then suspect gallbladder and then you need some purified bile salts or gallbladder formula to help assist this gallbladder so that would be some clues that it could be that you need help right through in here the other thing you can do and you can use this also to help figure out if it is the gallbladder is just press underneath the right rib cage you start massaging underneath the right rib cage and if your discomfort on the right side goes away or you feel less bloating chances are it could be that you just need a little help with more bile salts all right now we have the pancreas right pancreas is more on the left side but it does cross over a little bit to the center maybe to the right side but if your pancreas needs help let say you don because of various reasons maybe you diabetic or you in the past and you pancreas the pancreas just makes enzymes you could get diarrhea you can get floating stool like kind of like a greasy stool that floats that means you don break down that fat it and guess what you of bloating if this is the case okay you need more enzymes so you get some supplement that has a wide variety of enzymes you also want to make sure that you consume food with enzymes maybe some raw like salads okay to get more enzymes to help you digest as well as fermented food like sauerkraut things like that would help take the pressure off the pancreas the pancreas also improves when you cut down the high carbs okay because the more sugar you have the more insulin that has to work harder so that stomach you need more acid the gallbladder bile with the pancreas enzymes moving right along we have this thing called the small intestine which is right in the center the small intestine is where you have 90 of all the digestion okay and so the food particles that are broken down by the stomach into amino acids the gallbladder breaking down the fat the the pancreas helping breaking down food and then the small intestine which also has enzymes but it supposed to have a lot of bacteria a lot of the bacteria the good bacteria should be in this large intestine okay further down but you have this long pipe that the food should go through and the enzymes and other things should act on the food to break it down and then help it be absorbed so it can go in through the liver and other places in the body but a lot of people get bloating in the small intestine okay they actually have fermentation going on in the small intestine fermentation is the action of a microbe on a food like a carbohydrate a fiber or sugar okay now an example of this would be with my chickens okay so i have about 16 chickens and we eat their eggs and what i do is i ferment the food okay the when you ferment the food you actually soak it in water for three days and the bacteria that and which by the way the organic grains is going to act on the carbohydrate break them down and make it much easier for the chicken to digest that food plus in the fermentation process you get a lot of gases that are released like carbon dioxide as you can see in this image right here we have a lot of carbon dioxide and other gases being produced by the microorganisms it looks like it releasing gas but guess what when you have this excess fermentation going on in your small intestine that gas is going to produce a lot of distension and bloating so you could have either fluid retention okay going on the small intestine or gas because if you certain foods in the small intestine you one version of bloating but it can also be a combination of gas as well so this condition in the small intestine is called sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth okay this is a situation where you have bacteria that normally should be in the large intestine but it intestine it the food coming down is being fermented in the wrong place and you get a lot of gas and fluid retention and how do we know you have sibo well if you consume probiotics guess what you you you consume more salad or fiber it get more bloating why because you have these bacteria that are ready to ferment it and at this level and you going to feel worse if you consume that so that potentially you have sibo you can go get a test so what do you do if you have sibo well you want to avoid probiotics and you want to avoid fiber so you probably want to do carnivore for a while which means you not going to be consuming any plant fiber okay any vegetables for a while maybe one or two months to reset your system the other thing you should take is oregano and garlic to act as a natural antibiotic you can also do clove and thyme and even sage things like that and that will act as a natural antibiotic but these two work really good another really important thing to do would be fasting intermittent fasting fast as long as you can that will help to reset and clean this out okay so that all right now we also have excessive amounts of fermentation going on giving you bloating and gas if you have this situation it could be you just have an imbalance in microbes and you have the wrong amount of certain microbes versus the other in which case a wide range of vegetables might be helpful more fiber a lot of people that i know that have problems down here have like rarely have any vegetables in fact the average person consumes i think a cup and a half of vegetables every single day it not enough so the the microbes live on the fiber but if you on a regular basis they might not grow to the the amount that you want or to the diversity that you need so a probiotic and fiber would be beneficial for this situation so if you feel better when you take a probiotic or fiber or a combination like sauerkraut has good bacteria and fiber if you feel better when you take that chances are your problem is in the large intestine if you feel worse when you consume sauerkraut chances are you might have a problem in the small intestine okay so that differentiate those two but anyway i wanted to go through the whole system to help you understand the different parts of this digestive system and the potential cause of your bloating so you can fully eliminate it now the other thing i want to mention if you not doing intermittent fasting i would first go for that implement that before you even get into any of these things because you just might need to have the correct eating plan and the correct time of eating to correct the whole thing so if you want that information i put a very simple playlist you can learn this very quickly right here

Transform Your Health with Cold Showers Â Dr. Berg's Guide to Cold Showers	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IvJ15Ug6fc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	what would happen after 14 days two weeks if you took a cold shower every single day that to talk about we dive into this topic now you may have heard of this guy called iceman he wrote a book he developed the wim hof method using things like ice baths cold showers to improve your health i about some of the benefits and the research revolving around using cryotherapy or cold therapy now before you click off and say there is no way in heck i am going to ever take a cold shower just hear me out because there are some seriously positive benefits from doing this and you can do it very very gradually so it uncomfortable okay now i all right now you would think that going out in the cold when it and it that stay out of that rain it there you stay inside where it well it just so happens that when you expose your body to the cold i talking long term just a short term your immune system becomes enhanced you get more monocytes and lymphocytes these are white blood cells that fight off pathogens you have a boost of t helper cells the t helper cell is like the quarterback of the entire immune system okay you also get a spike of t suppressor cells that help to calm down an overactive immune system so they prevent too much destruction of the immune system so it where your immune system is fighting things off yet you have other factors that are making sure there much collateral damage so your immune system is enhanced when you expose it to cold which is very very counter-intuitive number two you get a spike of noradrenaline noradrenaline is similar to adrenaline and when they tested people that have anxiety attention deficit disorder depression they usually have low noradrenaline so by using this amazing method of exposing yourself to cold you can spike noradrenaline and improve your overall mood so if you can pull yourself out of that lower emotion if you have anxiety excessive worry things like that you it can elevate your emotion it can help your cognitive function your focus your memory you can become more alert so apparently our bodies have evolved over eons to adapt to things like cold hunger starvation so our bodies through this process have developed certain type of adaptive survival mechanisms to improve our health to survive better when exposed to cold and hunger and things like that it hormetic effect is when you expose someone to a stress and then the body adapts and becomes stronger like exercise would give you a hormetic effect fasting would give you a hormonal effect taking a cold shower would definitely do it all right the next thing is that taking a cold shower is going to help you lose weight how well when you take a cold shower you brown fat another term for brown fat is brown adipose tissue so the sensation of cold is the main stimulus to stimulating brown fat so the more cold the more brown fat that you have now what this brown fat versus the white fat or white adipose tissue well brown fat increases heat energy and metabolism your metabolism is going to be raised when you have more brown fat you weight and brown fat will also trigger more loss of white fat which is the storage fat that you have in your body okay so that 100 grams of brown fat can burn 3 400 calories per day that calories than you potentially could eat in a given day so we want more brown fat on our body another reason why it can help you lose weight it can create an increase in insulin sensitivity okay if you more you improve insulin sensitivity the less insulin that because it there insulin and the more weight loss you going to have the better the blood sugars you so if you have diabetes your pre-diabetes and you take a cold shower you sugars actually come into check much better and when that happens you going to lose weight number five cold showers help with inflammation they are anti-inflammatory so if you have inflammation in your body if you have some type of autoimmune disease if you have arthritis bursitis tendinitis taking a cold shower would be a very therapeutic thing number six cold showers can increase your overall antioxidant networks okay more antioxidants the less dna damage the less risk of getting cancer and other diseases number seven neural protection okay cold showers help your brain and so apparently cold activates the regrowing of neurons okay so that and also as a side note when you you have a much better sleep now this is within reason okay i freezing i the temperature a little bit cooler you will sleep a little bit better so another benefit i forgot to add on to this is sleep all right number eight longevity why because cold showers stimulate autophagy just like fasting stimulates autophagy autophagy is a condition that your body gets into where it damaged proteins okay so if there working in the body like their proteins or enzymes or their mitochondria or they in amyloid plaquing or whatever your body turn that into brand new proteins the other cool thing about taking a cold shower is that it will help lower cortisol that means it your stress okay also it recovery so if you and you recovery coal therapy is the way to go i remember long ago when my wife and i went to the dominican republic and uh i remember we walked off the beaten path and found this little oasis this little um like building and they had all these different uh little baths and they were like they looked like little jacuzzis but some were really really cold and some were really really hot they had like freezing lukewarm hot really hot and so on and that was a really interesting introduction to cold therapy because at first it didn me why would anyone want to jump into some cold bath right but we both tried it out and it was freezing but then of course we went into the warmer bath and the hot jacuzzi and i remember feeling really incredible after doing that my body was just like feeling amazing and i slept great and then i kind of forgot about it for some years now coming full circle here i am talking about exposing yourself to cold so anyway here showers and think about it if you can experience these benefits from just a cold shower i mean you probably taking a shower every day all you have to do is turn it to the cold for a little bit and then turn it back to the hot and i what i would recommend i would do this when you start with the hot shower okay get comfortable get really hot take the hot shower feel comfortable and then turn it to the cold okay i mean a nice cold shower not lukewarm but really cold for about 30 seconds now anyone can handle 30 seconds right and then turn it back to hot and then just have that as your introduction to the cold the next day you go in there start to increase the 30 seconds to maybe 40 seconds okay and then the next shower turn up to 50 seconds and gradually increase this to the point where you for 5 to 10 minutes but if you do it gradually it won benefits that you going to be mind-blowing and you going to finally realize you should have did this a long time ago what interesting you have all these feedback systems in in the body that when you expose your body to a very cold sensation it actually warms up the internal core of your body you actually get more circulation internally the flip side of that when you take a hot shower it actually cools down the inside of your core this is why taking a hot shower before bed might be a good thing because it body and you the body sleeps better when it slightly colder but anyway this might be an easy way to approach this cold shower unless you want to just do a cold turkey and just jump right in now the other thing that i want to mention is infrared saunas okay use a lower temperature than a traditional sauna so they use like 120 to 140 degrees fahrenheit versus traditional saunas which are 150 to 180 degrees fahrenheit now this has nothing to do with a cold therapy but the only point of bringing it up is that it as hot as a traditional therapy and there effects to infrared which i will share in another video real soon but anyway as you can see if you did cold therapy for 14 days you would see remarkable health benefits now if you haven on the benefits of fasting you have to see that check it out right here you	Success
8 Dangerous Signs that Should NEVER Be Ignored	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LM559JDVQok	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let signs that you should never ignore now before i begin let me just give you a disclaimer now make sure you check with your doctor before implementing the suggestion of checking with your doctor well maybe i don disclaimer in this video but anyway if you videos uh sometimes you might have got the impression that i medicine or medical doctors that is absolutely not true i respect medical doctors i respect competent medical doctors when i busted my elbow in an accident they took me from a very serious situation where i had 30 little pieces of bone fragments and put me back together again so i to use my elbow so i highly respect competent medical professionals the challenge i have is with the system in general and just the lack of emphasis on your foods and nutrition it medical school and unfortunately big pharma has too much control over the medical profession in which these drugs can be set up to last only 24 hours and then you got to take another drug and unfortunately it where the patient is becoming an atm for big pharma but let me just get into the eight dangerous signs that you should never ignore and you should go see your doctor to get more information number one excuse me um a cough now there is acute coughs which only lasts like three weeks and they usually go away by themselves you have sub-acute coughs that could last three to eight weeks okay then you have this chronic cough and the person clearing their throat and they coughing for a long period of time usually after eight weeks now if you tried everything you tried vitamin d you even tried calcium calcium lactate which is a non-dairy type of calcium which works really good for these chronic coughs and if that still has not resolved the cough then you need to go get it checked out and get more information especially if there difficulty swallowing if you have a fever if you check and your lymph nodes are still enlarged there going on and especially if the cough is getting worse all right number two uh hold on a second let me just make sure you see this oh yeah loss of vision that was my dry sense of humor in one or both eyes that could potentially be a blood clot in the retinal artery okay which could mean various things it could mean that you had a tia which means you could have had a mini stroke or a transient ischemic attack now the problem with a mini stroke is that you may be at risk of getting a second stroke in fact if you had a mini stroke there chance that you may have another stroke within 90 days so you want to get it checked out anytime you have a stroke you want to get to the emergency room as fast as possible so then they can give you a certain medication to thin the blood and prevent any further damage now it could be a brain tumor it could be glaucoma it could be any number of things i remember i had a patient whose husband was coming in with her and he just had the worst diet in the world in fact one day he let me check him out and i had him lay on the table and i was chucking him out and his extremities his arms and his legs completely went dead his extremities just lost feeling and function okay that circulation problem you would think he would do something about it now he was an expert at ignoring these symptoms okay until eventually he came in uh blind well guess what he had diabetes and he didn didn anything so now he so a loss of vision could mean something related to diabetes as well all right next one drooping or weakness on one side of your body all right now that could either be that you had a stroke or it sign that a stroke is on its way and over seven million people a year die of strokes now there fast we have f which is face droop okay a arm week s speech difficulty means t time to call an easy way to remember it all right number four let okay this mole in your body that is starting to grow okay that means you need to get it checked out because you want to rule out something called a melanoma which is skin cancer now there i okay let is it asymmetrical so usually with a mole you have a very symmetrical uh shape all right but with melanoma it asymmetrical all right the border around a mole is very smooth and even but the border around a melanoma is very rough it non-smooth border all right c a melanoma will have different colors okay a mole pretty much stays consistently the same color kind of a brown or darker brown but a melanoma could turn like yellow blue green red so if you see your mole changing then get it checked out okay next one is diameter when you have a melanoma the size of it is usually greater than six millimeters okay that would be the about a fourth of an inch or the size of a pencil eraser but if you have a penny it penny is about i think it millimeters so it would be one-fourth of a penny so moles are smaller melanomas are larger all right e evolution is it changing is it evolving is it a growing suspect melanoma get it checked now just so you know i did a video on melanomas and i talked about sun you can watch that video i know there but sun has a lot of great therapeutic benefits but when you and you get burnt that start increasing your risk for certain types of problems with the skin but if you it can be very therapeutic in different ways because sometimes the people are so freaked out they stay in the house all the time to never go out in the sun and they don benefit of just being outside all right number five let a frequent and excessive thirst okay you just out of the blue your mouth is dry you didn you an electrolyte and also you but you have to pee a lot well that could mean that you have diabetes because what going to dump this excess sugar and wherever the sugar goes the water goes so get it checked check your blood sugars of course if you channel you probably are not going to have this because you implementing all these wonderful ideas about going on a ketogenic diet and doing intermittent fasting so this is really about you know your friends and family that might have this symptom just because i having super high levels of blood sugars but not knowing it and then having all these symptoms i mean you can literally go into a coma if your blood sugars are too high so you won you keep your carbs on the low side okay number six resting tremors okay now that can happen because you because you haven can happen right after exercise but it could also potentially be the early signs of parkinson you start noticing a resting tremor and your gait is slowed down and you become very very stiff and rigid and you have a masked face where your face it looks very very serious or very depressed yet you that could be early signs of parkinson but also it could be that you have what your ph your blood ph is on the alkaline side okay tremors is one of the symptoms and so if you also have like tetany like twitching or muscle cramps it just could be a ph problem so it good to get checked out all right number seven some changes in the breast tissue so let lump in the breast or in your armpit you might want to get that checked out because that could be the early signs of a tumor but here there breast okay where there cyst developing in the breast tissue and it but it is a cyst which is different so i just want to mention this because the most powerful remedy for that it seems to work like nearly 100 of the time is seek help okay because the iodine in seek help helps to modulate or control estrogen dominance in the body and so it really dramatically will get rid of ovarian cysts and cysts in the breast tissue so if you do have some lump and you take sea kelp and it doesn checked out last one let okay you don realize it could be a hemorrhoid it could be some ulcer in your large intestine let see you have some type of inflammation and in your large intestine or even your small intestine that can create blood in the stool or let just had some beets that can make your stool red or it could be colorectal cancer and so it early as possible so you can do something about it so the point of this video is not to ignore your body communication to you but to get more data in your evaluation so you can have knowledge and do something about it now if you haven on how to get so healthy that you can prevent and avoid all these things right here i put it right here check it out you	Success

alkalosis this is a situation where the ph of your lungs is too alkaline hyperventilation sweating dizziness palpitations lump in the throat high pulse rate heart pounding and chest pain they exact same symptoms so that why do you have these symptoms over here panic attack are identical to this other condition right here to understand what the scenes there teach you there is an effect called the bohr effect b-o-h-r bor comes from someone bohr he was a danish physiologist and i think it was 1904 he made an observation which still stands right now in order for oxygen to bind and be released in the blood okay the hemoglobin you need co2 okay if there enough co2 the oxygen will not be released from the blood in fact check this out 80 of oxygen is returned to the lungs undelivered but here you are trying to breathe oxygen right because you panic mode all this oxygen is going through the lungs it body and it and you oxygen eighty percent of the oxygen because the oxygen for some reason cannot be released and in normal lungs when you have normal oxygen and sufficient co2 we get this release of oxygen from the hemoglobin hemoglobin is just the part of the blood that protein that helps you carry and deliver oxygen it oxygen and so when you don you get air hunger you more oxygen right that hyperventilation and then what are you going to do you right you more and guess what you worse you suffocating i mean just think about when a person hyperventilates they actually end up passing out or better yet let say you have a party and you person that has to blow up all the balloons right what happens when you start blowing up all these balloons you feel very very dizzy you feel like you and that too much air so oxygen is unavailable unless there enough co2 we think of co2 being a waste product but it also has a very important function to help you release oxygen from your blood so you can breathe so what causes respiratory alkalosis too much oxygen but it right you it oxygen toxicity oxygen can become toxic if you get too much in the presence of carbon dioxide deficiency so how can we use this information to pull ourselves out of a panic attack well which one of these conditions can we control can we control sweating no not really how about dizziness palpitations lump in your throat high pulse rate no you can of these except your breathing okay so by controlling your breathing which i you can get rid of all of these symptoms let me explain so by controlling your breathing in a certain way you can resolve this whole thing and very rapidly pull yourself out of this stress or flight or fight mode okay so this is what you number one you right no longer breathe through your mouth start breathing through your nose what is this going to do it start to increase co2 co2 is a bronchial relaxer it relaxes the lungs it allows for the oxygen to finally go back into your lungs also when you breathe through your nose you increase it gives you a smooth muscle relaxation effect okay so it starts to relax the respiratory centers all right next thing is to slow down your breathing okay so we can get some more co2 so we can switch from here to here it going to start to allow you to breathe much better all right number three start breathing from your diaphragm so if you put your hand on your chest okay and your stomach we want to avoid breathing from your chest so when you breathe from your stomach not your chest you the diaphragm and the diaphragm is connected to a part of the it system that is rest and digest it relax you all right so breathe through your nose start slowing down the breathing and start breathing through your stomach or the diaphragm number four make sure your breath is soft and gentle we trying to relax the body we perfect balance of oxygen to co2 so you can get maximum oxygen so you don too much or you have don little this is why in a panic attack the timing is also important too because a lot of times the exhalation breathing out is not the same as the inhalation so you might find that your your exhalation is too quick so if you start to balance out the inhalation with the exhalation you better and you can even just count breathe in one two three through the nose breathe out one two three maybe four so it between three to four seconds in and then three to four seconds out but we breathing all this is going to pull you out of this panic attack very very fast and if you can do this outside where there get yourself into very small spaces because there and when you everything is kind of collapsing in on you you feel like controlling your body is just suffocating so with this technique we oxygen with the co2 and when you do this guess what you can pull yourself out of this condition too the ph of your lungs start going into balance and become less alkaline and exactly where they need to be all right so the next time you have a panic attack try this and then comment down below how it worked for you now if you haven technique for stress i put it right here check it out	Success
STOP Asthma Symptoms Once and For All	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYj2E3yO3gY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we get rid of asthma symptoms okay it very very powerful and uh exciting technique that you you have asthma but it can also be good for people that are in stress people that have hay fever people who snore people who have sleep apnea and even people that cannot sleep now this is based on this book right here called close your mouth developed by professor bouto and it bco breathing method extremely powerful if you have asthma now before I get into it I need to give you a little background on how this works simply because it you have to kind of understand some Basics so if we take a healthy normal person versus an asthmatic person the average breaths per minute in a normal person is between like 10 and 12 breaths per minute but an asthmatic is 15 to 20 breaths per minute okay so they breathing more frequently each breath of a normal person as far as quantity of air is about 500 milliliters okay compare that to an asmatic it milliliters to one liter of air and in a normal healthy person the volume of air per minute is about 5 to six liters compared to an asthmatic it 10 to 15 L of air and that of air per per minute so you can see an asthmatic is consuming a lot more air than a normal healthy person now here the counterintuitive part CO2 okay is normally considered a waste gas right we breathe it out we try to get rid of it but CO2 is actually more important than oxygen okay or shall I say it have asthma it now to understand why you have to understand this it effect the bore effect is an observation by I think it was a Dr bore that The Binding of oxygen in your blood okay in the hemoglobin is dependent on co2 carbon dioxide okay in other words CO2 cannot stick to hemoglobin in your blood it can into the blood unless you have enough CO2 now that piece of data that I didn recently all right so here piece of the puzzle breathing a volume of air greater than normal does not increase the amount of oxygen in your blood now that counterintuitive piece of data so when you normal you air into the blood and the blood is already saturated at a saturation rate of between 90 and 98% so when you more air than normal you are actually lowering the CO2 and remember we talked about this you lower CO2 and then the oxygen cannot bind in the blood and this is why when people hyperventilate okay they actually pass out because they getting less oxygen why because they getting less CO2 to be able to bind the oxygen to the hemoglobin so the more air the less oxygen is delivered all right so you got that concept let it sink in if it sinking in watch this part again because it part and one little side note uh when you breathe roughly about 75% of the oxygen that breathe is exhaled when you let the less CO2 you have the more the Airways are constricted so if you asmatic and you just can air realize you don CO2 the so-called waste gas actually relaxes your smooth muscle okay in your lungs it relaxes your lungs it actually helps you breathe so what is the real problem with asthma over breathing okay what do you normally see in an asthmatic they to get more air right they suffocating they get more air and when they over breathe they lock up the oxygen ability to bind in the hemoglobin so it makes it worse okay and this also would make sense too if you look at it from the Viewpoint of stress when you trying to breathe more you get more air right and where are you breathing from your lungs your chest you that extra breathing is locking up and shutting down your oxygen and you using more of your sympathetic nervous system it you relates to a quick story um a while ago I went to lunch with a patient I had a long time ago and uh we were at lunch we were talking and all of a sudden she was like I can some food got stuck in her throat and I maneuver so I had her get up and I started to do it and it didn everyone was sitting around they weren really helping and they were just kind of just they were kind of like I was surprised that someone didn but I started getting nervous because it wasn red and she and luckily I came up with this idea I said okay calm down just relax I had her sit in a chair I started to kind of massage her neck and just don fight it just relax and then bam she started to breathe again okay why because when you mode when you everything gets constricted okay including your lungs including your throat so if you definitely want to relax but the more over breathing you do the less you going to get oxygen into the blood the more you sleep apnea asthma hay fever and even nasal congestion so this is the technique okay and it simple instead of breathing fast you want to start slowing down your breath okay instead of you know trying to sigh and get more oxygen okay or gasp for air you want to just start breathing in a very regular way and a very gentle way through your nose not your mouth okay and some people find it very helpful to just put some tape on their mouth when they go to sleep at night so they can start practicing breathing through their nose so you really want to get to a state where your breathing is very silent it noticeable so even if you trying to rest and you can hear yourself breathing you don to breathe so it very very soft very gentle so the air that very light and it the nose very very light you don want to breathe with your upper chest you want to focus on breathing through the stomach okay so you can pull your diaphragm down the diaphragm is inovated by the vagus nerve which is all parasympathetic nerve control so the autonomic nervous system is both voluntary and involuntary in other words you can control your autonomic nervous system through this type of breathing you can take yourself out of this sympathetic overdrive or flight or fight mode just by calming down your breath focusing on the breath coming through your sinuses very slowly and gently and coming back into your sinesis and no longer breathing through your chest breathing through your stomach now the first thing you want to do before you do anything is you want to measure how long you can hold your breath okay comfortably so this is called the comfortable breath hold time or CP all right now if you can only hold your breath 10 seconds or less then you have a severe situation okay you have severe asthma but if you can hold your breath between 11 and 20 seconds uh it severe but you many symptoms related to asthma if you can hold your breath between 21 and 40 seconds you symptoms and if you can hold your breath over 40 seconds without that strong urge you symptoms related to asthma so the symptoms of asthma are directly related to your ability to hold your breath comfortably so guess what the goal is to get at this level right here and to be able to maintain that for at least six months to really make sure that your condition is in remission of course we can never say cure but we can say it in remission so the question is is holding your breath the actual Technique No it you can use to figure out if you progressing okay or not right this is the exercise right here you actively slowing your breath down you breathing through your nose you breathing through your diaphragm and you are when you resting at night you go in very slowly through the sinuses and out through the nose so as you monitor this CP or comfortable breath hold time you you breath longer and longer and for every increase of 5 Seconds you to feel better and better and better so what is this technique doing it increasing the concentration of CO2 and something else when you breathe very very gently through your sones you therapeutic gas called nitric oxide which relaxes the sinuses okay and you that your sinuses are going to start to open up they going to breathe better through your sinuses and when you check this breathing whole time where you holding your breath um I recommend that you just plug your nose so that way it easier to hold your breath so very simply start breathing through your nose make sure your breathing is very gentle and very calm home never hear your breath when you very silent slow your breath down as much as possible because you allow the CO2 to help the oxygen bind with your hemoglobin and use the diaphragm to help you breathe not your chest you can even put your hand on your chest and your stomach to practice that as well now the other really cool thing about this is that you your stress level is going to dramatically DEC increase your ability to sleep is going to greatly improve and everything connected with that going to improve as well so I information about videos you can watch to get more data on this as well as a link to the book but if you haven my acupressure technique on how to extract stress from your body that would be the next step check it out right here	Success

Get Energized: The REAL Reasons Why You're Always Tired - Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt6cQ2AslVM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	i would say out of all the things that i thing is in fatigue that you can have to get it from the school of hard knocks but i personally have been so tired for so many years and then overcame that fatigue and then helped tens of thousands of people so i going to show you how to get your energy back i was doing all the wrong things i was trying to take all these pills and vitamins but there was something else underneath my fatigue that i was missing and until years later when i finally figured it out it was like i took a helmet off my head and i finally woke up so let why you fatigue you have too much cortisol what it body to stress and under stress your body switches to running on glucose despite what your diet is if you have too much stress your body is going to basically run on glucose this is why there for cortisol glucocorticoid okay it glucocorticoid it hormone meant for short-term energy it supposed to give you energy but it ends up making you tired because it that also going to make glucose out of protein and fat that gluconeogenesis so here you are having all this glucose flowing through your bloodstream and then your blood sugar is going to increase and then insulin is going to come in there and push it down so when you go through chronic stress that when things start to go downhill and all that glucose will just make you thoroughly exhausted all right so the more stress you have the more your body runs on sugar now there called amygdala and it adrenal glands on top of the kidney but it works on your brain in other words it addresses a certain type of stress in your brain and that specific stress is a fear type stress it so amygdala has everything to do with different shades of fear whether it you to a major panic attack or you or right in the middle you have anxiety or you have worry all those are fear states and so anytime you have a fear state the amygdala is involved and it affect a lot of different biological processes like your ability to sleep like your ability to get into a calm state and anything that fear is going to get you to avoid that fear you probably heard of the saying um you must face your fears right well when you face your fears they no longer are fierce because fear is about avoiding something and as soon as you don it and you face it you don remedies for an adrenal stress situation or an overactive amygdala would be to take vitamin b1 okay good amounts of b1 in the form of nutritional yeast that is going to make you feel very calm now some other things you can do is take ashwagandha i have some more information on that in a link down below but ashwagandha is an adapted gym it increases your tolerance to stress there adaptogens but ashwagandha is one of the top herbs and then we have sleep more sleep better control over your stress better adrenal function and i will get to sleep in a second but the last thing i want to mention is physical work that like any physical work that you can start doing it will really help you release that stress now exercise is okay but physical work is a lot better because physical work and also exercise helps to deplete that stress energy that tends to build up that prevents you from sleeping all right number two sleep okay poor sleep will make you tired and many times you can because you have high cortisol because you between 12 midnight and 2 o middle of the night that is when you supposed to have the lowest amount of cortisol but if your adrenals are overactive that the time that you had a problem with that for years until i figure things out now one thing about sleep there hormone called melatonin i recently did a very interesting video on melatonin because there there is one type that bloodstream and in the pineal gland but there is in all of the your cells it the cells it melatonin and the way that you increase that melatonin is through infrared did you realize that over 50 of the sun rays are infrared so that infrared is actually increasing melatonin in all of your body which will greatly help your sleep but another purpose of melatonin is to act as a powerful antioxidant even more powerful than glutathione in your liver and so melatonin is really important in countering all the stress that we experience and preventing a lot of oxidative damage and free radical damage and so if you can get out in the sun definitely do that for a good period of time but if it you can also get infrared from a fireplace or a campfire or some candles or red light therapy but the sensation of infrared is like the heat that you feel from the sun or from a fire or from a light like incandescent light i about the artificial lights that they have now like from your computer and your cell phone which will all counter the infrared uh wavelength and deplete your melatonin so that reasons why people have a hard time sleeping is they the computer all day long and they can seem to recharge the melatonin now the other thing i sleep which is a really great protocol which i use on my body is i take four of my sleep aid okay right before bed about 20 minutes and three of my d3 and k2 that seems to work very effectively to get into a really nice deep delta wave sleep and it even up to nine hours of sleep so i will use that when i need to sleep a little bit longer but presently my sleep cycles are in pretty good shape vitamin d3 helps to reset the sleep centers it jet lag and it sleep cycles and so taking vitamin d right before you go to bed is actually going to help you sleep it to wake you up all right number three post viral syndrome okay so let some type of viral flu and now you have this residual fatigue you have chronic fatigue syndrome now the medical term for this it cephalomyelitis now what does that mean that a combination of muscle pain and inflammation and soreness with inflammation of your brain causing cognitive deficits as well as fatigue now that medical condition mimics the symptoms of a b1 deficiency as well as a b3 deficiency so really what i think is going on is you have this inflammatory immune response and it massive free radical damage and you with an already empty bucket of b vitamins and the residual fatigue that you have from this infection is really a vitamin deficiency that primarily vitamin b1 but also the other b vitamins as well as other nutrients as well and so if you just had an infection and you start taking nutritional yeast and or b1 try to find a natural source and you also took vitamin d3 with zinc okay you energy there you can take too as powerful antioxidants like nac and not taking a melatonin but being exposed to the infrared which naturally increases melatonin which i already mentioned is a very powerful antioxidant probably even more powerful than glutathione now the other point i want to bring up about viruses is that when you have existing viruses that are dormant in your body they okay so you had an infection let in high school like epstein-barr virus and then 20 years later it comes out of remission it usually comes out of remission when you experience stress because cortisol is an immune suppressive hormone so it actually lowers your immune system this is why a lot of people are on prednisone for all sorts of infections because it gets because it gets rid of the symptoms but what it it it response so when you have high levels of cortisol your immune system temporarily goes to sleep and the door opens up for these viruses to come out and kick you when you down so if you have any type of post-viral symptoms whether it whatever do whatever you can to find the cause of your stress and try to get rid of it because it of that fatigue if you still have the stress situation that unfortunately losses can be a part of that as well it through losses the cortisol increases the stress increases and the viruses can come out and create all sorts of problems as well so in that case if you have that situation definitely follow the things that i getting more sleep getting more nutrition getting ir taking certain nutrients et cetera all right another uh cause of fatigue is having lyme lyme disease and that comes from a spirochite which is a type of bacteria that can go in your body and create an immune reaction all the symptoms from lyme are actually coming from your own immune system trying to kill off this microbe but it can i recommend doing a natural type antibiotic and that would be something like oregano garlic thyme sage things that are natural that can help boost your immune system but without the side effects number five insulin resistance okay if you high carb diet realize that your brain is going to be slightly more unconscious because that your brain go to sleep so you to definitely need a nap after you eat when you go on a low carb diet it actually wakes up your brain you actually become more conscious you are running your brain on ketones which is a preferred fuel and so if you haven already gone on a ketogenic diet within a minute of fasting that could create the biggest effect on your energy more than anything and i did put a link down below for those of you that are new to that topic all right number six low stomach acids if you don stomach acid um especially if you as you get older and you lose the acidity in your stomach you to absorb b12 you able to absorb iron too well both of those conditions can cause anemia you not going to be able to break down protein too well that can cause fatigue you getting sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth that can make you tired not to mention all the digestive problems that you those can make you tired as well and the simple remedy is a combination of apple cider vinegar and betaine hydrochloride but just realize that you need to take a lot of it in the beginning you may need to take five to six to seven tablets right before you eat for some weeks before you really start to turn things around because betaine hydrochloride is not a very concentrated amount of hydrochloric acid it type of acid that takes wild to build up all right and the last point i to bring up is vitamin deficiencies that can create fatigue it but it can create fatigue and i just mentioned the b12 i just mentioned the iron but i didn in all of your cells you have a sodium potassium pump that generates electrical energy for your cells so you need a lot of potassium to generate that energy it but it and the way you get that is through large amounts of salads that lot of energy so that haven start increasing more salad to increase more potassium as well as the next mineral which is also involved in energy and atp which is magnesium so you can get a lot of magnesium and potassium from having large salads i notice on the days that i don tired now out of all the things you can do the most important thing is to get your diet straightened down i didn that in the past and so i was trying to take all these vitamins and do all these different things on top of eating too many carbs it never worked so you need to get on keto and do intermittent fasting as a priority number two you want to work on your stress so you can then sleep that they are connected and then number three many times there could be some underlying residue from some post infection or you have this latent virus that is coming out of remission in which case you need to take more b1 d3 zinc and some of the other things that i recommend all right if you have not seen my video on melatonin very important video check it out right here	Success
Look Younger With These 6 Simple Tips	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds00uZKiTHo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we look younger now if you tell people what to do without the why to do it a lot of times they won going to go into the why as well as what to do this information is good for new people as well as those people who have been watching my channel for quite some time so to look younger on the outside you really have to be younger on the inside now and when we youthful look we accumulation of damaged proteins okay so the more damaged proteins you have internally and externally the older you talk about a lot of different parts of this puzzle but let this term ages what is ages stands for advanced glycation and products now what the heck is that that is a combination of a sugar molecule with a protein molecule when you take sugar and protein and you heat them up you end up with these ages okay so basically proteins that are now damaged and unavailable and they can create a lot of problems throughout the body but they can also make you look really old now ages could also be a combination of glucose and fat heated as well so let me just kind of make this really simple if you were to consume this thing called ice cream for example you heating glucose lactose sugar with milk proteins very high heats boy you consuming a product that is just loaded with these ages so ice cream would be a perfect combination of fat and sugar heated another one would be barbecued ribs right you take these ribs protein and you put all the sugar sauce on it and you heat it and this is the product when someone consumes a barbecued ribs they might notice about an hour later that their their body is sluggish they have a lot of sinus issues and so this is why it making barbecued ribs use a sauce that doesn spices like a dry rub that has no sugar just spices and sea salt now what about a soda yeah when you have all this sugar and you have caramel coloring and you heat this soda boy you to get the consumption of these ages but all the sugar in your body with the temperature of 98.6 is going to combine with your own blood proteins for example and other proteins and create all this damage protein binding combinations in fact when you get your a1c tested you measuring the accumulation of excess glucose in your bloodstream over a period of three months so when you get your a1c and it it just tells us how much glycation is going on in your red blood cells you need to be in the lower fives not six seven eight i means is they a lot of sugar creating glycation and that protein and now is damaged and it things up all right now let french fry which is a starch which is basically kind of all these glucose molecules stuck together and then it also is deep fried in fat okay so we have fat plus the starch deep fried equals a tremendous amount of age so if you want to look really old real fast keep consuming fries then you have potato chips right same deal starch with some oil deep fried not good how about a donut right you have this deep fried donut boy you have refined carbohydrate with probably like corn oil or soy oil or whatever type of oil they use oh my gosh deadly i remember going to the kutztown fair in pennsylvania where they had deep fried ice cream deep fried potatoes and deep fried oreos deep fried everything in fact you don of young people walking around on that fair now what about a burger right a hamburger well we have this meat with ketchup and then we have a bun of course you want to add fries to that and a coke wow you talk about ages on steroids a perfect deadly combination to look older really quick and then you have pretty much every combination of fast food that you would find in a fast food restaurant you have chinese food you have mexican food these are all examples of ages and these are things that make you older and these are the things that you need to avoid okay let how to get rid of ages from your body okay well the gesso happens to be a condition called autophagy which is like a an oven that can cook and break down ages damage proteins and old proteins as in old skin cells and it repurposes these proteins so autophagy stands for auto meaning self feige means eating so your body is eating its own proteins in a way it old damaged proteins and making new ones so autophagy is really good for ages it old wrinkled skin and it you younger and the biggest way to get into autophagy is through fasting okay now for those of you that are new to my channel i would highly recommend starting with intermittent fasting i put some links down below but for those of you that have been watching my channel that are doing fasting already let doing two meals a day i would recommend going to one meal a day that omad now for those of you that are doing omad i would recommend to do what dry omad now what doing some videos on this topic but dry fasting which is basically not consuming any water as well as no food creates a compounding effect it so if you would drink no water all day except at night when you have that one meal but a lot of people are doing dry fasting for more than just one day they it for two days three days four days up to seven days or a longer because you can generate water from your fat cells now i that in this video but it very very powerful but it advanced and so i don unless you for a period of time but if you want to take the next level you want to start doing dry fasting with omega so i highly recommend if you want youthful skin to get a certain amount of sun okay but just make sure you don there frequencies or wavelengths like infrared that tend to buffer the damaging effect of uv light and so the benefit of infrared wavelengths can be extremely beneficial to looking youthful because it a lot of melatonin and if you haven on that topic i put it down below but melatonin is not all about sleep it getting rid of free radical damage all of your cells can make melatonin and so there for sleep one for antioxidants and one way to generate that is through sunlight you just want to make sure you don overdo it but regular exposure to sun is extremely beneficial to looking younger and that problems in the winter when you can get sun you tend to look a bit older and pasty and you don let environment is just filled with chemicals poisons drugs i mean it really hard to avoid that thank goodness we have our liver that can dismantle these poisons okay it can dismantle heavy metals it can dismantle pesticides and insecticides pollution chemicals in your in the water chemicals in the food and that phase two detoxification okay and so your liver has certain enzymes that can be boosted with certain foods to help get rid of poisons so a really important part of looking youthful is having a healthy liver if your liver is serotic or filled with cirrhosis scar tissue or it with fat or it you anything you can do to strengthen the liver is going to make you look younger and there things i now cruciferous vegetables okay they have certain phytonutrients that can boost your natural enzymes to help phase one phase two detoxification okay so that number one not to mention vegetables giving you antioxidants directly to help act as a scavenger or like a sponge to clean up all this free radical damage that chemicals or heavy metals etc so as you add more cruciferous vegetables like kale broccoli brussels sprouts arugula i like arugula in my salads you are going to create a healthy liver and the thing about the youthful look it has to be created continually okay a lot of times people just neglect this creation of health and then they wonder someday where they what happened to my body but it has to be continually created every single day now a lot of these poisons and chemicals and toxins that come through the liver you need bile to help eliminate these toxins so bile is very very important in that youthful look not just in the elimination of toxic waste but also in the extraction of fat soluble vitamins which you need desperately to look youthful like vitamin a e d and omega-3 fatty acids which is not a vitamin but it essential nutrient which all these fat soluble compounds that you need to make the skin look youthful is dependent on this bile so if you don various reasons let fatty liver let because fat stimulates bile or you have some type of you know let say you had gallstones and you removed your gallbladder so a bile deficiency will cause you to end up with a deficiency of the fat cycle vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids all the things that you really need to look youthful so this is why a combination of enough bile and consuming enough fat to get these fat cyber vitamins are really necessary to have that youthful look this is why people going on a low fat diet end up looking older because they don vitamin a d e and omega-3 fatty acids so let touch on the type of fat that i talking about i fatty fish like salmon amazing for omega-3 fatty acids which is essential for the anti-inflammatories and to counter all the omega-6 fatty acids that are also in our diet like the corn oil canola soy oil the cottonseed oil it in just so many foods it you eat and all that creates a lot of inflammation and it just makes you look older in fact it affects the eyes as in age-related macular degeneration which is very very very common and just having older looking skin but fatty fish is very very important okay the second thing is egg yolks you going to get a lot of good vitamin a from egg yolks and you get choline in egg yolks that liver and to help you regulate cholesterol there yolks too which help regulate cholesterol because people are as concerned about the cholesterol and egg yolks but it has the antidote to that cholesterol as well and also by the way you need foods high in cholesterol to build healthy membranes in your cell to build healthy sex hormones that make your skin look youthful like testosterone and estrogen you need all that good cholesterol to make healthy looking skin this is why people that are on cholesterol medication like statins end up looking really old and they end up having a lot of side effects with the muscles and inflammation and they can you need cholesterol to make bile bile is just so important and one thing you start doing too is start taking purify bile salts to help extract some of these fat soluble nutrients from the cells if you important butter butter can give you a lot of vitamin a don make sure it to vitamin e now the best source of vitamin e is sunflower seeds but it in nuts it vitamin e is very very important in skin as well as internally now another good oil would be cod liver well cod liver oil has vitamin d as well as vitamin a as well as omega-3 fatty acids okay so cod liver and cod liver oil very very important as well as beef liver too i personally can because i don you like liver liver and onions go for it organ meats are loaded with these fat soluble vitamins extra virgin olive oil very very important avocados avocado oil awesome for your skin so in other words you don there by the way it now it but it so it from my definition a healthy version of the ketogenic diet and if you ever look at someone who diet boy do they look old there their skin it looks all dried out it doesn lose weight but you don little interesting thing i want to tell you about vegetables okay you might not think that there but a lot of the phytonutrients like chlorophyll like carotenoids and the list goes on and on and on are all fat soluble so to extract these wonderful antioxidants as well as amazing phytonutrients you need bile and you also need to eat them with fat so when you have a salad put the extra virgin olive oil on it when you consuming a cruciferous vegetable put some olive oil on it consuming the greens with an oil will help you extract these wonderful phytonutrients which not only are loaded with the antioxidants but they also help that phase one phase two detoxification we the way phytonutrients also help stimulate autophagy okay on the topic of free radical damage okay in order to handle excess amount of free radical damage and oxidation which makes you look older there there are endogenous antioxidants which are antioxidants that your body makes okay and then there antioxidants which you get from food okay so if you need to consume a lot of greens and vegetables to get those antioxidants but your own body has antioxidant networks which increase when you exercise which increase when you do fasting so fasting helps you with just about every aspect of looking youthful and so every time you do fasting you actually increase antioxidants internally pretty cool now i combination of glucose and protein and glucose and fat but just glucose in general okay consuming a high carb diet is probably the fastest way to look older because if you ever take a look at a diabetic boy they age so fast the sugar is like rust and it oxidizes not just the inside of your arteries and the eye and the nerves and the brain and the kidney but your skin it old and every time you consume glucose of any kind you also at the same time block vitamin c the chemistry of vitamin c is very similar to glucose and so you which is another powerful antioxidant and you antioxidants from your body when you consume sugar and like vitamin b1 which is also an antioxidant and you basically just making your skin look really really old very fast and of course if you smoke you antioxidants and vitamins especially vitamin c that the requirement or demand for antioxidants and vitamin c and other vitamins go way up if you putting all this pollution internally so one way to age prematurely is just just keep smoking so if your smoker do whatever you can to you know kick the habit but in the meantime if you making this transition and you say you coming off alcohol which is another way to age very fast you want to take a lot of antioxidants not from a pill but from food you want to consume a lot of greens to and do a lot of fasting and do all the things that i to counter all this free radical damage that occurring in the body now another point i want to bring up is this thing called stress stress puts your body into two situations one it puts your body into a glucose situation where your your body is now tapping into glucose things into glucose so even though you got off carbs you a lot of stress so that then the other thing is that it creating a catabolic or a breakdown effect of proteins your skin so one way to age is just to go through a lot of stress so you work hard at countering the amount of stress in our environment unfortunately you can counter it and slow it down you can actively and aggressively do continue regular exercise you can do a lot of fasting both intermittent and prolonged fasting you can do physical work which is probably one of the best ways to counter stress you can work on improving your sleep okay and one really great technique is to control your breathing start breathing through your nose especially when you sleeping and slow down your breathing i i have a really good video on that if you haven down below but controlled breathing can pull you out of a panic attack and really keep your stress under control but stress is another factor that i need to bring up because it important thing the other point i want to bring up is protein you want to make sure the protein is quality so organic grass-fed well caught fatty fish seafood is important for quality proteins as well as trace minerals which help the skin then we have pasture-raised eggs very very important versus the commercial eggs then you have wild caught animal products and then we also get to the amount of protein a healthy ketogenic plan is a moderate amount of protein it protein diet what do you think happens when you consume excessive amounts of protein that you converting into body proteins well that protein is then used for fuel and it your body so it overdo it on the protein if you want to look youthful so i just a moderate amount a real simple rule of thumb would be the amount of protein on the palm of your hand times two if you or just times one if you to keep it really really simple that would be a moderate amount of protein and then the last point i want to bring up is your microbiome your microbes in your gut help make fat fatty acids called short chain fatty acids which are really important in controlling blood sugars in making your insulin more sensitive in getting rid of insulin resistance they also make vitamins b vitamins they also make factors that help your immune system and decrease inflammation and on top of that they make secondary bile so they help you make bile which is also very very important in the extraction of the fat type of vitamins so having a really good microbiome is so essential in that youthful look and one of the best foods for establishing this microbiome is fermented vegetables so like the sauerkraut probably the best food for your skin but there are other types of things like pickles and other fermented vegetables that are very very important because they give you the prebiotic and the probiotic at the same time all right i packed a lot of information in this video i hope you took notes watch it again implement the stuff for that youthful look but the next most important video to watch is on autophagy so check it out i put it right here	Success
Shrink Your ENLARGED PROSTATE and Fix Urine Flow	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU3LO6wbZAU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	boy this large prostate situation is extremely common as the man ages one out of two that will get an enlarged prostate and this is called benign prostatic hyperplasia which basically means an enlarged prostate now before i get into what to do because this is actually not a terribly complex problem if you understand it and also there i first differentiate what is the difference between bph and cancer of the prostate are they similar they pretty different in cancer you have these normal cells that then get damaged specifically the mitochondria and then they switch over to cancer cells okay and so with prostate cancer that can spread through the body and it can kill you it with bph it to spread it cancer it is not deadly now with the symptoms of prostate cancer you to get blood in the urine you get blood in the semen you painful urination you difficult time with an erection you may have pain with ejaculation and so the symptoms are are very different than bph where really this involves just the urinary tract mostly you up to the night and want to urinate you may have the urge to urinate but can urinate or you can bladder so it bph you just have a lot of different urination issues simply because the prostate is a gland and it wraps around the urethra which is a little tube from your urinary bladder that comes out through your penis and as the prostate enlarges it obstructs the tube and you freely all the urine that come out through the urinary bladder so you and stop and have dribbling and all sorts of issues but the prostate should only be the size of a walnut but it can actually get quite large now with the prostate cancer a big question is will phytonutrients specifically phytoestrogens make things worse there are certain compounds in herbs and vegetables that mimic estrogens okay they phytoestrogens and we know estrogen dominance in general can cause cancer in women breast cancer and also men as well and a lot of the chemicals in the environment mimic estrogen like the pesticides insecticides herbicides fungicides heavy metals they considered estrogen disruptors or endocrine disruptors but when we get to plant-based estrogens like phytoestrogens there with phytoestrogens you can prevent prostate cancer you can slow down the progression if you have prostate cancer in the early stages but if you stage of three or four or more you may want to hesitate because there is some data that these phytoestrogens can actually make things worse but i want to make a side note the studies that i read on this were relating to castrated males so if someone advanced stages of cancer they should not consume any phytoestrogens even in small amounts because it can make things worse however the purpose of this video is to focus more on enlarged prostate so let about that so there theories about why men develop a benign prostatic hyperplasia and based on all the data that i both of these series are true and they both work together the first theory has to do with as a man ages okay their testosterone goes down and both men and women have both testosterone and estrogen and so as a man ages as their testosterone goes down their estrogen goes up in relationship so they have this ratio of lowered testosterone and higher estrogen that and if anything can be said about bph it is that it factors of aging so number one we have lower testosterone and higher levels of estrogen and estrogen makes things grow especially the prostate estrogen also can cause your pituitary to trigger another hormone called prolactin that can also enlarge the prostate as one ages many times they gain more weight they have more fat and the more fat you have the more estrogen you a certain enzyme that will convert your testosterone to estrogen and that enzyme is called aromatase and this happens in both men and women and if your liver is in damage let have a fatty liver or you have cirrhosis scar tissue the liver you generate more estrogen i to tell you this if you like to drink beer but alcohol especially beer will affect the liver in that you going to raise your estrogen levels a lot higher than your testosterone so alcohol in general lower your testosterone and raise your estrogen okay the other thing that i want to mention and this is this is important to understand there estrogen okay you got estrogen one two and three and these estrogens out there they kind of connect to these little receptors okay in different parts of the body it that can enlarge the prostate not estrogen one or estrogen three and all those phytoestrogens those plant-based compounds that affect estrogen only affect estrogen number one not two not three so phytoestrogens do not enlarge a prostate however they do attempt to go into the receptors in estrogen ii and end up blocking them so other types of estrogen cannot create the effect so they help lower the estrogen too which indirectly protects you against this prostate enlargement problem so when you hear all this information out there about plant-based estrogens enlarging your prostate it not true it right the second part of this puzzle involves testosterone as your testosterone decreases you also have a powerful form of testosterone called dht okay that increases dhc is responsible for hair loss it also responsible for the enlargement of your prostate so as you age you have lower testosterone and higher levels of dht those people that have genetic problems where they can never develop in a large prostate so the question is what well this relates to another enzyme okay the name of that enzyme is called 5-alpha reductase and if you have too much of that enzyme you too much dht and that could potentially enlarge your prostate all right so now that you know both mechanisms uh what can we do about it okay well the first strategy is to start consuming more phytoestrogens okay that you and there genenstein that a lot of people take for an enlarged prostate and genisan is a phytoestrogen that it can help with this enlarged prostate uh the next thing is cruciferous vegetables kale broccoli brussels sprouts cabbage all increase the amount of phytoestrogens in the body so you should start eating those foods on a regular basis they will not increase the estrogen number two they prevent other things from entering into that receptor that can cause enlarged prostate now the next two strategies involving blocking those two enzymes one of the enzymes called aromatase and that testosterone into estrogen okay and that cells and so you want to take aromatase inhibitors okay now certain medications for the prostate do it synthetically i recommend doing the natural versions of that and believe it or not i released a video recently by blending the entire lemon the lemon peel the white part the seeds everything every morning with some stevia and you blend it in some water and drink that apparently citrus peels okay from lemons and limes can act as an aromatase inhibitor so if you haven down below it and it c and other things as well another really powerful aromatase inhibitor is stinging nettle root i like stinging nettle root a lot because it anti-inflammatory as well so if you have arthritis definitely want to take that one and then the other one is dim okay dim is a concentrated cruciferous compound that you can take as a supplement and greatly help in the balance of excessive amounts of estrogen and then the third category is to block the other enzyme called 5-alpha reductase and so you want to inhibit that enzyme and that would be by taking saw palmetto which you probably already heard that pumpkin seeds will help reduce that enzyme and green tea will reduce that enzyme and zinc will help produce that enzyme so now you know why it works but on the flip side you also want to avoid certain things too high levels of insulin can act as a growth factor for your prostate so you definitely need to go low carb as well as doing intermittent fasting i would also avoid dairy products because dairy has some estrogenic compounds and you may have already connected the dots between times that you for supper had more dairy and then that night you urination problems or having problems avoiding so dairy is a is a factor uh then we have alcohol okay if you want a good alternative for alcohol i would um try kombucha tea it to beer and it gives you a nice relaxation effect now the other point i want to bring up is plastics i whole video on this but unfortunately the plastics in our environment are mimicking estrogen and creating some serious problems especially with an enlarged prostate an average person in the u.s consumes the amount of nano plastics that would equal the size of a credit card so i do have a video on that and i put that down below as well if you filter like tap water you getting a lot of compounds that mimic estrogen as well especially those plastics so you want to get a water filter for your house and then you have the hormones and the foods right so if you many organic foods and you eat out at a fast food restaurant you are coming from the animal products that are being mimicked from the pesticides herbicides fungicides things like that now as a really simple thing that you can do right off the bat is to start including whole lemons okay in the blender with water every time you get up in the morning if you haven put it up right here check it out	Success
23 Signs Your Body Needs More Nutrients: How to Address the Deficiencies	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqLuyop6Xtc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we different signs that your body is deficient in vital nutrients now the problem with me teaching you this is you everyone you know so you have to withhold that temptation because people will be offended if you start explaining why they have these little white specks on their nails or why they might have erectile dysfunction all right now let me first just tell you the three reasons why uh people are deficient okay number one uh their guts um are damaged so they can male absorption it now it could also be that you a gallbladder or you you can vitamins vitamin a d e and vitamin k or it could be you of the right foods or the foods that you which is a big problem because the soils unfortunately are really really poor quality so if you growing food on soil that dirt you might get a really nice looking tomato but it why because the flavor chemicals are tied in with the nutrient density so we get these beautiful looking like vegetables that tastes like nothing and then you doritos and wanting other spices to try to flavor them up when in fact they should normally come there with nutrition so unfortunately the farmers sell these products based on weight and volume not nutrient dense type foods and then the third way that you become deficient is consuming refined foods and sugars that deplete you and rob you of nutrition so let list number one white spot on your nail what does that mean that is a zinc deficiency but it not really a zinc deficiency it is consuming too much sugar that robs you of zinc so if you look at your nail and you see this little white speck about halfway down the nail you know about three months ago you had a lot of sugar or refined carbohydrate like let huge birthday party and you ate the whole cake and that depleted zinc from your body creating that little white speck so you have two options you can stop eating sugar or you can take some zinc all right number two oily skin this is usually a problem with the oil glands of your body is called sebaceous glands that make something called sebum which is a type of oil and that usually occurs when you have an imbalance with androgens you androgens which is the male hormone and so one really key nutrient to regulate androgens is zinc okay so oily skin can be greatly improved if you start taking trace minerals specifically zinc now if you female and you have too many androgens you may have something called polycystic ovarian syndrome and in that case that because the carbs are too high and of course the combination of that sugar depleting zinc as well as lacking zinc and having an uncontrolled androgen situation so with oily skin you just need to take some zinc and you need to make sure that your sugar is not very high so as you can see zinc is involved with quite a few things all right number three cracking on the corners of your mouth right here or cracked back of your heels okay so that is a vitamin b2 deficiency it could also be a vitamin b3 deficiency but it definitely involves the b vitamins so the b vitamins are very very important in preventing like these small fissures okay on your skin and so if you have enough b2 or b3 you won now you see a lot of people in the winter that get these fissures in their skin and that normally comes because they don they feeds the microbes and your microbes make the b vitamins so that is a connection between crack heals cracked corners of your mouth which i used to have as a kid and it could be very easily handled by taking vitamin d or vitamin b2 in the form of nutritional yeast all right next one is flaking skin a lot of times you the nose or even the forehead where the skin is kind of like a scaling flakiness that is a deficiency of omega-3 fatty acids and that occurs because you consuming too much omega-6 fatty acids and so the essential fatty acids that our body needs because the body doesn make it is both omega-3 and omega-6 so if your ratios are off because you doing too much six in nf3 that it becomes dry flaky white little flakes usually around the nose or the forehead so you need to do two things you need to start cutting down the omega-6 fatty acids that means reduce the amount of nuts or peanut butter or chicken or fried foods or going out to restaurants or fast food all are very high in omega-6 like corn oil soy oil cotton seed oil and you need to eat more fish sardines and cod liver oil in fact cod liver oil would be the quickest thing to handle this flaking skin all right number five yellow eyes that is a jaundice situation it it could be a gallbladder problem where the where the byproducts of your red blood cells are backing up through the system through the liver and into the blood and the byproduct of these red blood cells have a yellow color okay and so if your skin or your whites of your eyes are yellow that is definitely a backup of the liver and the gallbladder and that is usually a deficiency of bile salts okay so bile salts bile salts allow the flow of stuff through the liver and through the bile ducts and if you don thickened cholesterol sludge tends to back up and you develop these white eyes so a simple remedy would be to take some purified bile salts to open up this kind of clogged drain plug to allow the body to eliminate the byproduct of red blood cells all right number six chronic cough if someone has a chronic cough they usually have a calcium deficiency so a little calcium especially at night works like magic for these chronic coughs calcium both improves the immune system but it also relaxes the throat and the larynx just like you might want to take for cramping in your calves so basically it helps something called laryngeal spasm or this tightness in the structures of your throat okay so you might want to try that the type of calcium i would recommend is calcium lactate okay not calcium carbonate and you don before you go to bed all right number seven bleeding gums or redden swollen gums okay in your mouth that is a classic vitamin c deficiency another term would be subclinical vitamin c or a very mild version of scurvy okay now in the vitamin c complex we have different parts and one part is vitamin p which is the bioflavonoids and they don that was an older term but that p stood for permeability and or vascular permeability so in other words the blood that goes through the capillaries leaks okay and if it leaks you get all sorts of issues and one being bleeding gums and you can also get nosebleeds as well but bleeding gums or red and gums is classic vitamin c deficiency so you need to consume more leafy greens as well as avoid sugar because the chemistry of sugar is almost identical to vitamin c and if the body has sugar any vitamin c that you getting from foods or a supplement will not go in the body will always take up glucose or sugar before vitamin c okay number seven number eight night vision issues so let dark or you and you know seeing clear that is a classic vitamin a deficiency or night blindness now are people usually deficient in vitamin a well around the world they are so there vitamin a deficiency simply because they cereals and refined grains and they may even be eating plant sources of vitamin a but those are precursors like beta-carotene for example they call it vitamin a but it of vitamin a called retinol retinol usually comes from animal products like dairy or butter or fish fatty fish definitely cod liver oil and animal liver like beef liver for example has a lot of vitamin a and so if you trying to get your vitamin a from plants it convert that into the active form of vitamin a which is retinol but a really good source of retinol would be egg yolks okay so if you want to have enough retinol just eat some egg yolks and you will definitely get enough and then you thing to look at with vitamin a is your ability to absorb it because maybe you don gallbladder is removed or you have some liver issue because it example then you can vitamin a because vitamin a is a fat soluble vitamin it could be one cause all right next one is chapped lips the cause of chapped lips is the same cause as cracking in the corners of the mouth or on the heels it b2 deficiency and so what would create a b2 deficiency it refined grains that are depleting b2 because naturally the b vitamins especially b2 are normally in grains but basically when you refine them they get lost so one really good thing would be to stop eating grains any grains and the second thing you want to do is start taking nutritional yeast with nutritional yeast i would always get it unfortified you spectrum of the b vitamins and you notice your skin much much better i mean if you take a look at some of the b vitamin deficiencies like real severe deficiencies you get conditions like pellegra and with pellegra you have devastating effects on your skin because b vitamins are not just about giving you energy they about helping you form uh normal tissue so it it will start using chapstick or certain type of lotions or oils on their lips but what they find is that maybe an hour later it not worse to being chapped because sometimes they put other ingredients into these products like they might put alcohol or mineral oil which pulls out a lot of the key nutrients or fats that you need to keep your skin the right texture all right next one is the pitting edema on the top of your foot or your ankles this is a deficiency of potassium okay when you don or the ratios of potassium versus sodium like sodium is way too high and potassium is way too low and by the way refined sugar causes you to retain sodium and deplete potassium that diabetics a lot many times have so much sugar in their blood that they get a lot of swelling especially in the ankles and the feet and if you push your finger into the foot or the ankle it leaves a dent okay now believe it or not when i had blood sugar issues a long ago in my mid-30s i used to have pitting edema and i didn press into my ankle i that dent that was a severe potassium deficiency so you want to start eating foods high in potassium okay and that would be any of the leafy greens but you need volumes you need large salads things like that that will give you enough potassium versus consuming more salt okay salt okay as long as you have enough potassium or you might want to get a quality electrolyte with a lot of potassium but that will push fluid out of the ankles very very quickly now next one is craving ice okay if you chances are you okay you see this with kids sometimes you see this with females who are going through their menstruation where they losing blood and iron and they becoming anemic they start eating more ice they unfortunately ice doesn so you end up still deficient the best sources of the iron that you need is red meat you can get it from liver you can get it from eggs and for some reason if you can can also get them in a supplement but not an iron supplement i would recommend a supplement that is either a grass-fed liver extract or believe it or not there are spleen extract products that are loaded with iron okay so that all right next one is angina that chest pain so that is where the heart is cramping and your heart is having an attack and usually it arm that is a classic vitamin e deficiency there about vitamin e what creates a deficiency usually is refined grains okay as in the breads the pasta the cereal the crackers the biscuits when you consume those products that normally have a good amount of vitamin e in it but when they add chlorine to bleach it they oxidize it and they kill all the vitamin e when they when it sits on the shelf all that vitamin e is lost and then when you consume those products it creates a vitamin e deficiency the most important tissue for vitamin e is the inside of your arteries and if you don a lot of rusting and oxidation and you start getting clots the formation of calcium and all sorts of things that come in there so vitamin e is very very important and so the best way to prevent vitamin e deficiency is to stop doing the refined grains and if you want a very good vitamin e i would get the type that tocotrinol not a tocopherol the tocotrienols work about 50 times stronger than the tocopherols and so it really is great for angina type chest pain all right number 13 leg or calf cramps that is a magnesium deficiency okay where do you get magnesium well it do you get chlorophyll from green plants okay so again we to that salad where you get good amount of magnesium there there chlorophyll other things but when you get light cramps chances are you probably missing magnesium you need more and they usually go away there deficiencies that might lead to cramps like potassium even sodium vitamin b1 and i but the most common one is the magnesium deficiency all right number 14 irritability excessive thinking feeling nervous tension even grouchy or angry is a b1 deficiency if you take a little nutritional yeast if you you out you you like you a lot better also before you go to bed if you have excessive thinking just take some nutritional yeast before you go to bed and that you can get it in tablets as well i below for more information but you talk about turning off that excessive mind thinking solving all the problems of the world which prevents you from sleep it really nice to be able to go to bed and not have to solve a million problems so you can drift off and sleep all right 15. asthma asthma is a situation where you have inflammation in the lungs and this can be greatly improved with vitamin d so if you which most asthmatics are boy that can just reduce inflammation and help you breathe this is why during the summer months when kids that have asthma they sun their symptoms go away there very very important video on a breathing method that can help asthma i that down below if you haven but there breathing to pull someone out of an asthmatic attack you know within minutes so you can check that out 16 loss of the outer eyebrows okay this is usually a thyroid problem or an iodine deficiency situation where they hormones because when you get to like t4 t3 you of iodine molecules in that thyroid hormone t4 is an inactive thyroid hormone t3 is the active form because the body strips off an iodine molecule so if you don t3 then you could potentially lose the outer eyebrows as one of the symptoms so if you don have the outside just take some iodine in the form of seek help that the best sources tightness in the right trap area right through here okay all the way through here if you have tightness right there suspect gallbladder and suspect a lack of bile salts if you don salts things get all kind of stuck underneath the right rib cage there little nerve called the phrenic nerve that goes right up to the right side and so if you take purified bile salts that thins the bile allows the drainage okay and all of a sudden your right trap feels loose and it feels better okay i have additional information on that i will share that in the description but tightness in the right trap 9 out of 10 times it gallbladder related because you don have enough bile and it stuck and jammed up it the system showing up in your right trap 18. nightmares one of the best ways to get rid of a nightmare is to take b1 nutritional yeast there thing in the brain called the amygdala which regulates the emotion of fear okay so it and so of course nightmares involve fear and its function is very very similar to what the adrenals are all about which is like a stress gland but it involving that emotion of fear and there you take more b1 thymine uh boy does that just chill a person out and they feel better and they don nightmares anymore so if your kids have nightmares give them a little nutritional yeast but the real question is why are they deficient because they carbohydrates in the form of all the refined grains the breads the pasta the cereal the crackers those things as well as sugar so you need to handle that as well 19. craving for salty chips at night if your body is deficient in sodium okay you but if you the need for sodium goes up and so one of the symptoms or signs of a salt deficiency or a sodium deficiency is craving for salt okay so if you craving for salt at night in the form of chips the next day i would start to increase the amount of sea salt and not sodium chloride in your diet okay so start beefing that up putting on your food maybe even putting some in some water and drinking that where you get to the point at night you no longer crave salty chips okay then we know you have enough and so for years i had this false idea that salt was bad and i rarely consumed salt so i always ate foods lacking salt lacking fat of course at night i was downing all these chips and salty popcorn and salty doritos but during the day i was pretty much salt free so i had no concept of nutrition or this whole idea that salt was not bad if it was in the form of sea salt and if i had enough potassium okay i didn you you need to balance out your electrolytes by adding more sea salt and make sure you have enough potassium as well but you will find those cravings will go away all right number 20 stiff low back or low back pain is usually a vitamin d deficiency especially if it you need to do is take some good amount of vitamin d or you can even make your own vitamin d i below if you haven video but vitamin d is one of the best things to get rid of inflammation fast anywhere in the body especially in the lower back i would recommend taking at least 10 000 international units per day and it might be beneficial to take it right before bed or at a meal because if you take it right before bed it actually enhances your sleep and if you take it with meals it type of vitamin d i recommend is my own brand and of course i but i am sarcastic but in my vitamin d i have i put the k2 in there i put the mct oil so that way you don extra oil everything gets absorbed nicely all right the next one is 21 you normally most people don but sometimes kids crave dirt okay or even women that are menstruating losing blood anemic are craving dirt what they is iron even if you your dog crave starts eating dirt they need iron okay and the best source of iron is red meat it gives you the the best form of iron that versus consuming spinach things like that so if you have anemia or you need iron red meat would be the best thing to take or some liver with onions of course all right number 22 erectile dysfunction that deficiency of zinc zinc is one of the best things to increase testosterone and handle this symptom and lastly 23 depression if someone they vitamin d greatly boosts serotonin which is a neurotransmitter and so it prozac without the side effects so if you depressed boy just give them a little vitamin d and just see how fast their mood elevates another thing to try as a side note is to start to do more fasting that really elevates the mood as well now if you haven on how to figure out liver problems check that out i put it right here	Success
How to STOP Flatulence (Farting): THIS REALLY WORKS!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roR2cqChkcM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we stop flatu now the average person according to they uh farts between five to 15 times a day with no odor now you might be sitting down there saying I fart more than that or I fart less than that or I don an average person so it saying the average person consumes 145 pounds of sugar per year Well I consume zero sugar in a year so some people consume a tremendous amount and some a small amount but we looking at the average but an average person expels gas at a frequency between 5 to 15 a day now there your life that you may have experienced this more depending on what you eat for example if you this thing called Hormel chili for example um you may experience more flat TNS I know for me I had a problem in my late 20s when I was trying to become a vegan for a few months it didn you have a problem now I you exactly what to do to resolve it now since we to bring up cow farts and burps okay because if you do a search on flatrent uh the first I don many pages will talk about how cows are farting and burping and releasing about 160 to 320 liters of methane per day and that warming etc etc but if you actually dig into all the data and research you going to find some real interesting things about that that counter uh that theory and give you some of the data that they going to put that research down below but between 1990 and 2007 the global cattle and buffalo population increased by a factor of 125 million extra cows and buffalo on this planet and during that period of time there was Zero increase in methane but this data is always omitted when they again when you information you really need to have all the information to come up with the right conclusion there are many other things that are much bigger in contributing to more methane than cows all right so what causes flatu well we have certain fiber that you eat certain carbohydrates that you eat in the form of sugar starches okay that are then fermented so microbes are acting on these fibers and sugars and they eating them that byproduct hydrogen is released and then methane is also released now this process should occur in your large intestine it should not occur in the small intestine when it does you get what bacterial overgrowth and that can create a lot of gas and a lot of problems and one of the causes for sibo is a lack of stomach acid in fact one of the big causes of gas in general is a lack of stomach acid as we get older we lose the acidity in our stomach if we take antibiotics we start losing the stomach acid if we take ant acids we lose the stomach acid there that we contribute to less stomach acid now if we don stomach between like one and three which is very very acidic food gets undigested and uh if it undigested everything below the stomach has a more difficult time breaking that food down and that creates all sorts of strain and stress on the enzyme production from your pancreas from the gall blood releasing bile uh from the small intestine to do its work and then you can start getting fermentation in the small intestine and again that called sibo and this is where a person can starts consuming fiber okay even from vegetables and they really just blow up like a balloon and they they well I why do I feel so bad they can have very severe bloating and pain and very severe gas simply because you have these bacteria that are in the wrong place and we place so here stomach acid ban hydrochloride the chloride contributes and improves the hydrocloric acid okay so this breaks down and helps you build up your stomach acid it works great um these come in tablets um you can take take a couple okay it might make a slight difference but I always recommend take a little bit more because sometimes you might need six seven eight at a time to create the effect that you want especially in the beginning and over time you and less and less because your body will start just making more to the point where you don uh help building your stomach acid and I also recommend a couple um herbs that are really good for digestion Ginger really really good uh for not just helping you with gas but to help release bile to help release enzymes and also to help with any type of spasms going on in the small intestine or tightness so it just allows you to relax more in that area so you can digest uh any type of mint is really good for digestion and fenel now what about apple ceter vinegar is that good well if you actually look up some of the credible sites on Google it says that drinking upside of vinegar will help you with digestion but my opinion is I don there I patients it works on a lot of people and who research on apple cider vinegar unless you own an appleid of vinegar company uh no one instead most of the money in researching digestive problems is going to be funded by medication who can afford to spend money on research on digestive problems pharmaceutical companies Not Your Average Joe that wants to do a study in apple cider vinegar but there is some research on acetic acid and slowing your digestion down uh so the enzymes in your small intestine can start acting on the food and contribute to more complete digestion and So the faster the food goes through your digestive system uh the less complete the digestion is going to be I mean just think about if someone has diarrhea right Fuko through you undigested but if there can slow down the digestion like apple cider vinegar and consuming enough fat at the meal the rest of the digestive juices can act on that food and really break it down to the point where you don extra methane and bloating and other related symptoms so both pan H chloride and alider vinegar are really good to reduce flat T and hopefully get rid of it completely all right now let about food intolerances like lactose intolerance right this is not a true allergy but you because you don break down this milk sugar so anything Dairy can create a lot of gas a lot of people have a problem with this now you can take enzymes for that um or just avoid Dairy then you have gluten a lot of people have an allergy to gluten and some people don intolerance for gluten and that can create a lot of gas bloating pain arthritis Etc so the good thing about what I recommend is if you keto you about it because you consuming gluten or grains for that matter but for any type of intolerances you can always take more enzymes you can also take probiotics to help fortify the microbes so they can make more enzymes uh I found a lot of people that have food allergies if they take certain probiotics they can actually she reduced her food allergies okay then we have what fruit is a big one right uh beans legumes starches like potato rice uh things like that grains sugars certain cruciferous vegetables like brussels sprouts okay broccoli cabbage then you have like onions and garlic these are very gas producing for certain people other people can consume them without a problem but if you are on the ketogenic plan you you going to do starches you do sugar so you shape now if you have a problem with cruciferous vegetables there are other vegetables that will not produce gas like lettuce tomato zucchini olives and avocado okay so just eat more of these right here I will say when I recommend the healthy version of the erogenic diet I recommend that people consume a lot more greens and salads and vegetables however um for some people um they they don much fiber so you want to go slow and you want to gradually go into it uh but a good percentage of the people just jump right in they have a really big salad each day and there but the benefit of the fiber to feed the microbes as well as the potassium the magnesium the vitamin C and all those phalut nutrients can greatly help a person and take their health to a whole new level all right number four sugar alcohols when someone starts the ketogenic diet uh inevitably they going to be really into all these really cool desserts you can now have and make uh with these little keto cookies and they have little bars and they with these ketofriendly fiber like corn fiber and other fibers like dextrin that are considered keto friendly that create a lot lot of gas for people inulin might create a lot of gas and it different ketofriendly products inulin is a type of fiber and then you have the sugar alcohols like arrol zotol manitol which for a lot of people can produce a lot of gas so you will quickly find out if you can tolerate uh these sugar alcohols once you start the ketogenic plan I think a lot of people when they start keto they go overboard and just consume a lot of the stuff um I would just recommend testing the waters do a little bit um I use zotol non GMO um on a regular basis in my coffee I coffee each day I problem whatsoever but I just wanted to bring up sugar alcohols because that is definitely one source of flatu number five chewing gum especially if you have your mouth open you can be swallowing a lot of air eating with your mouth open okay okay you can swallow a lot of air and that could end up with some gas so eat with your mouth closed and if you going to chew gum keep your mouth closed all right number six carbonation right now there flavored water drinks out there that can add more gas in the system and end up with flatu now before you go there very interesting video on apple cider vinegar that I have to check this out if you haven seen it before I put it right

How to Cure Hiccups (INSTANTLY!) - Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHVAwRW10Ww	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let almost instantly now what is the hiccup well the diaphragm which connects the upper cavity from the abdominal cavity right here these two muscles um goes into spasm and that interrupts your vocal cords creating a hick sound okay so that what it is triggers involve laughing excessive talking i remember in the past when i prepared for a talk right i would practice right before my live presentation i would be practicing what i and sometimes i and then i would get the hiccups and now i have to wait for a period of time before they go away because you can hiccups i really wish i would have known what to do back then but i show you what to do but if you too fast you can get these hiccups if you hiccups and so people tell you that oh yeah you just need to hold your breath drink water upside down breathe into a paper bag or breathe really slowly okay and your hiccups will go away now the question is do any of these work but the bigger question is what is causing this problem you know a solution depends on really understanding the problem and medicine it treating it there understanding the problem so you can actually fix the root cause but it root causes it the symptom and let the symptom and let solution that only lasts for 24 hours so you have to keep taking the solution over and over now before i get into how to fix this i just want to explain how i approach figuring out things okay let called gerd which is a condition where your valve on the top of the stomach is not closing and you the acid squirts up through into the esophagus so what i normally do to figure out something is i will take the symptom or the problem and compare it to normal physiology that happens in this area of the body so in a normal situation when you eat the valve on the top of the stomach should close right but with gerd it acid comes back up and then they treat it with antacids or ppi of medication so when i try to figure this out i want to know the mechanism i want to know what is patho means disease and physiology is how things actually work so i normal physiology of the stomach and pathophysiology of gerd to see if i could really understand what and then come up with a solution now with gerd i found some very interesting information that that the valve has sensors for ph okay normally the ph of the stomach should be extremely acid between one and three but with gerd i found some data that the ph is higher it as acid and so apparently what happening with gerd is that valve is not sensing that the ph is one to three and it eat so that data tells me that what we need to do with gerd is add more acid to the stomach and that practice and it worked like a charm would give people either retain hydrochloride or apple cider vinegar and boom gone i mean think about it antacids and ppis given to people who have acid reflux or gerd or heartburn have a side effect and one of the side effects of antacids nppis is gerd and heartburn and acid reflux so anyway i just wanted to explain how i figure these things out because this relates to hiccups there was a fascinating research study that i had to really dig to find this study and it was done in cats okay this is what they found this is interesting hiccups stopped immediately when the co2 carbon dioxide pressure in the veins equals the co2 pressure in the arteries okay now to make this very simple hiccups stop when you increase co2 okay that is very very counterintuitive doesn unless you understand something if someone gets too much oxygen in their blood without enough co2 that oxygen doesn or get released like it should and the person basically starves of oxygen now how does that relate to hiccups well guess what what laughing you excessive talking you of oxygen eating too fast you a lot of oxygen when you lot of times you getting too much oxygen and this also explains why holding your breath increases co2 making those hiccups go away when you drinking upside down you your breathing okay getting more co2 less oxygen look what breathing into a bag you breathing your carbon dioxide it carbon dioxide that then balances out this excess amount of oxygen and allows the oxygen to finally be bound and released into the bloodstream and into the muscles like the diaphragm when people have too little co2 okay their ph changes and becomes more alkaline in alkalosis everything gets really really tight you get spasms it affects your breathing and so one symptom of alkalosis is hiccups and then hiccups caused by too much oxygen can then trigger more alkalosis so it vicious circle so hiccups are caused by too much oxygen and not enough co2 and the best way to get rid of them very very fast is to increase co2 by doing any of these right here in fact if you have a bag and breathe into it that would work very nicely or you can just breathe through your nose not your mouth by slowing your breath down five seconds in and five seconds out you can even hold your breath any one of these will work as long as you understand you don oxygen you want to get less oxygen and more co2 so if you have that key understanding which is right here then you can you can be creative you can actually wear a mask right and uh increase your co2 that way so anyway the next time you get a hiccup or someone else around you gets a hiccup now you know exactly what to do now i talked a little bit about this in my video on panic attacks which i give you a much greater understanding about this co2 oxygen thing i would highly recommend checking out that video if you haven it up right here	Success
Do We REALLY Have 5 to 20 lbs of Toxic Poop in Our Colons?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1PmXfvCRd4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you ever hear this idea that we have 5 to 10 to 20 pounds of toxic poop stuck in our colons so today we to talk about if that or if there have done every cleanse that has ever been invented i colemas which is a combination of an enema and a colonic which was invented by bernard jensen who wrote the book on colon cleansing i went to his home he lived in a trailer in san diego and i bought his kits and i of his colonics over the years and looking back at that the problem was i never fixed my diet so you seven-day kind of a colema cleanse where you morning at night and then you eating any food you psyllium seed apple juice which is filled with sugar and a bunch of vitamins and literally i was starving because my blood sugars were up and down because of the apple juice i never got into ketosis and i was just dreaming about eating a pizza because they never told you to consume electrolytes or sea salt so i was so craving something salty and little did i know i was very deficient in sodium and that was actually quite dangerous to drink all this fluid and then to eliminate all this fluid so you really need to know what you going to do a colon cleanse now how much toxic material is actually in someone could it be 5 10 20 pounds maybe with some people but i don average i think the average person who eliminates between 14 to 16 ounces of poop a day usually does not have an impacted colon or constipation now that know a lot of people do have constipation and they could be holding a lot more waste however i do not think it 10 or even 20 pounds now in practice there was one lady who came to see me that was severely constipated she was going to the bathroom once a month i not kidding and so yes she probably had more than 20 pounds of impacted poop in her gut but of course when i did the evaluation i found that her diet wasn and after i got done explaining what to eat uh she left and i never saw her again but when she checked out at my front desk i went to lunch and i went outside and i saw her car there and i walked by her car and i happened to notice in the back seat it was filled with empty wrappers of burger king mcdonald kfc i mean she didn garbage she stuck him in the back seat so i think that had something to do possibly with um her constipation problem as well as your toxicity but i think the average person has this idea that stool or waste is always toxic maybe because it has an unpleasant smell but think about what having billions of microbes breaking down your food and if the diet is poor you going to have more of one microbe than another and those microbes give off certain gases that then have bad odor but if someone fairly healthy and they correctly they should not produce those very unpleasant gases that other people might produce even when someone has really bad breath whether it breath that smell is not coming from toxins it certain microbes that the person has an overgrowth and it or yeast or or fungus that are producing that bad odor and you know some people have this idea that they just need to flush out and cleanse all this waste so then they can be healthy and clean but what happens when you out all these microbes doing a colonic or some herbal laxative you this friendly bacteria that you need to help you digest the food it like taking antibiotic one of the big side effects is constipation we depend on these microbes to help us especially with the consistency of our stool as well as the frequency as well you know just like if you going to make a compost pile that material in the compost cannot break down unless you have like manure like animal waste which has all the microbes if the microbes are not in that material it will just sit there it will not break down it won we really need these microbes and mostly in the large intestine to help us break down things so in the digestive system we have a lot of things that help us break food down we have the stomach acids we have the enzymes that are produced by our stomach in our pancreas and by our small intestine that act on the food in the small intestine we have help from the liver and the gallbladder producing the bile that helps us break down fat so all these things contribute to helping breaking down food and then having it end up as a waste but you have to realize that that waste product is alive it over a hundred billion microbes just in one gram and 100 million viruses per gram and when you loads can go up to a trillion per gram but these viruses i friendly viruses that keep the bacteria in check they don kill bacteria to prevent the overgrowth of bacteria so you have this interesting balancing mechanism the point is that we need these microbes desperately in the absorption of food and for our immune system and for many other reasons like making vitamins but most of the microbes are in the large intestine and as things work you have this very long tube from your stomach all the way down to the rectum that is acting on this food when you eat and normally at any given time you should have about like one pound of of material going through your system because think about what happening this food is constantly breaking down and being absorbed okay because a lot of food has water in it for example like even steak is over 50 water and the body is reabsorbing all this material through the small intestine so 90 of the digestion occurs in the small intestine so it amino acids fatty acids vitamins minerals carbohydrates it out through the layer of your small intestine and even a large intestine too and it lymphatic system in your circulatory system so just because you consume one pound of food it doesn pound of waste and then when the undigested particles end up in the large intestine the microbes act on those and turn those into a certain type of fat small chain fatty acids that give you energy that feed your colon that help your blood sugars so you have this incredibly dynamic activity that or pumping action it peristalsis that material through this digestive system and have each part do a different thing certain parts of your small intestine for example will start to absorb trace minerals for example certain parts of the digestive system also help reabsorb bile salts which by the way give the stool its color brown if you don vital salts your stool becomes lighter or pale or gray colored or even tan also if there things become more constipated if there looser you get diarrhea so all of these different factors can act on the material that system having diverse types of fibers like different types of vegetables can help increase the different microbes if you eating one vegetable only your microbes are not going to be as diversified and so if someone need to look at microbes like probiotics as well as fiber but i metamucil or psyllium husk talking about actual food fiber from vegetables and when i talking about a probiotic you can do probiotics in foods like sauerkraut for example has a lot of good bacteria other fermented vegetables other fermented dairy like kefir or you can buy a good probiotic now to be totally transparent i do sell a high quality probiotic but you can find a probiotic anywhere just make sure it survives the stomach so there important things you need to understand about this topic number one the solution to either constipation or diarrhea always relates to your diet so if you are constipated and you more vegetable fiber to your diet and that doesn a probiotic and it still doesn i a herbal laxative because that better than a medication but just realize the underlying cause of that constipation definitely relates to your diet there diet maybe you need more bile salts because your liver is too fatty and it can need more stomach acids or for example more sea salt which is sodium chloride to help you build more hydrochloric acid or even you need more enzymes because the pancreas is too exhausted because of the constant introduction of carbohydrates so anyway i wanted to clear up some of these interesting ideas people had in relationship to toxic poop and to give you the understanding that not everyone has you know pounds and pounds of toxic material in their colon that they need to flush out with a pill you really need to figure out the diet because that really the ultimate correction of digestive problems now if you haven seen my video on how to use foods to detoxify your liver i put that up

The Fastest Way to Stop Tinnitus: Dr. Berg's 30-Second Technique to Silence Ringing in the Ears	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MDO8KB3zjk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we technique on how to stop tinnitus or you can pronounce it tinnitus now this technique was not developed by me it was developed by a dr j stratum and i did a video on this about four or five years ago yet many people have never seen it and they can it but i want to quickly just share a few of the success stories from this video and these are just right in the comments so check this out the first comment i morning was real bad and i just found this video i immediately tried it instant relief it but i do feel better next one i problems with this for years having worked for many years as a musician with loud groups i rated my right ear as a five before the experiment and after four repetitions i could not perceive any difference however after eight reps the volume of tinnitus in my right ear has diminished somewhat and the top searing end of the pitch has gone completely gives me hope thanks for the video here ringing in my ears for at least 10 years i swear i went from a seven or an eight to a two or three after doing this routine three times all right here oh my god i for three plus years this lesson the ringing after the fourth round gonna keep it going thanks all right and here share with you i could honestly cry this actually helped me i was just about to lose my mind and start panicking and it actually went away thank you so much all right so very simply what is tinnitus well it perception of hearing a noise when there isn for tinnitus means to ring and the latin word for noise means nausea disgust discomfort hurting injury and damage so tonight this can be actually devastating if you this high pitch ringing or sound in your ear and it can go beyond a minor annoyance and be a major situation that could literally just destroy your life so let me explain this technique tinnitus really is not a problem in the ear itself it that connects to the brain so you have these receptors in your ears that are receiving sound waves and then your ear converts those vibrations into electrical impulses that are then interpreted by the brain as certain pitches so there connects the inner ear to the part of the brain that interprets sound called the auditory cortex and that nerve is called the eighth cranial nerve so i going to show you how to reset the nerve and turn off the noise now i did modify this technique slightly okay but i put a link down below of the person who developed a technique so you can get more data if you want but what you to be tapping with your fingers you going to take your index finger over your middle finger okay i you snapping them like this okay on the back part of your skull now there back part of your skull that a line from your ear and draw it right in the back part okay that you okay so you fingers and you you know tap like like this you to snap your fingers down and tap the back of your skull and so what you going to do is you signals into the eighth range nerve to send it into the brain so apparently there is some short circuiting going on or a glitch in the brain before you do this please please please rate from a scale from 0 to 10. 10 being a major major problem 0 being no problem at all so go ahead and do that right now in fact put that in the comments section and then after you do this technique then re-rate it so i can see your results and so can everyone else so now that you have a before number you start tapping you times okay 20 times so pause the video right now as you tap the back part of your skull 20 times okay now the next step is you going to re-rate that perception of that noise okay so did it decrease from the original number go ahead and write that down so basically you doing the series of tapping motions in the back of your skull and then re-rating the intensity of the noise roughly eight times or eight cycles because as you read in one of the success stories someone didn improvement until they times so eight times of 20 taps now if you okay you every day a few times a day until it let improvement well then there could be some other cause for this because it doesn thing i this does not work is to find a product called benfotamine i don you want to take a hundred and fifty milligrams three times a day benfotamine is a fat soluble vitamin b1 that helps to penetrate the brain and sometimes people can develop um problems from insulin resistance okay because they have a problem with their nervous system because this condition affects the nerves okay and it can also affect the autonomic nerves the peripheral nerves in your feet and your hands as well as the nerve in the inner ear so ben photomine can sometimes help if you have the condition of insulin resistance and that anyway try this technique comment down below to see how it helped you so we can all read the success stories and if you have not seen my video on benfotamine or b1 i put it up right here check it out	Success
What CAUSES Tonsil Stones and How to Prevent Them	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1YQjA758Gc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now about 10 of the population gets these little stones in their tonsils and so today we going to talk about how to prevent tonsil stones and then if you get tonsil stones and you go to your dentist and they remove them how to prevent them from coming back now to understand tonsil stones we have to understand what the tonsil is the tonsil is in a first line of defense it node it it going deeper inside the body and tonsils produce t cells which is part of the immune system and so they will capture detect and then start developing a defense against a certain microbe that might be in your mouth or in your environment so that are and the stone part are basically something called biofilms okay biofilms and biofilms are little calcium igloos that microbes specifically with this situation it these little cement-like igloos and that what they are they houses to protect them from being destroyed by antibiotics and so a biofilm is a shield it mechanism to help these microbes survive and these microbes also produce a gas like a sulfur gas that people that have tonsil stones have a bad odor in their mouth like sometimes rotten eggs they might have a metallic taste they might get a cough and these stones usually develop after kind of a chronic tonsillitis or being on antibiotics for a period of time because that will wipe out your defenses and then increase your pathogens and i keep hitting this point across over and over my videos you have all this good bacteria it microbiome and you don of it you don you kill it off with antibiotics you better replace it because these microbes help defend against pathogens and other microbes that make biofilms so anything that increases chronic tonsillitis will increase these biofilms so if a person was on steroids if they consume a lot of sugar if they vitamin d deficient all these factors weaken your immune system and increase the chance of getting these stones and biofilms are not just living in the crevices of your tonsils they like 59 of sinus infections they involved in ear infections they involved in utis they infections throughout the body so it is a major defense mechanism that certain pathogens use to survive so there are three things to do as remedies to help prevent these things from coming back and this mainly is going to act as a natural antibiotic without the side effects so it kills the pathogens but it doesn guys so number one garlic you want to consume a lot of garlic okay on a regular basis number two oregano oil oregano oil is a very powerful natural antibiotic but it virtually does nothing to our good bacteria and number three and this is a real powerful one as well and i links down below that support the data that i but grape fruit seed extract okay another great natural antibiotic now of course there that contribute to this as well being on a high carb diet and consuming a lot of dairy products that can create more mucus especially if you person and you get chronic inflammation of the tonsils or ear infections or even a sinus infection anyone who has upper or lower respiratory infections needs to get off dairy now the next most important video for you to watch right now is the one on the immune system in relationship to zinc and vitamin d check it out i put it up right here	Success

Millions of Microbes Are Living in Your Mattress	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsgYXh9y0ZI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now this might be a little creepy video but there are microbes actually living in your mattress so that trying to increase your awareness because a lot of people have no idea what place that they spend one third of their life sleeping so let mites okay what are dust mites well there are small tiny tiny little microorganisms that um thrive in your mattress they thrive in your pillow so at any one time you might have 10 million of them living in your mattress and they don live on your dead skin cells and an average person will shed over a million pieces of little dead skin particles every single day and so these dust mites have plenty to eat the male dust mite lives for about 10 to 19 days but a female will live about 70 days and produce over 100 eggs and it really depends on the moisture so if your bathroom is attached to your bedroom and you take a shower and you leave the door open and you have all this moisture in there or it summer time and you leave the window open it humid that can really allow these dust mites to thrive so it may be a good idea to limit that and you might even want to get a dehumidifier but with dust mites you are the food and the big problem is the allergies people are sensitive to them and they have red eyes they might start sneezing but don tell you what to do about all this all right number two bed bugs okay you don want to let the bed bugs bite you because they do bite you the size of a bed bug is about the size of an apple seed and they can quickly on the floor on the ceiling so they and in one study they found that uh they counted how many of these bed bugs were in a mattress and they found two thousand so there that could be living in your bed and they bite you while you they have this little tube that they can inject into for about three to ten minutes and they live on your blood and so if you wake up with a little um itchy red bump it could be a bed bug all right now let fungus and bacteria but i apologize in advance i little bit but an average adult sweats 26 gallons in their bed every single year i mean that is a crazy amount of sweat coming out of your body and that breeds an environment for fungus and bacteria unfortunately there was a recent lab test done on seven-year-old mattresses and they found 16 million colony units of bacteria per inch okay so there in your mattress and this could affect you by waking up with a stuffy nose um waking up sneezing red itchy eyes and then number four we have this thing called pet dander over 50 of pet owners actually share their bed with their pet and of course pets bring in all sorts of things into the bed it source for things like fleas and ticks so you may want to consider potentially having a pet-free zone in your bed and maybe having them sleep on the floor or in another room all right and number five chemicals when your body heats up when you there are certain chemicals that get released they compounds you have an increased release of formaldehyde and many other chemicals that can be released and not to mention all the new chemicals that can occur with a new mattress so what are we going to do about this well number one regular washing of your bedding and your sheets with very hot water i would also add some baking soda in there because baking soda will kill microbes the next thing i would do is i would try to reduce humidity as much as you can keep your bathroom shut maybe keep the windows closed if it hot outside or just have a dehumidifier going on in the room avoid pet exposure if you have a problem with some of these issues get a good air purifier because if there from the bed and you have allergies that can greatly help you add the baking soda to the wash which i already mentioned and number six vacuum your mattress on a regular basis because things accumulate because you want to keep the microbial population at a minimum so i so the next video that i think you should watch is on growing certain plants in your room to increase more oxygen so you can sleep better i put it up right here check it out you	Success
Say Goodbye to Candida: The Best Ways to Cure It Permanently	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9wWC7M0QxI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	i you going to show you how to never have candida ever again and this is all based on some recent information that i stumbled on that i want to share with you because it candida candida is a type of yeast or a fungus and to really understand how to get rid of it you just have to understand exactly what it is and how it can overgrown in our body there facts that you need to know about candida number one um you normally should have some amount of candida living on your body okay in your mouth in your digestive tract and many other locations the problem with candida is when it overgrows and there are quite a few different strains of candida out there there some are more pathogenic than others and so a yeast or a candida is just one type of microorganism that is living inside your body as well as superficially you also have bacteria you also have mold and you even have viruses that actually can help you as well there they actually keep bacteria in check now with candida it candida in check and so without bacteria you overgrowth of candida and the single biggest cause is antibiotics they therapy so when you take an antibiotic it wipes out the good bacteria and now we have nothing to counter this overgrowth of yeast but there with me as a side note and this is very interesting out of all the antibiotics that are sold in the u.s nearly 80 percent of them are sold in agriculture only 20 percent are sold through like a doctor so our animals are given antibiotics not because they necessarily have some type of sickness but it allows that animal to live in a stressful environment it allows for or a dirtier environment or a less nutritious environment because if you animal it can at least temporarily lower the infection rate not to mention it will put on weight and there problem with that topic is there of secrecy in this area it um data on the sales of antibiotics and especially in the us it to track down if there was an outbreak of e coli for example or salmonella it very difficult to track where that outbreak originated from versus in europe um they do track that but in the us they don so you this e coli or salmonella come from well it comes from the manure that is put on the soils that we grow these vegetables with the manure from animals who had antibiotics who then ended up with super bugs and microbes that cannot be killed by antibiotics because the more antibiotics are given to an animal or a human you develop antibiotic resistance so this whole focus on antibiotics is not just about you taking antibiotics it animals it to animals that then create manure that we use in soils that we grow our food on so if you you don well you might be getting indirectly from the soil those plants are growing on and so the problem is everything going to sterilization we have to sterilize our food we have to radiate our food to make sure there pathogens we have to overcook our food to prevent these pathogenic microbes from going in our body and this is why even if you were to buy a chicken a commercial chicken and you cook it well when you cut it up on your cutting board there contaminated cutting board that then gets on your fingers that gets in your body and it can create food poisoning so that what are the symptoms of candida well the biggest symptom is that you have this craving for carbohydrates because candida love carbs number two you have itchiness in your private parts it could be in the vaginal area the anal area number three a white tongue it before you candida is also using up a lot of your nutrients so you deficient number five utis number six bloating and digestive issues number seven sinus congestion and number eight skin issues dermatitis it can also be athlete that and number nine achy joints those are all the symptoms of having candida now the next thing is extremely interesting candida does not like living in an acid environment it loves to live in an alkaline environment and so killing off your microbes kill off something called acidophilus that microbes so you kill those off and guess what your ph changes your ph starts to increase and you become more alkaline in your large intestine and this is a perfect environment for candida and the problem is when candida eats the sugar that the byproduct is ammonium and ammonia is very alkaline so then having candida makes the environment more alkaline for more candida to thrive in and also i forgot one more symptom about candida you might have like ammonia breath because this is a gas that is being released from the byproduct of this yeast or candida infection and you breath all right there things that will make you alkaline too consuming sugar yeah that you more alkaline not more acid this is why like a diabetic who has high sugar well first of all that high sugar is going to feed the um the candida and secondly it alkaline environment so we have the feeding of the candida and then we have the environment itself the alkalinity the next thing that makes an alkaline environment for candida to thrive in is stress that stress alkalizes the body interesting because you through stress so anything that one creates cortisol will make you more alkaline increasing the environment for candida the next thing is birth control pills as well as being pregnant both will alkalize the body increasing the environment for candida to thrive and then we also have antacids right they alkalize the body increasing your risk of candida and so all of these things can worsen candida so what can you do well number one you need to run your body on ketones ketones are acid and that will help to re-establish the ph plus going on a ketogenic diet lowers the amount of sugar which the candida thrives on so we start them off with the ketogenic diet and of course i would also along with that do intermittent fasting all right next thing is probiotics you must be taking a probiotic acidophilus included because we want to start building up the microbes to help keep the overgrowth of candida in check next thing in the list is fermented vegetables like sauerkraut or kimchi both of those products have probiotic and prebiotic fibers that feed your microbes next thing that is oregano oil garlic is also another good thing but oregano oil is a really good antimicrobial without the side effects next thing on the list is apple cider vinegar why because it is really good to help kill off candida and this is why coconut oil is also really good because it has three main acids and one of them is a very potent anti-fungal so we don coconut oil because that can also do mct oil as well so that is the six things that you need to do for candida to make sure it never ever comes back now the next video that appropriate for you to watch and i think you friendly bacteria check it out i put it up right now	Success
The #1 Worst Drink That Dissolves Your Teeth	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5BClQDK548	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let can dissolve your teeth okay i about dissolving your enamel around your teeth enamel is a very complex substance it is the hardest substance in your entire body it we look at bone the jaw bone is the hardest of all the bones and so the question is what has the capacity to dissolve this enamel and give you cavities is it just the acids or certain things in the foods well we first talk about different things that you can drink that are acidic now when i talk about acidic i goes from 1 to 14. 14 being extremely alkaline and 1 being extremely acid and right in the middle 7 you have something neutral okay so the higher the ph above 7 the more alkaline it is and the lower things are below seven the more acid things are and so if you were going to talk about a ph of one you about battery acid and then if you go up one to three we hydrochloric acid and acid in your stomach and when we distilled water we completely neutral seven mineral water is slightly above seven it can actually go up to eight sometimes even nine because of the dissolved minerals and the bicarbonates they slightly alkaline now let lemon juice lemon juice has a ph between two and three so it typically when you drink lemon water you amount of lemon juice into water you not going to basically bathe your mouth with lemons necessarily but you might but basically you tablespoon of lemon juice and put it in your water and so if we combine the water plus the lemon the ph actually rises to roughly about 5.5 now if we take apple cider vinegar which is also very acidic between two and three because of the acetic acid you straight hopefully you drink that straight you dilute it with water and the ph is going to come up to about 4.5 to maybe 5 depending on if you a tablespoon or a teaspoon and then we get into the carbonated waters right you have carbonic acid and that could fluctuate between five to five point five to maybe even six so carbonated water is slightly acidic and then we have coffee which is acidic it which roughly is about the same but maybe a little bit less acidic so 5 to 5.5 and then you have beer which is acidic we have 4 to 4.5 and then we have soft drinks like coke which is roughly between 2.4 to 3. so that so when we you start to get demineralization which means the breakdown of minerals on your teeth which are about 96 percent minerals at a ph about 5.5 but it long that your teeth are exposed to these acids so if you vinegar diluted with water or lemon or drinking coffee for a short period of time it going to chronically do it all day long so we have one variable of exposure and then we have another variable of how acid something is and then we have another variable that i want to talk about which is actually probably the most important factor and that is your own saliva now your saliva normally should be between 6.2 to 7.6 okay with an average of being slightly acidic but not too much i slava you have minerals you have sodium you have calcium you have potassium you have bicarbonates that help buffer acids you have antimicrobial factors you have immune factors you have cortisol and you have enzymes so you may drink certain things periodically through the day but really the saliva in your mouth is there chronically it the ph of your saliva is a much more important factor to buffering these acids because one of the purpose of saliva is to buffer some of the acids and also reduce the bacterial count and that factor i want to talk about the bacteria in your mouth the bacteria in your mouth it fed certain things like carbs start to ferment these carbohydrates and start to change the ph in your mouth and so the bacteria can keep your ph very acid and the bacteria are usually at the root of this dissolving of your enamel and yes you guessed it it talking about sugar that really makes your mouth very acidic not directly but indirectly because they feed the bacteria that then produce byproducts which are acidic so normally when you drink apple cider vinegar diluted or lemon water it also have all these bacteria that are constantly producing these acids in your mouth all that long and so the worst thing that you can drink that will dissolve your teeth is something with acid and sugar at the same time and yes i talking about juice especially if you a young child or even a baby the worst thing to feed a baby is juice because it the younger you are the less strong the enamel is babies are very very susceptible to having things dissolve the teeth because enamel has not developed into a very strong layer yet so you never want to give your baby juice not to mention give your baby soda which i withhold myself because sometimes people are offended if i speak up now since we if the child is consuming things like sour candy where you have a stickiness of the candy you have the sugar and then you have these candies that are very very acid like that would be very very bad to give a child and then you have the child that lollipop right constant exposure to sugar or chewing gum all day which i used to do as a child or what about sports drinks which are basically sugar water or energy drinks which are sugar water or even dried fruit all these things are going to breed more bacteria that are going to acidify your mouth and potentially dissolve your teeth and i also forgot to mention in soft drinks you have a very specific type of acid called phosphoric acid and phosphoric acid is probably the worst acid to dissolve teeth because it starts to leach out the calcium now there want to talk about number one is that you really want to look at this problem as a systemic problem if someone diabetic or a pre-diabetic or they have insulin resistance because they then we of high blood glucose which does come into the teeth indirectly through the roots your teeth have a blood supply so a lot of times people have this idea that it exposed to sugar in your mouth that is a big problem but what about internally what about the roots of the tooth if you have high blood sugars that cause of a breakdown of your tooth as well but from the inside out and also let socket that the tooth is in the gums okay which require a good amount of vitamin c because it complex help make up collagen and there between the chemistry of sugar and the chemistry of vitamin c they is consuming sugar all day or exposing their mouth to sugar the body will not absorb vitamin c at the same time so if given a choice the body will always take up sugar uh before vitamin c so in other words sugar blocks vitamin c and what do you think that fact if you ever look at someone that has bleeding gums or red swollen gums that is a classic vitamin c deficiency it even scurvy itself gingivitis and bleeding gums is a symptom of scurvy but in reality nowadays it consuming too much sugar and the vitamin c cannot be absorbed so should you be concerned about drinking apple cider vinegar and lemon in your water if it diluted well not necessarily if you on a low carb diet but you can always just use a straw to avoid the exposure of your teeth and then when you with these drinks you can always just drink some water to flush out some of these acids but your saliva has a job of buffering these acids so an average person produces about like three cups of saliva every single day and for my friend in germany dennis who still is trying to figure out what that converts into milliliters one cup which is actually less than this is about 750 milliliters or 25 ounces now that you have more awareness on what can affect the enamel on your teeth i think it understand now the benefits of apple cider vinegar and lemon water check this one out right here you	Success
The #1 Top Remedy for Dental Plaque (TARTAR)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ktNhvkmB00	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let for tarter now what is tartar tartar is Dental plaque what we about is something called biofilms okay and biofilms are a combination of these calcium houses that house bacteria it one of their survival mechanisms what they do is they hide underneath this calcium little Dome and that way they go undetected from your immune system as well as from antibiotics in fact 95% of bacteria in nature live in biofilms if you even take a look at a like a little rock in a little stream and if you actually pick that rock up you it slippery that all over the place it mechanism that very long time so anytime you have water as in saliva U you biofilms and if there abundance of biofilms you get bad breath you with inflammation receding gums and of course many people get to the point where it have to go to the dentist and have it extracted but what I want to talk about is if you are continually getting too much Tarter in your teeth um I to show you what to do to prevent it or manage it a lot better now a couple things I want to mention Xylitol the sugar alcohol as in the Xylitol gum and the Xylitol sweeteners have antibiofilm properties they help suppress adhesions to your teeth so if you gum make sure it natural things that are anti-biofilm okay natural herbs you have Rosemary you have clove thyme oregano oil garlic cumin which is in turmeric cinnamon and another compound called na a c all of those can help reduce biofilms however the remedy that I want to talk about really has just three simple ingredients okay and I tell you why you should use this the number one ingredient is baking soda now why baking soda baking soda is sodium bicarbonate okay so one thing about biofilms especially the ones that overgrow around your teeth as um tartar can start producing too many acids and when the PE H gets to the point where it 5.5 then the body starts leeching calcium out of your bones it decalcification and so it important to make sure your pH in your mouth does not get that acid you want it neutral or maybe slightly acid but not too much and the real main thing that U produces too much acid is what I talked about in another video it it much sugar or or you you that these bacteria love as well as the yeast because there yeast called Candida in biofilms as well and as they eat all this sugar they produce the byproduct of lactic acid and now the pH starts to decrease and the environment starts to become ideal for extracting calcium from the teeth so you course the microbes are using the calcium for housing so using baking soda sodium bicarbonate is a great way to increase the pH to make things a little bit more alkaline to help buffer that pH so the acid isn out calcium also baking soda can help to break down these biofilms and the other thing that sodium bicarbonate baking soda is that this is what your saliva makes to buffer these acids so you something that your body is already making so therefore it has virtually no side effects so you teaspoon in a half of a cup of water okay then you thing and that is called hydrogen peroxide now you get the 3% hydrogen peroxide and you can get from the drugstore but hydrogen peroxide is a really good um compound to help inhibit biofilms from developing as well as killing off bacteria yeast candida all these microbes and another very interesting thing about hydrogen peroxide is guess what your body makes it it saliva hydrogen peroxide is a major uh compound that your cells use to kill microbes so we your body what it naturally produces but it just in higher quantities so you use a four of a teaspoon of baking soda and a four of a teaspoon of hydrogen peroxide side 3% mix that in a half a cup of water and then use your toothbrush to brush your teeth after you brush your teeth with toothpaste what this will do it prevent the biofilms from continuing to come back and that way your teeth will be nice and smooth now one last thing there is some interesting research it a little bit mixed but there seems to be a positive correlation between vitamin K2 and inhibiting this Dental plaque so some people who actually start taking vitamin K2 that normally comes with vitamin D3 start to noticing that the inside of their teeth are becoming smoother and smoother so that little thing that you can you can try but in general vitamin K2 is all about transporting calcium into the bone and out of the soft tissues but anyway I wanted to give you a really good simple remedy to prevent tartar from building up in your teeth and I think another good video for you to watch is more information on vitamin K2 check it out I put it right here	Success
Use Your Saliva and Urine pH to Find Deeper Health Problems	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sRyflXdBrw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now you can tell a lot about the body by the ph of your saliva and your urine and you can get very inexpensively these little ph strips right here i don if you can see that right there oh back here okay there you go so basically what you do is on the front here you see you have the different phs and you just like strip that off and you put your mouth and then you can match your ph to whatever it should be okay same thing with the urine now what you need to know is this ph goes on a scale from 1 to 14. right in the middle is 7 that so anything above 7 is more alkaline than anything below seven is more acid and the other thing you need to know is that when you you phs and so when someone says oh yeah everyone needs to be more alkaline you have to ask them what part of your body you talking about the blood okay they talking about the stomach so each tissue in your body has a different ph and so the reason why i like measuring the urine in the saliva is that it easy you don you just need to get one of these which is only like six dollars or maybe 10 bucks and then you can check these things periodically to see what on the other point i want to bring up is that this only gives you one little indicator or clue about what body there information you that to see if you really have this thing so just because your saliva or urine is too acid or too alkaline doesn or a really accurate diagnosis but it can give you a clue of what inside all right so the first thing we ph okay so normally the ph of urine should be slightly acid it should be between 4.8 okay to 7.8 however i would say an average around five to six but it can go a little bit higher okay so what is urine urine is filtered blood okay and your kidneys do a great job of recycling everything it can it very very efficient so it take proteins it vitamins it minerals etc and and conserve them and pull them back in the body but if you can just see what the ph of your urine is you can get some pretty cool information about what so if your urine is too alkaline okay let a nine it could be because you drinking too much alkaline water some people have bought this machine to alkalize their water and i people with a urine ph of a nine by just drinking too much of this water so that could be because you test yourself right after you ate okay and that can also throw off the page so you don check yourself right after you ate it best to do it uh like two hours before you eat however if you up chances are your ph is going to be really really really acid so you really don catch the urine catch of the day so don check it like before a meal now if it too alkaline it could mean that you vegan and you pretty much eat a lot of alkaline foods being too alkaline could also mean that you have an infection okay a bacterial infection because this bacteria gives a byproduct of excessive ammonia which is very very alkaline but just realize that because you have an infection i the potential things that can contribute to excessive alkalinity now relationship to this condition called gout if the ph of your urine is too alkaline and you have gout you have an increased risk of releasing these uric acid crystals into your big toe so you reduce the crystals so you really can only have a gout attack if your urine ph is too alkaline all right next thing that can make your urine two alkaline is if you or if you are taking antacids or it could be that you just vomited that can make your ph change and when we talk about kidney stones for example kidney stones tend to develop when you have alkaline urine so if you keep your ph of your urine more acidic and you drink enough fluid it majorly decreases the risk of getting a kidney stone because when your fluids are too alkaline calcium doesn mobilize it tends to come out of solution and forms crystals i mean you may have seen this in your house if you have well water for example or hard water and you see these little calcium crystals depositing on your faucet that means that the water is alkaline and that calcium is coming out of the water and accumulating on your faucet now one more thing about having excessively alkaline urine that also exists when someone has kidney failure all right now let happens if your urine ph is too acid now remember i above the normal ph range of what uh urine should be so if it could mean that you too much meat okay it can also mean that you have uncontrolled diabetes and that you might actually develop a condition called ketoacidosis because ketones are acid now typically when you not going to see a major excessive acid in the urine but if you are on the ketogenic diet plus you doing fasting especially prolonged fasting you acidic urine and that usually is nothing to worry about that concerned and if you are concerned you can just consume a little bit of baking soda just a little bit just to help neutralize that but i wouldn concerned about that because you going to eventually eat and then the ph is going to come back to normal so fasting or even starvation can increase the acidity of your urine now you also see dehydration when you have an overly acidic urine situation and lastly if you check the first urine catch of the day you it being very very acid so i wouldn worry about that but i you know that it excessively acid if you check your urine because all night long you are fasting all right so now you have a little more awareness on how to evaluate the ph of your urine okay now let saliva now normally the saliva should be not as acidic as a urine it should be just slightly acidic or neutral okay so the normal range of saliva is between 6.2 okay and 7.6 now one purpose of saliva is to help flush out the carbohydrates in your mouth and the acids that contribute to feeding bacteria okay because the bacteria in your mouth love and live on sugar and other carbohydrates so the saliva that is constantly being produced is washing it out to limit the amount of food for your microbes it some of the acids that are a byproduct of bacteria because when the bacteria and yeast ferment sugar and carbohydrates they produce like lactic acid and other acids that can then cause decay so that other purpose is to help buffer the acids because in this lava you actually have alkalizers that help buffer the acid there saliva you have enzymes to help break down carbohydrates and i also will put another video down below talking a little bit more about saliva if you interested all right so if you take this right here and you check the ph of your saliva and it the ph is going too high that could mean you have too much bacteria in your mouth and when the ph is excessively alkaline in your mouth you are at risk for getting tartar and tartar is more of a advanced dental plaque situation it building up because you have number one bacteria and number two your ph is alkaline so remember when i talked about calcium um kind of coming out of solution when you here so you on your teeth you get calcium deposits in your kidney as kidney stones and you can get calcium deposits in your joints as arthritis or calcium deposits in your heart as plaquing so calcium deposits have a lot to do with ph and by the way if your blood is excessively alkaline uh you might have a tendency to get tetany that little twitching twitching or a muscle cramps whereas if your blood is too acid that is going to affect your energy level you also going to affect your breathing however i don blood ph because that is very very difficult to test all right so let back on topic and by the way the bacteria use this calcium to protect themselves against extremes in ph so if your urine is too alkaline that bacteria can still survive so bacteria doesn will live in a certain ph but it tries to survive by doing things to protect itself all right so the next thing that occurs with an excessively alkaline saliva is gingivitis so gingivitis is a mild form of periodontitis which is inflammation around your gums and so if you have tartar that your teeth that is just underneath the gums that but a mild form of inflammation in your gums it about if the ph of your mouth is too acidic what does that give us some information about well it could tell us that you eating way too much sugar because bacteria also can thrive when the ph of your mouth is too acidic and you so if you carbohydrates or you i don or you you drink sodas or you drink a lot of juice all that sugar is going to feed the bacteria and then the byproduct from that is going to be a lot of acids and then all that acid is then going to cause demineralization the calcium from your teeth is going to leech out and that is what we call a cavity so if you have kids for example you should be using this to check their ph and educate them about what that means you can just tell them like wow your ph is too acid because you bacteria in your mouth all this sugar and that a cavity so that might motivate them to stop eating sugar now if your ph is too acid you might have chronic halitosis because of the bacterial connection they produce excessive certain gases and you might have more of a severe infection in your gums that with excessive alkalinity and excessive acidity in your saliva you can have bacteria all right so now the big question what do you do to correct the extremes in phs whether something is too alkaline or too acid now there are a lot of videos i on maybe taking apple cider vinegar or eating certain things to bring the ph back but ultimately that the best thing you can do is just to focus on eating healthily okay and what does that mean well for that information i send you to another video but by eating correctly that is going to be your best bet to correct the different ph different places in your body versus doing other things to try to like patch up this problem so for what to eat this is the video that you need to watch next you	Success
#1 Early Sign of Toxic Kidneys	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik1AgqT_rms	Dr. Eric Berg DC	i sign of toxic kidneys all right so what do the kidneys actually do well they filter blood they are the main blood filtering organs of the body you have two of them and they filter roughly about 1700 liters of blood every single day and that through these filters the kidneys remove waste and a big part of this waste is the protein waste your body doesn consuming excess protein that your body doesn the kidneys as waste your kidneys actually get rid of excess minerals and chemicals and it recycles a lot of nutrients as well your kidneys control blood pressure they control your bone growth the production of your red blood cells so the kidney function goes way beyond just filtering blood now before i get into the early signs i want to touch on one very important point the most common reason for chronic kidney disease and that is called diabetic nephropathy now what do i mean nephropathy nephropathy is a disease of your nephrons and so the kidney is basically made up of tiny little filters and those are nephrons so a nephron is basically a little filter composed of tiny little capillaries and so you have all this blood running through these kidneys to little nephrons to the point where now we the common cause of this destruction is high sugar flowing through your blood sugar is very destructive to the capillaries the blood flow that supplies the nervous system to the brain and also your fingers and your toes and pretty much all the nerves so if we did a deep dive and looked through a very sophisticated microscope of what this sugar is caramelizing the tiny fibers of the blood vessels and we blood vessels and so we leaking blood so if we look at the kidney as kind of this vascular blood vessel organ the high levels of sugar create a leaking effect on the kidneys so you things like protein and so too much protein in the urine is an indicator of kidney disease but what happens when you lose protein you in your urine and then you start disrupting the normal fluids in the blood and you get edema so when the protein the blood goes down you start getting fluid that leaks out into the tissues okay as a dna so the number one early sign of kidney damage is decreased urine output because you in other places inside your body in your ankles and your legs and your feet around the eyes around the hands so instead of eliminating the urine it kind of backing up into the tissues and so when you urinate you see a large output of urine so that number one symptom but number two you frequent urination now frequent urination doesn amount of urine coming out when you urinate it just means that you urinating frequently smaller amounts on top of a lot of retention of fluid throughout the body so instead of that fluid coming out of you it backing up underneath the eyes on top of the eyes uh in the ankles when you press your finger into the ankle you that little dent it now some of you are saying wasn the symptom of liver disease well just think about this well anytime you have a kidney problem you have a liver problem so there you and a very very healthy kidney both the kidney and the liver work very closely together and so a lot of the symptoms can cross over so number one decreased urine output number two urinary frequency number three ammonia smelling urine body odor and breath now ammonia has a very distinct smell but that ammonia smell is basically just more waste because the kidneys are not able to do their job when the kidney loses its function in chronic kidney disease you filters called nephrons so just think about what happens to the toxicity in your body and so sometimes people think uh wow i blood maybe i need to eat more protein well that never helps all that to do it and create more stress on the kidneys number four your urine is foamy that is an excessive byproduct of protein it can also occur when you exercising intensely as well but if you have foaming urine and you didn exercise and you didn of protein then potentially it could be the kidney all right number five you time okay now one of the functions of the kidney is to help create red blood cells and if you able to create red blood cells you become anemic and you time number six itchy skin your skin can also be dry as well as itchy so those two symptoms are indicators that there could be a kidney problem and number seven which occurs with so many issues uh you to be tired all right so now that you know the number one sign of early kidney damage as well as some of the other signs as well what can you do about it now this is this amazes me when i chronic kidney disease okay they going to the doctor some of them are on kitty dialysis okay and they are given no instruction on what to eat what diet they should be on they eliminate the massive amount of carbohydrates that they know it one the most important thing especially through diabetic it down the carbs okay just cut them way down as low as possible and get your carbs from vegetables okay not from grains because if you look at chronic kidney disease one of the recommendations would be you know like whole grains cut back the red meat cut back your salt why would anyone want to add grains what benefits do grains have on the kidneys zero zero benefits and number two you need to give up alcohol completely um if you look at chronic kidney disease they want to eliminate it why because you already in a very fragile state and the kidney is damaged and just a little bit of alcohol is just going to push you further into the mud you at a place where you can afford to have even just a little bit your diet has to be very very clean if you want to recover and the third point i want to bring up is the amount of protein you don you just want to do a moderate amount of protein okay a high quality protein like eggs or fish or grass-fed you know meats things like that as compared to protein powders or some protein shake with soy protein isolates you don like i said get your carbs from your vegetables have a lot of vegetables moderate protein now i have some really good additional information on what to eat if your kidneys are not doing well i put that up right here check it out	Success
7 Home DIY Tests for Adrenal Fatigue and STRESS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvBi5A6iS9I	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today i simple home tests that you can do to determine if you may have adrenal fatigue now i medically they don fatigue you know they do recognize that there are adrenal dysfunction diseases like addison your body any more adrenal hormones on the flip side you have cushing you it cortisol situation but my question is why can different problems in between you don just wake up one day with addison disease or cushing they start at a certain point and gradually get worse but medically they don in between conditions or shall we say subclinical versions of these problems and i think probably one of the reasons it because it doesn test so since the adrenal glands are intimately involved with the autonomic nervous system i several tests you can do at home to kind of get a clue on what your autonomic nervous system i talking about the sympathetic nervous system which is the flight of fight and then the parasympathetic nervous system which is rest and digest and so first let adrenal fatigue okay you have insomnia that you stand up too fast okay you have brain fog you have low tolerance to stress you cannot tolerate stress as well as you used to you might have low libido you may have allergies or asthma your immune system is poor you may get sick easily because your resistance is on the low side you may have inflammation because when you run out of the adrenal function you lose that those powerful anti-inflammatories and then you end up with inflammatory conditions so anything that says itis is an inflammatory condition and you may have poor focus because with the adrenals you all over the place you problems 24 7 and so it to put your attention on one thing over a period of time without shifting to another topic so that relates to completing things you might start a lot of things but you just don because you get distracted now the adrenals are two little glands sitting on top of the kidney deep inside your abdomen and they respond to stress they help your body respond to stress states so they adapt all these different body functions to a stress situation now the problem nowadays is that a lot of people are under a chronic stress they necessarily being chased by a tiger but they are feeling like they chased by a tiger 24 7 because they have mental stress and the challenge is if you have all this mental stress without the physical way of releasing the stress you you the stress can build up and it can affect your sleep it can affect a lot of different things so let seven home tests okay the first one is called raglans very simple test you need a blood pressure cuff and you need a piece of paper and a pen okay what you to take your blood pressure lying down while you record that and then you stand up right away and recheck your blood pressure now normally the top number called the systolic should go up by 6 to 10 points but with adrenal fatigue it go down or it and i you stand up you should normally have this certain amount of adaptation and so if there mechanism like adrenals are weak your blood pressure might crash down like i know 10 points 20 points i stand up when your blood pressure drops that much that is a major adrenal issue so you can kind of get an indication of how bad your adrenals are by what happens to your blood pressure so that is the iris test another name for that if you wanted to know is called this paradoxical pupillary response test so you autonomic nervous system control as far as the muscles that allow light in the eye now if you ever look at the eye when you go from a dark room to maybe a bright light your body light going into the eye if you in the sun and you your pupil is going to constrict okay so it going to lessen the amount of light into the eye so you your eyes used to the dark okay for maybe i don okay and you mirror so you don light directly in the eye shine it slightly to the side and when you shine the light into the eye you occurs with the eye that you lighting to normally when you shine light into the eye it should constrict and the constricted pupil the little black little hole in the center should maintain that constriction for at least 30 seconds okay but if the adrenal glands are weak because you have the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic playing tug of war on your eyes then you not going to be able to maintain that constriction you can see a couple things you might see that the eye kind of goes up up and down like back and forth okay i you might see that it it starts to vasodilate get bigger so if it constricted state while you the light okay into the eye then there could be some adrenal weakness involved all right test number three is pretty simple this one you hold your breath okay you completely hold your breath you can put your your um your fingers over your nose and you can just hold your breath normally if the adrenal glands are are good you should be able to hold your breath for at least 40 seconds but the worse your adrenals are the less you can hold your breath you may find that you 10 seconds or 15 seconds or 20 seconds and you that could indicate that the adrenal glands are weak because if your body in a stress state um you just cannot hold on to uh air that long test number four basically you observe how you recover after exercise okay because adrenal fatigue cases don recover after exercise too well now you can check your pulse rate before during and after the exercise and if the adrenal glands are weak the pulse rate just will not come down it kind of stays higher for a longer period of time or you can just subjectively um sense how you feel after you work out normally if the adrenal glands are good you but if your adrenal glands are weak it recover you exercise it might take days before you recover so your recovery has a lot to do with your adrenal function let five your ability to tolerate stress and you are the best person to judge for that the question is can you tolerate stress can you be there comfortably without being irritable or flying off the handle okay or breaking down if you can tolerate stress that well chances are your adrenals are not coping all right number six your ability to handle inclines like climbing up a hill going upstairs uh any any type of exercise where you doing inclines is going to be pretty bad if your adrenal glands are fatigued because simply you adrenal in fact you may find just by standing up you get dizzy or you faint so that lastly number seven a really good test to determine what adrenals is just how long you sleep you get up in the middle of the night specifically around two o we know cortisol could be involved or can you go to sleep maintain a comfortable sleep and wake up feeling refreshed that indication to tell you if you have healthy adrenals or not now the best next video for you to watch is what to eat if you have adrenal fatigue and i put that up right here check it out you	Success
Best Home Test for a CALCIUM DEFICIENCY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU7taCx-bQE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	i home test that you can do to determine if you have a calcium deficiency now calcium deficiencies are pretty common but usually not because the person is not taking a supplement or not getting it from their diet it absorbing it or the body is not utilizing it properly so in this video we of the calcium deficiency and all of the other reasons why you might be deficient and then a real simple home test that you can do okay so what are the symptoms well number one anxiety irritability insomnia muscle tension spasms or cramps low back pain constipation high blood pressure heart palpitations frequent nose bleeds could be a calcium deficiency soft fingernails could be another indicator frequent cold sores sunburns when you barely go in the sun then we have hives having frequent fevers could be related to a calcium deficiency because calcium lowers your immune system i remember with our kids every time they had a fever i them a little calcium and it would go right away frequent hoarseness chronic coughing and difficulty getting to sleep so calcium is a mineral that we need for our muscles our bones our tendons our ligaments and the nervous system calcium also acts as a communication between your nerves and there affect the calcium absorption okay first thing is vitamin d if you don have enough vitamin d you well if you have sufficient vitamin d you can increase the absorption of calcium by a factor of 20x okay that is a major increase in calcium absorption and of course so many people are deficient in vitamin d now magnesium if you have a difficult time absorbing calcium because magnesium and calcium work together another factor is the hydrochloric acid in your stomach if you don a lot of people over the age of 40 and 50 and 60 because as you age you have less and less hydrochloric acid in your stomach and you need acid to be able to absorb certain minerals especially calcium low essential fatty acids like omega-3 fatty acids essential fatty acids help you absorb calcium and so if you omega-3 fatty acids you difficult time absorbing calcium all right next thing is low estrogen let and you don that can affect your calcium another factor is your ph if you about your blood and normally blood should be alkaline but if you you absorbing calcium as well so you may deposit calcium in the eyes there cataracts and the teeth is tartar the kidney is kidney stones in the joints there spurring so unless the ph is correct it absorb calcium if you have gut inflammation you more difficult time absorbing calcium so all of these conditions where you have you know irritable bowel syndrome or diverticulitis or crohn affect your absorption of certain minerals especially in calcium and the next thing is interesting hypothyroidism you need a normal thyroid to be able to help you absorb calcium so if your thyroid is low like let be a reason why you not to mention the hormone that the thyroid produces called calcitonin if calcitonin is low you may also have a deficiency in calcium so as you can see there way beyond the dietary aspects of calcium but let talk about how to determine if you are deficient in calcium so what you do is you take this blood pressure cuff just a standard blood pressure cuff and you going to wrap it around one of your calves you you feeling a cramp and if that number is 200 or less suspect a calcium deficiency and of course if you have peripheral vascular disease i don doing this test now there could be other reasons but this is a pretty good indicator if you now if the pressure is between 200 to 220 you have sufficient calcium and if you you have the optimum amount of calcium but you don the units you millimeters of mercury and what happens when you have a lot of muscle cramps at rest okay especially when you test just magnifies that problem a little bit more so you can determine where your weakness is so in the description i put these numbers down below and describe this in detail so you can actually refer back to it now if you have a calcium deficiency before you start taking calcium you really want to make sure that you because it could be a lot of other factors so really quickly i want to give you some additional information so let talk about hydrochloric acid how do you know if you well you get indigestion if you do then that could be the reason why you can case you need to take something like retain hydrochloride or more apple cider vinegar now with magnesium it more difficult i mean you can go get an intracellular test which is more involved but i just have a question for you do you consume a good amount of leafy greens that would be a good indicator that you have enough magnesium if you don consume vegetables chances are you could be deficient in magnesium in which case that increase the absorption of calcium and by the way you from leafy greens now what about essential fatty acids well you consume a lot of fish do you have inflammation do you have arthritis okay if you answered yes to any of these maybe you need a good omega-3 fatty acid or better yet start consuming more salmon or sardines cod liver oil okay things that are high in omega-3 fatty acids the reason i like olive oil because it not only has the omega-3 but it also has the vitamin d at the same time as well as vitamin a now what about alkalinity how do we know u2 alkaline i check it out but one uh common symptom of being too alkaline and i about your blood is that you get this little twitch on your skin it could be underneath the left eye could be anywhere on your body a little it called tetany a little twitch that could be a factor in which case you need to start drinking maybe some outside of vinegar on a regular basis uh the change of chloride because once you start to put the acids back in that can help reset things but here corrected you just need to eat healthy and your ph will come back in the balance now what about low estrogen okay well let this could be the reason what can you do about it there few things i you are menopausal to get a little bit more information on that topic now what about low vitamin d well do you have a low immune system are you depressed do you have low back pain these are all indicators of low vitamin d is it the middle of winter do you normally take vitamin d or not do you get enough sun so in other words you need to start looking at the other reasons why you might be deficient and see which root cause makes the most sense now if you haven video on calcium i think that video would be the most appropriate check it out i put it up right here	Success
The FASTEST Way to Get Rid of Your Allergies	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB2UQQlI00g	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let to allergies okay now whether you have allergies or food sensitivities let get rid of those but what is the difference between a true allergy and a food sensitivity well there things that are uh different with each one a true allergy involves a protein but with a food sensitivity many times there is a delayed reaction okay so you eat this certain thing and you don about two to six hours later sometimes even up to 72 hours later and this makes it very very difficult to connect the dots because it can show up in a headache it can show up in a mood change like depression it can show up in fatigue it can show up as crohn your gut it can show up in your skin as eczema or it can show up in your joints as arthritis but if you wanted to figure out what food sensitivities you have you can get what which basically it antibody test but with food sensitivities there more of a generalized discomfort usually not a severe symptom but with food allergies there inflammatory symptom or even a very uh life-threatening situation where you have an anaphylactic shock so the question is how do you deal with these is there a non-drug safe antidote or remedy for allergies or food sensitivities now there definitely is a very valid uh form of uh therapy is just the elimination diet right you figure out what you are sensitive to and then you avoid that for a period of time and then sometimes it can even go away but there than that i want to touch on now you have to realize that allergies originate in your gut something happens with the permeability in your gut so you start to get a leaky gut which is just the tight junctions in your gut start to open up and then some of these particles whether it protein or other particles can get through that little barrier and then your immune system can react to it and then you start developing antibodies to this specific particle or food and it gets really confusing because let the protein in peanuts is very similar to almonds so you may have a true almond allergy that can also show up as a peanut allergy so i in that complexity now because what i going to talk about is how just to improve your immune system to the point where you don so the antidote to allergies is called autophagy it body is eliminating proteins that you don somewhat damaged it is a survival mechanism that your body has been using for a very very long time to help protect you against various things because if there some type of defect or impairment with this normal autophagy condition and then these proteins can exist and create a lot of problems for people there a direct link between impairments in autophagy and alzheimer parkinson lung fibrosis and a whole list of other problems so this is a very important normal process that goes on in our body it a lot of damaged things like even damage within your dna or damage within the mitochondria which can create a lot of problems and even increase your risk for cancer and autophagy is also an anti-aging process because as you age autophagy can come in there and help clean up some of the old damaged proteins that need to be removed giving you not just a useful look but better functioning body and autophagy can even decrease infections it can remove um long-standing viruses from your body like epstein-barr virus human papilloma virus and other pathogens that shouldn your body so autophagy is a really good thing but as far as allergies go there a lot of great data on this which i going to put the links down below that you can increase the expression of autophagy to help decrease allergies so the research i shows that you can decrease allergies sensitivities histamine levels levels of igg which are basically the antibodies that are involved in sensitivities autophagy can repair the immune system it can rebuild your immune system it can enhance the immune defense system and it can reduce pulmonary inflammation so now the big question is how do we increase autophagy in the body and there most powerful one is fasting okay fasting is the most powerful stimulus of a topogene now what i would recommend if you have allergies is i would start doing intermittent fasting immediately and do that on a regular basis okay that alone just might eliminate your allergies especially as you increase your fasting window okay to like 18 hours or maybe 20 hours or even getting on one meal a day but there do that will take you to the next level and that would be to do periodic prolonged fasting okay so let say every month or every two weeks you do a 48 hour fast for every month you do a 72 hour fast you any problem with your immune system to the fact where that alone might handle your allergies but you over time your allergies will be less and less and less and less and the cool thing about fasting is it will drop inflammation so even if you have allergies you lot less inflammation and not to mention that about 70 to 80 percent of your immune system is located in your gut and fasting does wonders for your gut because you don gut a chance to heal as well as improve the diversity and the strength of the microbiome i don your microbiome the friendly bacteria in your gut greatly help modulate or control your immune system so anything you can do to improve the microbes is going to help you reduce allergies in fact babies who experience the c-section are at much greater risk of getting allergies than that children that have the normal birthing process because they weren that the mother would normally give a child and the next thing is regular or consistent exercise can greatly improve autophagy green tea can help stimulate autophagy and turmeric and other similar herbs can also stimulate and boost autophagy all right so now there are other things that can also lessen allergies that i would recommend adding to fasting okay probiotics taking probiotics on a regular basis since 80 of your immune system is your microbiome taking probiotics can greatly greatly reduce allergies i would recommend taking your probiotics right before bed okay the third thing is vitamin d treat what vitamin d is that it helps to suppress uh immune reactions without suppressing the immune system that vitamin d in something like uh the cytokine storm where there uncontrollable inflammatory reaction or hypersensitivity so vitamin d is really really important and i would take um no less than 10 000 iu or more probably 20 000 ius or even 30 000 i use depending on the severity of the allergy there which i shows that the development of an allergy occurs when someone has a zinc deficiency so taking zinc would be a very logical thing to do now the question is how do i do fasting okay is there a good way well i just happen to have a video on that check it out i put it right here	Success
The #1 Remedy for Gout Attacks (WORKS FAST) - Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwDpBTxSYKM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now of all the medical conditions gout seems to be a very mysterious condition you know the theory of um we type foods and the uric acid that is broken down from purines is developing crystals that deposit in your big toe yet so many people that go on a low purine diet don and then people that get on medications just don that these medications create so today i remedy for gout using a different strategy but first i wanted to mention some very interesting things about god that you should know about most of the uric acid that is in your body the great majority of it is coming from an endogenous source whereas an endogenous mean it means that your body is making this uric acid only a small amount of uric acid comes externally from your diet and 50 of the people that experience gout attacks have normal uric acid and the crystals that are forming from these uric acid crystals are not even in the exact location where someone is experiencing or feeling the gout attack and of course the other point is about genetics you know if they can it but that also has some holes there is a genetic tendency for gout but mainly in australia i think one out of 20 people in australia get gout due to their genes but out of all the people that have a genetic propensity to have gout only 10 of those people actually have gout attacks so there just so much confusion in this area it ridiculous and so apparently in a gout attack um the pain is not necessarily coming from the crystals that are digging into your tissues it there that acid crystals that so how do we do with gut attacks well i have found that when people go off carbohydrates sugars especially fructose high fructose corn syrup alcohol especially beer just that change alone handles a lot of problems with gout but there are still people that do that and they still have gut attacks so what can be done well we do know this one fact about gout in order for uric acid crystals to form okay so your immune system can react to it your ph has to be more on the acidic side we know that so based on that data if you were to alkalize the body just a little bit and i alkalization therapy that can give you some immediate relief so if we combine that with the ketogenic diet which is low carb as well as intermittent fasting i think you is the best remedy to alkalize the urine sodium bicarbonate would be the primary thing that would give you the least amount of side effects and i before i tell you how to take it some people are sodium sensitive they because of high blood pressure whatever if that i would recommend using potassium citrate instead however baking soda will work a little bit better and of course baking soda and water doesn taste that good so if i were going to take it i would recommend adding some potassium citrate now if you wanted a really good potassium citrate of course i recommend my own electrolyte powder because it a good amount of potassium citrate so you would add one scoop of that with the baking soda but you don to do that you can just use baking soda alone now as far as the amount of baking soda i would recommend starting out with a smaller amount like 1 8 of a teaspoon in a glass of water about 8 ounces okay and i would do that for a couple days and then i would increase that to a fourth of a teaspoon of baking soda then i would increase that to a half a teaspoon of baking soda and depending on the severity of this gout attack you may want to try this once twice or three times a day on an empty stomach spaced out about an hour okay so you would take it wait an hour take another dose wait another hour take another dose that should pretty much put your gout attack in remission now you don meals because it dilute your hydrochloric acid so taking an empty stomach at least an hour before you eat this is also a good remedy if you have uric acid kidney stones okay that oxalate stones but with other types of stones you the urine so there how far you go before you far because you don on the alkaline side and you don to go too far on the acidic side so i going to put a link down below for information to determine if you too alkaline okay and then you would back off if that was the case now another bit of research i want to touch on is using transdermal sodium bicarbonate so apparently um there was a study done that took sodium bicarbonate and put it into a patch okay where you can put it topically where it can absorb right into the big toe and this would avoid taking it internally due to the high amounts of sodium yet i couldn can find this transdermal baking soda so i have nothing to put in the link on that however this may work i don test it but to dissolve baking soda in some water and then soaking your toe in it and there research that baking soda can increase your immune system primarily your macrophages which actually can help reduce inflammation as well as baking soda increasing your t cell so apparently it does affect the immune system as well and that what gout is it is why a lot of people use it for autoimmune conditions because it can tone down the inflammation now the other thing you need to know about gout is that there of gout in people with metabolic syndrome this means that they carbs so usually when someone know the organ meats or the red meats and things like that they consuming beer or carbohydrates so i really do not believe it that are causing this gout attack at all in fact a lot of people when they go carnivore get rid of their gout but for those people on the ketogenic diet from interviewing a lot of people that are trying to get rid of their gown they they a little bit of the wrong carbohydrates they diet standardly like i recommend it they sort of doing a ketogenic diet so when they get on a very strict ketogenic diet they tend to do much much better but there avoid if you have gout okay number one of course the obvious sugar in all forms of sugar which also includes maltodextrin which i just did a video on the second thing is all the refined grains and refined carbohydrates okay and then also when we sugars there increase the risk of getting out and that would be xylitol so if you do have gout you type of sugar alcohol like erythritol something like that but just realize if you fruit many times they add in maltodextrin which is a very bad corn sugar that i would recommend avoiding especially if you have gout now of course alcohol and especially beer can increase your risk of getting out and even medications like aspirin like diuretics can increase the risk of gout the worst sugar for gout would be fructose and even certain vitamins like niacin can trigger gout attacks so niacin is really good for helping someone with cholesterol problems i mean it scientifically proven to do that but if you have gout taking another form of b3 would be much better and that would be niacinamide okay that version of niacin that doesn the flush so niacinamide will help you with gout and arthritis but not necessarily cholesterol but if you don better off taking niacin now that you have that information i want to share a related video that i think you very interesting on sodium i put it right here check it out you	Success
How to Shrink Your Prostate Naturally: The #1 Nutrient You Need	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72j8NXuJ1oY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	well today i have a very interesting video on the prostate and the most important nutrient to maintain prostate health now this topic was inspired by my new favorite book called soil grass and cancer okay this is a book that i found uh it was very expensive it 250 dollars i couldn but it information that each chapter is very very different so the last chapter was on insulin which i did a video on that and then this one was on the relationship between zinc and the prostate gland there great data i want to share with you i think the first thing to talk about is this big confusion of what the prostate gland is very few people know what the prostate gland does all they know is that as you get older and enlarges and then it affects your urination 50 of men over the age of 60 start to get an enlargement of the prostate gland so what we do know is as you age the prostate gets larger and that can affect urination stream flow libido retention of urine and your bladder backup of urine in the kidney and so i think it understand a little bit about the prostate in identifying why this occurs i mean it age a high high percentage of them start developing prostate problems and then as it gets bigger you getting prostate cancer but just because the prostate enlarges doesn that where the prostate is located there of your pelvis called the symphysis pubis and the prostate is right behind that bone okay and then the prostate also is just underneath the bladder and there from the bladder that this prostate wraps around and the size of the prostate would be about equivalent to a walnut size so it quite big and then you have the rectum which is right behind that so that where it the prostate is about 70 gland and 30 muscle so it does two things it helps you secrete a certain fluid which i going to talk about and it also acts as a pump during ejaculation so it helps push this fluid through the tube which is the same tube is where your urine goes through and then out of the body now sperm is created in the testicles okay and it takes roughly about 60 to 70 days for sperm to develop so the sperm travels through this little tube up into the area of the prostate where you have additional glands that produce fluid with the fluids of the prostate gland all mixing together into what semen and so the purpose of semen is to fertilize sperm and sperm is basically just the genetics from a male body which is then going to join with the genetics of the ovary to form a human body so to do that you need something to feed the sperm which is fructose from the semen you need certain enzymes to help penetrate into the uterus lining because there factors to keep this sperm fertile and the sperm outside the body can last roughly about five days so on the other end in the female you have this egg which is inactive and it becomes active once the sperm penetrates so that summary of what the prostate does in relationship to these other factors now what gland in relationship to nutrition is that it is the gland that has the highest concentration of zinc so the prostate has a hundred times more concentration of zinc than your blood because if you test your blood and it not tell you what prostate gland so in this book i want to mention a couple little points he between a zinc deficiency and what happens with the prostate gland it actually enlarges there is a study done and i will put some links down below that shows a normal prostate okay and the level of zinc that like 744 micrograms and then you have a mild hypertrophy or enlarged prostate gland that had a lesser amount of zinc which is 486 micrograms then they tested people with chronic prostatitis and that was at 470 micrograms now remember this is all compared to a normal prostate gland which has 744 micrograms and then he talks about prostate and the cancer related to zinc apparently that level was actually on average 273 micrograms of zinc so we have this relationship between a zinc deficiency and inflammation in the prostate gland enlargement of the prostate gland and susceptibility to getting prostate cancer very very interesting the other point i want to bring up about this is that you have a very powerful form of testosterone okay called dht so testosterone can convert to dht with a certain enzyme okay and that called 5-alpha reductase and so there are certain medications that inhibit that enzyme to help reduce dht four now pattern baldness prostate hypertrophy erectile dysfunction because too much of that hormone dht can create bad effects but what that is zinc is a natural inhibitor of that enzyme fascinating and we also know that people with low testosterone are usually zinc deficient so zinc is the most important trace mineral to make sure your testosterone is high make sure that the fertility of sperm is there and to make sure that the size of the prostate is maintained now it going to get more interesting why would someone be deficient in zinc that to go through the reasons they don think about this what is the big push now with especially men as they get over the age of 50. don well they never differentiate the quality of red meat okay they lump red meat into one group they don differentiate between processed meats and grass-fed organic they just lump it into one big concept and tell you to get off red meat and they tell you to lower your cholesterol foods which happen to be the building block of testosterone and then what do they tell you to eat eat plant-based make sure you grains which is loaded with phytic acid probably the biggest thing that blocks your ability to absorb zinc in fact two billion people on this planet are deficient in zinc probably because they cereal and too many grains okay now the other interesting thing about aging is that when you age you lose the concentration of stomach acids and we need stomach acid to be able to absorb this zinc if you have low stomach acids you going to absorb zinc not to mention if you antacid you zinc if you that medication will deplete you of zinc if you you deficiencies alcohol is another common thing that will cause a zinc deficiency consuming a lot of sugar will cause a zinc deficiency eating frequent meals like in snacking lid at night while you tv creates insulin resistance which can also deplete zinc and so i here if you that testosterone sperm count the size of your prostate and eventually your urine flow one of the best sources of zinc is shellfish as in oysters but the second best source is red meat and to be totally transparent i do have a zinc product it product but i now taking zinc is not going to guarantee any type of cure for enlarged prostate lower testosterone reducing your risk of prostate cancer or anything related to any medical condition because there are a lot of other factors involved your diet how much alcohol you drink how much stress you go through and a lot of other factors related to your medications etc etc all right so now that you know a little bit more about the relationship between zinc and your prostate i wanted you to watch this next video on zinc which is quite interesting check it out you	Success

How to Increase Your Height and Grow Taller	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF8FhfgGe2w	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let height is it possible yes it sure is in practice over the years i handful of patients who had kids that really were not developing and that certain children in the family were taller but another child really was not growing like they should and so they wanted my advice so i gonna tell you what i recommended because it was successful now normally between age one and puberty you should grow roughly about two inches a year and then when you reach puberty it should be about four inches a year and then you pretty much stop growing between the ages of 18 and 20. and that stop growing a little bit before that and yet others continue to grow a little bit longer than that but that the age group that you stop growing so if you that age or less and you want to grow a little bit more what i and of course there limitation however if you are deficient in certain nutrients that can significantly affect your height so the three hormones that are involved in growth our number one human growth hormone okay and that is produced by the pituitary gland and it works through the liver the next hormone is igf-1 that insulin-like growth factor number one and that hormone is made by your liver and it the growth hormone and then we have a thyroid if the thyroid is not producing enough hormones that can create a stunted growth so let could create a growth hormone deficiency well the number one nutrient that can affect growth hormone is zinc so children with stunted growth are mainly deficient in zinc and people with a growth hormone deficiency are usually deficient in zinc so zinc is a very important trace mineral needed for more chemical reactions than all the other trace minerals combined and a couple things that will create a zinc deficiency consuming too many foods with phytates and phytates are in all the grains so all those so-called healthy whole grains that they tell you to eat can create a major zinc deficiency and then of course you have other things that will deplete zinc sugar refined carbohydrates alcohol caffeine stress not consuming enough foods or zinc like let or shellfish or let all those things can create a zinc deficiency the other thing that can create a growth hormone deficiency is starvation now i with all of your nutrients i about starvation where you your body of all the vitamins minerals nutrients amino acids essential fatty acids that type of thing now personally i think i stunted my growth because i my dad seven i think he could be six eight my mom is six foot no she am only six two and i think what i did to stop my growth was i wrestled in 9th grade 10th grade 11th grade 12th grade and then starting in college before i fractured my neck and you talk about having to cut weight and starve yourself through the season that was me so remember one time i had a wrestling match and i had to cut weight and i was way over so within three days i dropped a tremendous amount of weight and to do that i wore these plastic bags and i exercised pretty much all day and i sweat and i barely drank hardly any water i think i ate a few celery sticks and a couple french fries from mcdonald were not the healthiest thing on the planet but i was weak i was tired i was pushing myself and of course i made weight and then i just totally pegged out again and that went on for some years so all that starving and exercise and stress and lack of nutrients probably had a significant negative effect on my overall health so as far as growth hormone deficiencies you need zinc okay you also need enough protein you need sufficient protein so those people who do not consume enough protein can inhibit growth hormone and then number three this is very important sleep apparently growth hormone works when you sleeping that well if you have sleep problems and you could be the thing that can set your growth next thing on the list is obesity the more fat that you have on your body the less growth hormone that be activated and then you have other factors like smoking or second-hand smoking that can inhibit growth hormone and also caffeine i mean think about how many teenagers that are consuming massive amounts of caffeine and sugar which will deplete your zinc now out of all the age groups it teenager group that consumes the most ultra processed junk foods so talk about nutritional deficiencies now there nutrient that can create a deficiency in growth hormone and that is a lack of vitamin d now that thing nowadays with kids because they don pretty much sitting behind the computer the great majority of the day now as far as the other two hormones we have insulin growth factor if there let fatty because you eat a lot of carbohydrates or high fructose corn syrup that can inhibit that hormone igf number one and affect your growth now when we get to the thyroid gland thyroid gland is very sensitive to an iodine deficiency so with an infant or a small child or a teenager that does not have sufficient iodine that can greatly stun your growth iodine is mainly in seafood shellfish uh see kelp and it are grown close to the seashore but if that food is grown inland chances are it you or you wants to maximize their height these are the things that you want to put on the list number one a good trace mineral product that has zinc in it okay because you never want to just take zinc alone you want to take it in a blend of all the trace minerals number two this is the product that i would search out and find and recommend it pmg it called standard process you can look it up and i but it support the pituitary gland that makes growth hormone and i personally recommended it and saw the difference in height of certain kids that took it you just want to take one before bed for about three months the next thing on the list is to get a lot of sleep if you not sleeping that is a factor you need to address i below of what to do if you have insomnia and this is a really common reason why people are zinc deficient too many phytates in the diet phytates are in grains so you need to avoid grains and that way you don things in your diet that are actually blocking zinc and then the next vitamin of course is vitamin d ideally the best way to get vitamin d is through the sun okay get your kids out in the sun several hours a day that would be very very smart if they can them a vitamin d supplement all these things are going to maximize your height potential but you also must focus on your diet and i think the best way to figure out the healthiest diet you should be on is take a look at what everyone recommending especially the food pyramid okay look what the government is recommending and then use that as a check sheet to do the opposite okay the majority of your diet either whole grains or starchy carbohydrates in the form of potato whole grain rice things like that those are the foods that you absolutely want to emit from your diet they to avoid saturated fats and consume more vegetable oils now you want to consume saturated fats and you want to avoid vegetable oils because you can do that safely because your carbohydrates will be very low because you sugars now when they recommend consuming fruits and vegetables they allowing you to consume canned fruit and even fruit juice as your fruit and vegetables so i don fruit juice is pasteurized and it so concentrated with sugar it benefiting you in any way at all now of course i avoid red meat well where do you think you get zinc red meat is one of the best sources of zinc so in summary the best diet would be the healthy ketogenic diet now if you height should you do fasting well i think you should do intermittent fasting because one of the potent stimulators of growth hormone is fasting but just to make sure you get all your nutrients let fasting that you you avoid snacks and you have three meals or even two meals but these meals are really nutrient dense i think that can help you so anyway try some of the things i recommended and then come back and type in your comments down below so we can hear your success story i think the best next video for you to watch would be on zinc check it out i put it right here	Success
The #1 Nutrient to Boost Your Collagen (NOT VITAMIN C)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYB9CGGSwFM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I would like to discuss the number one nutrient in boosting your collagen now it definitely helps collagen but it something else now what is collagen collagen is that protein that connects everything together out of all the protein your body about 35% of it is collagen so it makes up your cartilage your muscles your tendons your ligaments your eyes the fascia the stuff that holds all your muscles together it right on top of your muscles it makes up your bone even your teeth and it around your skin and I think a lot of people are trying to boost their collagen by consuming collagen when in fact they this talk is inspired by this book that I the link between human and animal health and the mineral balance in the soil it a fascinating book on nutrition talking about the Rel ship between the animals that we eat and the animals that eat the grass that comes from certain soils so if there soil it plant which the animals eat and then we eat the animals so we deficient as well and the number one nutrient that boosts collagen is copper so copper has a direct effect on making collagen preventing the loss of collagen making elastin which is a U A protein that uh supports the structural Integrity of collagen and so this Trace mineral needed in a very small amount is necessary um in the enzymes that allow proteins to form and so the copper enzymes are all about structural Integrity so if you are deficient in Copper there are several things that can happen with your body tissue number one it can lead to something called swayback or lordosis now this happens in animals as well like but it also happens in humans where you have this excess lower back curve and that occurs because you don structural stability to hold everything together so things are becoming a little bit too loose now it can also show up in your skin as loose skin and as a side note copper has a lot of additional benefits including being able to tolerate the sun longer now what about hernas well there link down below that shows that relationship between people having hernas with a significant deficiency in Copper and that goes for all different types of hernas whether they or Hiatal because you need the structural Integrity that copper gives to hold everything together real nicely copper supports your joints so if your joints are weak or they chances are there could be a copper deficiency and also with muscles if your muscles are weak you may be deficient in Copper athletes that have sufficient copper have more endurance they hydrated they can go longer without drinking water so just think about exercised in the involvement of collagen and connective tissue I mean you talking about joints muscles everything your lower back discs need copper to make them very very strong your blood vessels need copper to prevent things like varicose veins so those are all the things that connect copper to collagen but let of copper if you have an iron deficiency anemia situation and you don enough copper and you take iron you not going to be able to fix your anemia copper is really necessary with your um your immune system your white blood cells as well as the size and shape of your red blood cells if you in Copper you can have a disorder where you is also involved with melanin which gives you that pigment so if you divici in Copper you can gray prematurely copper also uh supports the brain and it can help you keep your balance in the dark or when your eyes are closed so if you close your eyes and you feel dizzy or disoriented that could be a copper deficiency so let example you and you take off your shirt that momentary lack of light can affect your equilibrium and your balance having enough copper can also keep your uric acid in check copper is necessary to detoxify fluoride and by the way the more fluoride you have in your body the less copper you copper has been known to help warm up feet and that could be because it helps you transport iron which is necessary in hemoglobin all right so now what are the foods that are high in Copper liver kidney oysters shellfish shitake mushrooms and sesame seeds now what are the common causes of a copper deficiency well probably the biggest cause is that we just don soils which then translate to a copper deficiency in the foods that we eat you deficiency after gastric bass surgery you can also get a deficiency if you take too much ascorbic acid okay which is part of the vitamin C complex normally uh copper is supposed to be part of the vitamin C complex as an enzyme but if you of ascorbic acid out of the normal complex that can create a deficiency of copper too now another common cause of a copper deficiency is by someone taking too much zinc and so recently A lot of people have been on the bandwagon to take a lot of zinc and they probably been taking zinc out of the the complex of a lot of trace minerals including copper and taking too much zinc over a period of time can throw off your copper ratios having you be deficient in Copper so too much zinc can lower copper too much copper can lower zinc both zinc and copper work together and this is why I always recommend that you get your trace minerals in a complex too much sugar especially fructose can create a copper deficiency alcohol can create a deficiency as well as consuming too much fiber now I the fiber from your Foods um that come with these trace minerals I about all these new functional fibers that people are adding in the so-called ketofriendly bars or different foods now since we on the topic of collagen and probably a lot of people are interested in anti-aging I think the next video for

How to Fix Bunions in 3 Steps	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9kdv-1Mias	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let them and how to get rid of them now the technical name for a bunion is hallux valgus it becomes a problem in the big toe where the toe starts to malform in three different directions it tends to bend towards the other toes rotate and then elevate now the big problem with this is that it can become inflamed tender and it really affects your gait your ability to walk your ability to exercise and so you weight on other parts of your foot and ankle and then this throws off the symmetry of your muscles and now you might end up with knee pain or hip pain because of the compensation so what are the causes of this problem well there three main causes one is that your shoes that you wear are not uh fitting your feet correctly maybe the toe is too pointed maybe the shoe is too narrow and this is causing your big toe to go inward unfortunately these fashion shoes today are not designed to keep your toes nice and open and straight so the first thing you need to look at is your shoes um the best thing to do when you a shoe is to take the bottom of the shoe and then match your foot to see if there if there isn find some shoes that actually can really give your toes some space now that necessarily going to correct this problem but it can definitely prevent the problem now number two um having flat feet like myself can create a problem with big toe because there constantly shifting the weight forward to the toes especially the big toe and then that can affect the dynamics of how you step and then the foot flares out and now we have a lot of pressure on that toe and so now the toe starts going outward this way and number three just simply having ankle mobility issues that could come from an old injury to uh your ankle or your foot which then it caused compensation or it can be from having an aroma on your foot or a heel spur or any number of reasons including over training maybe as a child with some type of exercise so the solution is going to be involving putting flexibility back into the ankle which is a lot of the calf muscles that we so let number one if you have shoes that are not fitting correctly you need you need to get some shoes that do fit your toes and this also includes getting socks that are not too tight around the toes they have socks now that individually fit your toes and that might be a really good type of sock that you should get so this way you keep that separation okay number two there is something called silicone toe spreaders okay so this is just a simple device that you can put these uh little spacers between your toes to keep the separation and you would wear these a couple hours in the evening to help start to spread the toes and number three the exercises which is probably going to be the most important thing to focus on now the first exercise you want to do is focusing on rotation of the foot you circles of the foot there good exercise that you can do where you bringing your knee up with your arms okay so you and then you complete circle with your toes clockwise okay and you to focus on the form to make sure you get that complete circle and you it first because there are certain muscles that are too tight in other muscles that are to atrophied or loose but doing this circular exercise will start to put in symmetry into that ankle so you simply start with like 10 rotations clockwise with your right foot okay and then do 10 counterclockwise with your right foot then you would switch to the left foot and do 10 clockwise and 10 counter-clockwise focusing on doing this slow and doing a complete circle without involving uh using the leg so you wanna really isolate that ankle so you rotating the entire lower leg so that would be one exercise to start with and do this each day the second exercise i going to recommend would be just standing on a tennis ball for two minutes now you work up to this but you make sure the tennis ball is right in the mid part of the arch and you do one foot at a time and you all this pressure on the arch and this is really important for people that have flat feet this will start to take pressure off these muscles that are really too tight and give you a lot of relief so what we these exercises is put symmetry uh back into the ankle joint and muscles that are related to that so when you walking you muscles and then this will allow the toe to come back now realize that the what this thing in a certain position is the muscles so what you correcting the muscles the ligaments and the tendons so when you tennis ball you know you might only be able to do it for 10 seconds so you going to gradually start working up to being able to do it for two minutes each foot once a day all right the next exercise would be toe raises okay and you want to start sitting in a chair and you up both left and right at the same time so and this is going to start to strengthen a muscle called the anterior tibialis which are the muscles on the front part of the leg the shin muscles and you want to work up to just doing these 30 times okay 30 times if you start to cramp obviously stop and do what you can but we strengthen on a nice slow uh gradient level the front part of the muscles in the lower leg okay so you sitting in a chair and raising up your toes these are called toe raises and i recommend working up to like 20 of these okay so you might be able to start with 10 and then go 20 and then 30 over time and then once you get good with that you can graduate to doing this standing you on a wall so you degree like maybe you degrees on a wall and you lifting up your toes that way and i put a link down below of a really good video just to kind of give you more information about that so if we to be working on the muscles on the front part of the leg now we need to work also on the back part of the legs so this would be calf raises okay stand straight then push to the balls of your feet and raise your heels until you are standing on your toes to start on a chair back and forth working your way up to 30 repetitions and then when you get good with this then you would start doing it um just standing up okay and you might want to hold the chair or the wall as you do these calf raises you want to work up to 30. now what you muscles and the calf are going to be a lot stronger than the ones on the front part of your shin and this is why it easier to do the calf razors than the toe raises but i want you to do them both and then what you you strengthening the weak length which is the front part of your leg the anterior tibialis and that lot of relief on the big toe and the last exercise would be where you going to be inverting the ankles okay as well as everting the ankles so you going to rock them back and forth while you going to work up to 30 times then when you get better with that you can do this standing so these exercises cover all the dynamics of the motion in your ankle and over time it really put symmetry back into both feet now let more inflammation in one big toe okay not both of them if you want to get some instant relief on that a very simple thing to do would be to massage the opposite toe exactly where it on the right side or the left side you work on the exact opposite side and as you press into the opposite big toe joint okay on the mirror image side you tender but it amount of relief on the side that of course you wouldn if it would only want to do that procedure if it it on both sides what you can do is start massaging with lotion on the inside space between the big toe and the second toe right where you have this little web between the two toes go down a little bit further towards the arch and you very very tender in between the first toe and the second toe i would do that type of massage on both feet it will give you a tremendous amount of relief as you all right so now that you have the basic information the best video for you to watch next is my one on flat feet check it out i put it up right here	Success
5 Simple Things to Reverse Erectile Dysfunction (ED)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2iBcjJsEwg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you know if you have erectile dysfunction and you start doing research on potential solutions man you and the biggest strategies for this condition is all about just managing this condition but what about fixing it they don there different solutions but what we to do is focus more on the problem the pathophysiology the mechanism of how this condition could occur to try to understand the root cause of this so you can resolve this condition so many people assume that it testosterone and they just need to focus on that but there are people with normal testosterone that have erectile dysfunction and there are people with abnormal testosterone or low testosterone and don dysfunction so why is that testosterone is part of the answer but there there with you one of the most important molecules involved in erectile dysfunction is this thing called nitric oxide okay nitric oxide n-o our bodies can make it we can get it from food but apparently nitric oxide decreases as you get older it level of 50 when you reach age 40. and nitric oxide is a major player in erections in fact viagra uses certain nitric oxide pathways and so the most likely reason for someone with erectile dysfunction has to do with a deficiency of this molecule nitric oxide and what i today is all the things that align with this theory okay because the more data you have to back up this theory the more it is made by your endothelial cells that the cells and the inside of the artery and so nitric oxide it has everything to do with helping the arteries vasodilate in fact it called endothelium derived relaxing factor edrf so nitric oxide helps relax your arteries and it increases blood flow not just with erections but also your cardiovascular system and other systems in the body and so if you have low nitric oxide you could have asthma for example so it tone of the vascular system that relates to vasoconstriction and vasodilation nitric oxide increases oxygen release in your blood and so if you don you breathing the 79 of people with sleep apnea have erectile dysfunction and so that link would be the relationship between nitric oxide and cortisol it helps to regulate cortisol which is a stress hormone and it someone has the more cortisol someone has the more stress they have the more they dysfunction in fact someone cannot get an erection when they dominant where there erections occur when you parasympathetic dominant when you have low amounts of stress when you this is why men might get an erection while they more parasympathetic dominant now here another connection that nitric oxide has a profound effect over testicular steroids this means that it helps you make testosterone so there oxide and testosterone if you nitric oxide you to make as much testosterone nitric oxide is also involved in luteinizing hormone that the pituitary gland that controls the testicles and the amount of testosterone you is intimately involved in the sleep cycles including rem sleep this could be also why if someone has sleeping problems insomnia or definitely sleep apnea that they have a greater risk of erectile dysfunction nitric oxide also increases insulin sensitivity this also explains why a diabetic who always has insulin resistance usually also has erectile dysfunction i mean if you think about it what does high sugar do to the inside of your arteries it destroys the endothelial level and thereby decreasing the amount of nitric oxide produced people that are on statin drugs usually have either lower testosterone or they for erectile dysfunction and this could be because statin drugs block cholesterol which is a precursor for making testosterone so the big question now is how do you increase nitric oxide is there a way to do it naturally and the answer is yes number one you can start doing what breathing start breathing through your nose not your mouth apparently when you do that you increase nitric oxide and you can also increase the release of oxygen in your blood by 20 percent by breathing through your nose because there resistance there more resistance with breathing through your nose than your mouth and apparently that increases nitric oxide to your lungs and the rest of your body and it also helps you release oxygen you would think you not going to breathe as much but you actually release more oxygen when you breathe through your nose now if you combine that with number two regular exercise so let example you exercise where you exercise where you intensively if you can breathe through your nose you will then increase nitric oxide and exercise improves your endothelial cells in your vascular system which will then improve nitric oxide now you can also increase nitrates from foods to improve nitric oxide okay the foods that are high in nitrates would be beets okay spinach kale any of the leafy greens those are all high in nitrates and will help you increase nitric oxide now of course on the flip side you would want to avoid sugar because that destroys the inside of the arteries you would want to avoid alcohol too because that also decreases nitric oxide you your stress low because stress can inhibit nitric oxide as well and number five do things to improve your sleep okay that nitric oxide so these are five natural things you can do to overcome the decrease of nitric oxide which comes from aging now there another video if you have not seen this video it relates to nasal breathing but it gives you a little more data it actually very very important especially if you want to reduce cortisol stress levels and even a panic attack so check this out i put it right here	Success
5 Things Your LIPS Can Tell You about Your Nutritional State	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_1fRLt1EW4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now you can get a lot of great information nutritionally with just looking at someone going to talk about how to use the lips to help diagnose what so let gray lips this is usually a situation where you are anemic okay now there would be an iron deficiency anemia and the other one would be a b12 deficiency anemia so it could be either or but if you that could affect your ability to absorb iron and so that can cause the deficiency as well so it could be a lack of copper iron or b12 now normally you get iron in red meat and especially liver and seafood spinach is not a good source of iron despite all those popeye cartoons so as far as the scenarios that you could be iron deficient it could be you just don any meats at all you you vegan it could also be a lack of hydrochloric acid let you that can create a deficiency of iron or let consuming a lot of grains with these phytates phytates are like anti-nutrients they will block the ability to absorb minerals especially iron so if you that could be why you now it could also be that you female and you have heavy periods and you another reason why you also it could be that you have inflammation in your gut let have ibs or some type of crohn diverticulitis or any type of inflammatory problem with the bowels that can definitely stop you from absorbing minerals including b12 now as far as the anemia with b12 that can also be a lack of hydrochloric acid it could also mean that you products because that b12 from animal products and so the same things that can create an iron deficiency could also create a b12 deficiency all right what about if you have blue lips okay well it could be that you just came out of the cold that could be one reason because temperature can drive all the blood internally and create a lack of blood flow to your lips but it can also be other things like you it could also be a cyanide poisoning and just as a side note there remedy for cyanide poisoning i want to bring your attention to it hydroxyl cobolamine it that you can actually order online b12 combines with cyanide to form cyanocobolamine and helping reduce that toxicity now what about if your lips are becoming darker that could be your smoker or exposed to a lot of secondhand smoke so of course smoking has a lot of chemicals smoking decreases oxygen and circulation in the body but smoking will interfere with the pigment melanin too and create a darker appearance on your lips you also notice these vertical wrinkles around the mouth if you right now what about dry lips well there could be a couple different reasons for dry lips the biggest one would be a lack of essential fatty acids uh specifically omega-3 fatty acids and that could be either you consuming enough omega-3 because you don more commonly a situation where you consuming a lot of omega-6 fatty acids that would be in the typical foods that you would eat at a fast food restaurant or even a lot of the other restaurants out there it acids that include corn oil soy oil canola cottonseed oil which is in so many of our foods so a lot of people are heavy on that and they that will just totally dry out in your lips which can also cause you to have chapped lips so dry lips and chapped lips kind of cross over but if you have just generally dry lips i would start to beef up your omega-3 fatty acids with cod liver oil or consuming more salmon things like that wild caught salmon now if you have chapped lips that could be a combination of omega-3 fatty acid deficiency it could also be a vitamin d deficiency which you and so this is why people have chapped lips during the winter and they use carmex or they might use different types of lip balms but that usually dries out the lips because it has a mineral oil make sure you never put anything on your body that has mineral oil because it can extract the fat soluble vitamins that includes taking mineral oil in any of your products because that extract the fat-soluble vitamins and end up drying out things externally and internally it it could also be a zinc deficiency or it could be that you vitamin a so vitamin a toxicity which would usually come from a supplement you high doses maybe you rid of your acne and taking a lot of vitamin a and that is creating the vitamin a toxicity which then will lead to um chapped lips so any one of these imbalances can create that when you have too much vitamin a you can it can actually deplete your vitamin d um so it fat cyber vitamins and of course the best way to get vitamin d is for the sun okay so the sun will give you a good amount of vitamin d um i have a lot of videos on vitamin d i will put some links down below now of course zinc you would get in red meat okay you would also get in seafood shellfish oysters things like that now what about the cracks in the corner of the mouth that is usually a b2 deficiency that usually occurs because you too many refined carbohydrates okay refined carbohydrates will create a b2 deficiency and it can show up as a crack corner of the mouth the other way that people become deficient and the other b vitamins is they microbiome they usually had an antibiotic or they don your microbiome can make b2 and the best diet to give you b2 would be a good amount of eggs egg yolk uh also cheese make sure it cheese not american cheese and the leafy greens will give you a good amount of b2 and of course you gonna have to avoid the refined grains so i just wanted to do this quick video to kind of help you diagnose the inside of your body just by looking at your lips now i have a lot of other videos to help diagnose internal deficiencies by looking at a certain external parts of the body including the nails so that would be a good video for you to check out i put it right here you	Success
The #1 BEST Nutrient for Autoimmune Conditions	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy-jEXIxpSo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we really interesting information relating to an autoimmune disease now if you have an autoimmune condition uh this video is going to enlighten you on a a protocol that you may or may not know about this information is about the cohimbra protocol by dr kohimbra he neurologist this is what he said all or nearly all patients with autoimmune disease have an increased resistance to the effects of vitamin d now we know today there are thousands of scientific peer-review studies linking the vitamin d levels to autoimmune diseases so in other words if you have autoimmune disease chances are you took it one step further and found out that there not just a deficiency of vitamin d there noticed that in order to raise the vitamin d levels in these patients with autoimmune diseases it requires much higher doses than in the average population so for example if you going to maintain vitamin d levels in a healthy person you and this is also based on quite a few credible sources like dr michael hallock who discusses taking 10 000 ius of vitamin d without any chance of toxicity versus the medical health care system in general recommending only 600 ius of vitamin d per day so when you give a patient who has autoimmune disease 10 000 ius of vitamin d3 you may notice only a slight partial improvement so this topic is very very important especially since like 50 million people in the us have autoimmune conditions now vitamin d is not really a vitamin it similar to steroid hormones okay that why it creates some very similar effects to cortisol it anti-inflammatory it helps to calm down and overactive immune system because one of its amazing functions is its ability to act as an immune regulator okay so it regulates the immune system so if your immune system is attacking itself that control and that condition is whether you have ms lupus rheumatoid arthritis crohn common in all those conditions is number one inflammation and a low vitamin d status but my question is since there so much data on this relationship between low vitamin d levels and autoimmune disease why don this more often well i you to vitamin c in scurvy now in 1595 the world faced a serious problem with selling ships sellers were dying there was no cause no cure then in 1601 okay several years later you have captain james lancaster decided to give one teaspoon of lemon juice daily to a certain group of sailors and all of those sailors did not die but a good percentage of those who didn take it died like 40 so it was known back in 1595 that something in lemon juice prevented scurvy which is a very serious deadly condition then in 1753 james lind published a study on scurvy and he concluded a sudden invisible effect for scurvy when you fed these sailors oranges and lemons now you would think this this would be disseminated and people would accept it and the medical profession would welcome this great information right not quite in fact even james lib himself said that it wasn primarily that was a secondary effect he said that scurvy was caused by moisture and you had to keep these sailors in a dry environment then in 1795 gilbert bain persuaded the royal navy to give lemon juice to sailors but it took 70 years later in 1865 before the intake a lemon was finally recommended to prevent scurvy but even that didn so he was soon discredited for about you know 60 more years until they actually discovered vitamin c so vitamin c was discovered in 1932 now even during the civil war which is 1861 through 1865 7 000 union troops died of scurvy another 45 000 troops died in directly of scurvy from dysentery which is an infection that affects the digestive system as well as diarrhea i mean in 1849 when they had the california gold rush 10 000 people died and then the irish famine with the potato crops in 1840s over a million people died of scurvy so what is my point my point is it takes a long time for the medical profession to adopt new ideas so with this whole vitamin d deficiency linked to autoimmune disease it could take you know probably another 150 to i don know 200 years before they really fully accept this and then you have in the meantime people that will will stick to this conventional wisdom even no there the treatment for autoimmune disease is mainly steroids and steroids give some massive massive side effects and vitamin d does not and vitamin d works very similar to the steroid cortisol but without the side effect now when you using higher doses of vitamin d potentially you could get hypercalcemia and the biggest problem with that is kidney stones however when we talk about the protocol next dr kohimbra came up with a solution for this potential side effect but we have to realize is that it takes high high doses of vitamin d over months to create hypercalcemia so vitamin d is not really a vitamin it doesn different than most hormones because hormones have a this very specific target tissue they go after okay like for example the hormone testosterone or cortisol or other hormones or even estrogen they go after very specific tissues but with vitamin d which i don even like to call it a vitamin its receptor its target is in every single cell of the body you have 229 different genes that are directly influenced by vitamin d which relate to 25 000 different functions it is the most important vitamin simply because it does so many different things and so many people are deficient in this vitamin now this is all very interesting but there interesting that i want to share with you right now remember i mentioned the term resistant right you vitamin d one big way someone is resistant to vitamin d is a problem with the vitamin d receptor okay and that condition is called vitamin d polymorphism which is an alteration in the receptor for vitamin d so in other words if someone has this defect in the receptor they absorbing vitamin d they have to take a lot more than a person who doesn this simple to understand you can look at a polymorphism as a mutation which is some change in the genetics now this is very interesting okay you can develop a polymorphic change or a mutation in the gene either through having it inherited from your parents or developing it this life from the environment spontaneously a drug a severe overwhelming stress which could explain why so many people develop autoimmune diseases after a severe loss of a loved one or a severe stress event or a trauma so the more resistant you are to vitamin d the more predisposed you are to getting an autoimmune disease like diabetes type 1 and type 2 cancer bone loss and even hives not to mention all the other factors that cause resistance to vitamin d like the color of your skin the darker your skin the more difficult it is to absorb vitamin d because the pigment melanin blocks the uv radiation which is kind of necessary for the formation of vitamin d through the skin then you have like the metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance factor which can block your ability to absorb vitamin d obesity the more fat you have the less you you have age the older you are the less you then of course we have the diet which is even more difficult to get vitamin d from the diet because there foods that will give it to you unless you fatty fish salmon cod oil things like that and then on top of everything else just not getting exposure to sun people stay inside all the time they don out there to get that sun not to mention if they do they put a bunch of sun lotion on on their body to prevent the uv radiation all right so all that is very interesting but what is the protocol that right now now when doing this protocol it can work with you and i explain why in a second i of a website that you can help locate a doctor that can work with you that knows this protocol because you a test for vitamin d before you start but you dosage of vitamin d by your vitamin d levels why because you have this resistance remember so you going to determine the dosage by measuring something else and that called the parathyroid hormone or what called parathorma when you take vitamin d that suppresses the parathyroid hormone so the more vitamin d you take that gets absorbed the less parathyroid hormone you this whole protocol is to drop your parathyroid hormone into the lower level of the normal range now if your parathyroid hormone is high that usually means that you d or it going in now as far as the amount of vitamin d that someone is going to take it could range anywhere between 40 000 ius per day to 200 000 i use per day depending on a couple factors one being your body weight as well as the parathyroid hormone so typically the rough formula for how much vitamin d you start with would be a thousand iu kilogram of body weight so i weigh 185 pounds so that means i weigh about roughly 84 kilograms which would equate to about 84 000 iu day now to minimize the main side effect of this protocol okay which is kidney stones what he recommends is avoiding calcium okay as a supplement as in hard water okay as in nuts because nuts have a good amount of calcium like in tofu or other soy products which do have calcium and anything related to dairy like milk cheese yogurt etc and on top of that you of fluid a day so you can have the benefits of vitamin d without the the one big side effect which is kidney stones and typically he states it takes roughly about two months to see the changes in the blood consistently but then over the course of two years you parathyroid about four times and making adjustments throughout and then within two years once you you now again this might sound complex or difficult etc but from my point of view if you have an autoimmune disease and you want to weigh out the risks and the benefits of being on prednisone long-term versus doing this i think it the information down below you can click the link i doctor in any way shape or form but it great information for someone that is looking for an alternative to the conventional treatment for autoimmune disease now if you haven on vitamin d toxicity i put that up right here check it out you	Success
The REAL Cause of a Constant Phlegmy (Mucus) Throat	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKp9H9LvlqA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we excuse me one second jeez chronic phlegm in the back of your throat so to really figure this problem out you want to think like an engineer not as a medical professional because when you do research on this you going to quickly find out that it suppressing the symptoms and even classifying these conditions based on their symptoms so it it makes this symptom sound like a disease and unfortunately they enough into the root causes of these issues and then also letting you know what are the more common causes to these symptoms so what i is i mucus generation in your throat and just trace it back to the most likely cause now with this chronic mucus production you can have a post nasal drip you can have chronic coughing more at night than during the day which i definitely have hoarseness or a scratchy throat you can also experience the sensation like a lump in your throat or something stuck in your throat you not sure what it is or even a sore throat when you really don infection so to take an engineering point of view they cause and effect relationship they going to really look at the logic behind this problem instead of just taking this tip of the iceberg symptom and then matching a medication for it to suppress it now you could have an allergy you could have a virus in your sinuses producing this mucus but a more likely cause would be something related to two other symptoms which i get to the root cause but one would be gerd which stands for gastroesophageal reflux disease where you have acid coming up through this valve at the top of the stomach and it coming up through your esophagus or this other condition called lpr that stands for laryngopharyngeal reflux and so really the basic difference between gerd okay and lpr because they valve is not closing and so we getting acid that comes up with gerd into the esophagus but with lpr we getting acid that comes up higher into the vocal cords into the back of the throat and each one of these conditions is classified as a certain condition that antacids and other medications that suppress acid in your stomach now if you have mucus in your throat you want to ask yourself if you have all these other symptoms that are related to that so with gerd you would have heartburn you would have belching you would have regurgitation you could have excess mucus throat irritation you can have a lump in your throat difficulty breathing because when there throat your ability to get oxygen dramatically decreases so you difficulty swallowing sometimes post nasal drip with that and it you valve again is not closing correctly and you may have food allergies which i talk more about that and then with this other condition called lpr you to get a lot of those symptoms but you also may have like a metallic taste in your mouth and more irritation in your vocal cords like hoarseness when you deeper into the root cause of these issues i want to just talk first about some of the treatments which can even cause the condition and aggravate the condition even more for example antacids a big side effect would be constipation even acid reflux and then you have these other medications that are work a little bit differently they called ppis protein pump inhibitors so they basically stop the enzymes that are producing um acid and they also have side effects of constipation gas risk for stroke risk of getting c diff which is an infection because it pathogen palpitations and even high blood pressure then you have another side effect called hypergastronemia now what is that that is too much gastrin which is going to cause too much acid in your stomach so here you are trying to get rid of your acid by taking a solution that doesn problem with these treatments is that they will remove acid and now you going to have a difficult time absorbing minerals like calcium and magnesium so now we have a problem with bones muscles and the list goes on and on and on but of course there you can get a surgery you can tighten this valve even more but there are some slight minor complications like inability to belch anymore or burp increase gas in your digestive system a greater need for more antacids and those ppis that i just talked about so ultimately the optimum solution to something should not give you a bigger problem than you started out with right so let talk about the most likely cause of this valve not closing giving you this gerd or lpr not too much acid it would be an acid deficiency low hydrochloric acid when the acid or concentration of acid in your stomach is lower the valve um doesn in fact it can open up but when the acid starts increasing when you start digesting things like proteins the top of the valve should close very very nice and tight if everything is working correctly so the root cause of this valve not closing is basically you don and that is the underlying reason and because you have acid reflux you thinking wow i have too much acid i need to get rid of this acid so i antacid or or i will do something to reduce the acid but the root cause is actually you don hydrochloric acid in your stomach is a very important fluid um for many different things especially within your immune system one of the purposes of this very strong acid which should be between one and three is to kill pathogens believe it or not your stomach is very sterile okay nothing can live because that acid is so strong and this is one of the barriers that your body puts up in the immune system because if we can kill pathogens that come from our food into the stomach and prevent them from going down to the rest of the tract we have a very good defense against these pathogens but if we have weak acid in the stomach pathogens can escape and get into the system and create all sorts of problems in the lower part of the digestive system and even in the small intestine you can get what intestinal bacterial overgrowth and that occurs because you didn microbes at the stomach level another very important purpose of this hydrochloric acid is to break down proteins to break down proteins fully okay so if you don acid in your stomach you incomplete protein digestion and start to create stress in the other parts of the digestive system because they have to produce more enzymes and they have to do different things lower in the tract and that throws off your whole digestion now if you compound this with inflammation okay in the gut and you have something called leaky gut syndrome these proteins go right into the little holes where you have leaky gut and your immune system starts creating antibodies against these proteins and that autoimmune diseases that an allergy and then the third reason why we need this hydrochloric acid in our stomach is in your ability to absorb minerals okay so without that ph the minerals don travel into the body that well so this is one of the underlying reasons why people are anemic or they have mineral deficiencies they cannot absorb minerals calcium magnesium potassium zinc iodine all these minerals but also this strong ph triggers things in your pancreas to release certain enzymes as well as in your gallbladder to release bile so without this concentrated hydrochloric acid in the stomach being at what ph should be for the entire digestive system starts to go downhill real fast and on top of everything else the sensing mechanism doesn that valve to close tightly and then the acid starts regurgitating you may even get regurgitation of the bile up into the stomach and both hydrochloric acid and bile can then regurgitate up through the esophagus up into your throat and this irritates the back of the throat and puts you in a constant state of mucous protection that mucus is trying to be formed an attempt to protect against the strong acid that is dissolving your tissues so what i is the most likely root cause of this mucous production this chronic irritation your throat that makes you cough so now that we know that the solution is very simple because we don want to necessarily suppress the symptom we want to fix the root cause we want to now increase the amount of acid in the stomach and by the way you have to figure out with help of your doctor how you can start to wean off some of these antacids and if you interested just ask them this one question what are the long-term effects what are the chronic effects of taking antacids over a period of time and what um you know i to find out what they say but it probably be something along the lines of well it and as we age most people just have these problems but the way to get your acid back is to take um something to start building up the hydrochloric acid and the best remedy is betaine hydrochloride okay betaine hydrochloride and you want to take between three to four to even five to six even seven right before you eat okay so that i would recommend now here with certain types of people that take this if you have an ulcer because this condition has gone on too far or if you have gastritis there inflammation in the stomach and you take betaine hydrochloride it it worse because the tissues are inflamed in which case you the lining of your stomach first which could take anywhere between two to three months okay before you start adding more acid to the system but you need to understand the mechanism here you need to know that ultimately you want to acidify the stomach and get it back to normal so if that is the case and you have an ulcer or you have gastritis you can watch that video i will put that link down below you could probably benefit greatly by taking zinc carnosine if you don betaine hydrochloride can greatly greatly help you in addition to that there you need to do because the foods that you are not helping you and the biggest offender for this problem is grains okay grains now what that if you look this up they will tell you to consume grains to improve your acid reflux but in reality you a lot worse there grains that are inflammatory okay that create sensitivity allergies autoimmune conditions even lower your immune system and dump a lot of omega-6 fatty acids into the system a typical grain has like 20 or more times the omega-6 than it does the omega-3 which are anti-inflammatory so you dumping a lot of inflammation in your system when you consume grains and consume animal products that were fed a lot of heavy grains versus grass-fed brass finished animal products so i to think with this and think outside the box and see if you can start to sort out your own diet and what you need to change now it fasting and not follow the well just have uh five or six small meals through the day no no no you don want to do intermittent fasting because the more that you do intermittent fasting when you fast a period of time at least 16 17 18 hours by skipping your breakfast you can now give your digestive system a chance to rest and heal and recover because it triggered by foods now another big cause of this entire problem and i stomach acids and a lack of bile salts okay which can inhibit your ability to digest fats is a vegan diet okay when someone they consume a lot of grains and a lot of foods that tear up their digestive system and they don fats and because they lot of animal proteins they might not have the triggering of this hydrochloric acid so the combination of all these inflammatory foods and also the missing nutrients that are in a vegan diet can create havoc on your digestive system now that being said there is a correct way to do a vegan diet so i not opposed of doing it correctly but i am opposed to doing it with all the different fake meats and the soy protein isolates and the grains and the sugar etc etc now i hope there are some good takeaways from this video but i think the next most important video for you to watch would be on hydrochloric acid check it out i put it right here you	Success
Female Bladder Leakage (THE BEST NATURAL SOLUTION)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0PRBRC4oNs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	i potential underlying cause for an overactive bladder a leaky bladder a bladder that can a bladder that causes you to go more frequently and sometimes even frequent urination at night so let problem because there confusions about the underlying cause okay and of course the treatments have side effects but many of the medications that they use for this condition are anti-cholinergic now what does that mean it means that they block a certain neurotransmitter called acetylcholine now acetylcholine is kind of like a um a hormone within the nervous system that affects the pelvic floor as well as the mechanisms that allow you to contract and relax your bladder and that whole system collectively is called the autonomic nervous system so the drugs that they use for leaky bladder really are affecting the autonomic nervous system which makes sense because one of the root dysfunctions is neurogenic which means it system the other cause that they talk about is idiopathic that is a fancy term that means unknown cause okay and what we do know about the idiopathic or unknown causes of a leaky bladder is that a major cause for that is you guessed it insulin resistance okay that high amounts of insulin which then leads to alteration within your autonomic nervous system so when you have this imbalance or dysfunction within the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic can affect the muscle called the detrusor muscle so now the confusing part about this when you do research on it they pretty much focus in on estrogen okay a loss of estrogen especially after menopause because of course when you go through menopause your estrogen drops so you definitely have a hormonal problem that can definitely affect the bladder as well as the vaginal area and many other parts of the body but the problem is when you give someone with a leaky bladder estrogen it doesn to solve the problem it nerve related problem within the autonomic nervous system which can be greatly affected when you have insulin resistance so this problem gets worse when you age when you uh when you have childbirth especially multiple childbirths because that going to affect those muscles that help you contract and relax because that structure it stretch out uh the valve that controls um the release of urine through your bladder and then also there that aggravate it like chronic constipation uh obesity problems with chronic coughing and asthma and of course the usual stuff people that drink a lot of tea and coffee these things can all aggravate the condition not to mention this condition getting worse when you under stress which makes a lot of sense because of how stress influences the autonomic nervous system so the first thing i going to recommend is something that might just solve it without having to even try any herbal remedies or even the kegel exercises and that would be addressing this insulin resistance insulin resistance dramatically and negatively affects the autonomic nervous system so a lot of problems connected to that will disappear when you address this insulin resistance i healthy keto and intermittent fasting and really do it for real where you refined carbs you under i would say 25 grams per day you ketogenic diet as well as doing intermittent fasting so you for 18 hours and you have an eating window of six hours so that will help frequent urination especially in men at night it your problem really is the autonomic nervous system you affect positively the function of your bladder control because and the reason i saying this is because if you jump right to the herbs the remedy and you don fix this foundational eating problem and you don herbs may not nearly have the impact that they should and you might just kind of chalk it up to well another remedy didn let me go for the medications the problem is they create side effects so i would highly recommend starting with the healthy version of the ketogenic diet within a minute of fasting okay that number one number two kegel exercises okay now this will help put more control into your bladder because urination is both involuntary and voluntary and if you start to do these exercises you start to put more control into the voluntary part of those muscles how do you do that well number one you ensure that your bladder is empty you want to land your back maybe on your bed okay with your knees up you want to keep your lower back curve so you don want to flatten the curve in your lower back you can even roll up a towel and put that in your lower back but that way it rocks your pelvis forward then you want to lift and squeeze the pelvic opening okay and you do that for a count of five seconds okay you then you for five seconds and you back and forth for about 10 times okay and then just do this three times a day spread out through the day and these exercises have been done for many years and with a very positive effect as far as the herbal remedies there great data that i found searching for patents using herbal or natural remedies for an overactive bladder and i information in the description as well one of these patents actually has a very hard core study that was double-blinded placebo control and it showed significant improvements and i did a deep dive on these three herbs and guess what i found they affect the autonomic nervous system surprise so the first herb is called cretiva nirvala stem bark and another name for this is varuna number two horsetail and number three lindura agrigata so i put these three herbs in the description so you can do your research and try to find maybe a product that has all three but definitely start with the healthy version of keto within a minute of fasting and i below if you i have a just a free download you can go to my site just download it and it tell you exactly how to do

The Hidden Reason Why You Feel OLDER Than Your Age	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YUDXGeMjAY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you know i anti-aging principles how to look more youthful but today we how to feel more youthful how to feel younger and nobody likes to feel old regardless of their age and so what do i mean feeling old i stiffness are your joints stiff do you have achy muscles okay that called myalgia do you have inflammation in your joints do you have brain fog a lack of clarity is your mood not where it should be you have this symptom called malaise which is just a general feeling of unwellness or something called post exertional malaise which you feel fatigued if you do any exercise so as soon as you start exercising or exerting yourself you feel like wow there is just not on the same page or do you have fatigue or a lack of energy with just crappy sleep if you have any of these symptoms you video now i think most people know that your diet is behind most of these problems but there another hidden cause that i want to make you aware of that is actually quite common especially if you have chronic fatigue in fact roughly 70 of the actual cause of chronic fatigue is not necessarily related to your diet it viruses it one time but it right now it it can be reactivated as any of the symptoms i just described so here you are you on the right diet but you don could be one of these latent viruses that of viruses that are more latent viruses are the herpes viruses like herpes simplex 1 2 the epstein-barr virus cytomegalovirus and even hiv is capable of being latent and so is hepatitis so these sneaky little viruses have a survival mechanism um to go underneath the radar so they can kind of go deep in themselves and just wait okay and they wait for a door to open they wait for the switch to be triggered and that number one most common switch is ready for this stress so does stress actually make you feel old or tired well in actuality it could be reactivating viruses that are then creating an immune response not a full-blown infection but immune response that can make you feel like you you feel run down you feel kind of old now what viruses especially the herpes viruses is that the great majority of the population i 87 of the population has been infected with herpes and apparently regarding epstein-barr virus or mono 95 of the population has been infected with this virus so given the fact that the majority of the population has this virus and they also go through stress it i described are very very very common even covet and its variants can lower your t cell and reactivate some of these other viruses so in other words if someone had a covered infection that could reactivate some of these other issues can put a person to the state where they have brain fog ahead joints inflammation a lowered mood poor sleep long after the covet infection so the number one most important thing to do is to isolate what is stressing you out and do whatever you can to improve that situation so go ahead and type into the comment section what type of stress do you have right now so to feel younger it the stress part now there remedy that i researched that very very potent to help target these viruses that are related to latency it won if you still have this stress and it definitely won basic diet is not correct as well so i think it would work to a very large degree if your stress is manageable and you are on the right eating plan and if you don i exactly what you should be eating hands down the strongest herb that can help deal with these viruses is sweet wormwood root this is a chinese herb that years it chinese remedy and it of things but it its potent effects against malaria so it and antivirals at least certain viruses that are related to the viruses i mentioned apparently they don don but apparently it injects free radicals or oxidation into this pathogen there a tremendous amount of research on this that i below for fatigue for stiffness for inflammation for brain fog for symptoms that that persist long after someone has a covert infection so there are a lot of herbal remedies that you could use olive leaf is a good one oregano oil sage garlic thyme but sweet wormwood is probably one of the better ones so anyway i wanted to share this with you but really make sure that your diet is implemented correctly and you do whatever you can to deal with the stress simply because i don any remedy is going to work unless the stress is dealt with because it overriding dominating factor in someone the next video for you to watch would be the one on stress i put that up right here check it out	Success
The Dangers of Urinary Retention on Your Kidneys	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME8jjIwYMRY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	urinary retention what is it well it situation where your bladder is not releasing all the urine so any urine that is retained sometimes can back up in the system it can create congestion within the kidney and lead to a lot of complications i retention and also a really good solution one third of the adult population and 80 percent of females have some form of bladder issue it could be the sensation of having to urinate but not a lot of urine comes out so how does this affect someone well the kidney is a filter and it the blood it works very closely with the liver which by the way also filters out the blood to some extent it helps to break down caffeine alcohol medications toxins and so the liver and the kidney work together if you fully eliminate all your urine that can lead to edema in your feet or in your lower legs it can lead to a loss of protein in the urine which you might identify as albumin and so when you lose too much protein then the protein in the blood goes down and then the tissues start backing up with fluid now when you urinate and you smell a very strong odor in your urine like this super pungent ammonia smell that has to do with the incomplete breakdown of proteins there called the urea cycle where your liver is breaking down protein and as it breaks down to ammonia it then break down to urea and it should be eliminated through the urine but what happens if this whole biochemical pathway doesn you in your urine and it can even back up into the blood it can go to the brain and it can lead to all sorts of additional symptoms like brain fog even very extreme to the point where you lose consciousness so smelling too much ammonia in the urine is not good now if you may have sugar in the urine and by the way the number one cause of kidney damage is too much sugar or a diabetes situation that neuropathy but nephropathy nephropathy means there now if you have a problem with the metabolism of protein guess what you going to lose a muscle the term for that is called sarcopenia and it happens that someone gets older because you not able to get the protein into your muscles and your tissues other complications of this would be fatigue you can experience itchiness and like i said brain fog so before i get into what to do about this uh let causes it okay uh diabetes does because the high levels of sugar damage the capillaries of your kidneys so the nephron which is the little filter in your kidneys basically it small blood vessels that help filter the blood and high levels of sugar flowing through your blood damage those arteries that create scar tissue and they can create permanent damage and on top of it when someone is a diabetic they meals and that alone will cause a tremendous amount of retention of fluid an average person on a high carb diet is carrying around i would say anywhere between 11 and 13 pounds of extra fluid see the goal is to get rid of this fluid not to retain it so we need to understand why the kidney would retain fluid it could be your diabetic you carbs it could be simply you getting older and you to have a loss of these little nephrons or filters in the kidney now it also could be in a large prostate pushing up into the bladder that can cause you to retain urine as well or if you have a fibroid which is pushing up into the bladder now another common situation is the huge amount of sodium people consume with very very low amounts of potassium an average or standard american diet is heavy on the sodium uh including monosodium glutamate and very low in potassium as in high potassium foods like vegetables and the reason i know that is because the average person only consumes one and a half cups of vegetables every single day that definition of vegetables is very very wide it could be a potato it could be corn it could be that tomato v8 juice all right another common cause of bladder retention is a problem with the autonomic nervous system that system that controls the contraction and relaxation of the urinary bladder as well as a lot of the valves in your private part and so if you have a problem let have your sympathetic dominant and you don alone can create a loss of capacity to hold urine eliminate urine control the valve which also controls the release of urine and on top of that the more pregnancies a female has the more things get stretched out of the normal form then you also have kidney stones and bladder stones that can back up the urine in the kidneys and and then the rest of the body as well and lastly medications antidepressants other medications have a side effect of causing urinary retention okay well that do about it well number one probably a very important thing to do is to start cutting out your carbohydrates and sugar because that is usually the thing that is destroying the kidney so we want to stop the bleeding and stop the oxidation and damage to these little capillaries not to mention you to dump a lot of water you gonna dump between 11 and 13 pounds within the first week or two so that take a lot of stress off the kidney all right number two you do want to increase your fluids to help build up more volume to add more pressure to start cleaning out the kidneys and the associated pipes or tubules that are connected so i would recommend drinking about three liters of fluid that that hard and i would highly recommend that you drink this in the first part of the day not the second part of the day especially right before bed now the other thing that you can do is uh instead of taking a synthetic drug as a diuretic and i medication check with your doctor i saying there are alternatives there are natural herbs that act as a diuretic okay one of them is dandelion greens you can go to the grocery store and you can just buy those and put those into your salad okay it the other powerful diuretic that i recommend would be watercress at the grocery store or health store they sell watercress it that and it vegetables ever consumed by humans it a potent diuretic now next point is potassium you want to increase your potassium why because potassium is a natural diuretic it pushes fluid out and so the way you do that is you consume more vegetables and i least seven cups per day now it might seem like a lot but you can just break it up through the meals and it doesn could be like celery it could be asparagus other leafy greens now you can also enhance this with a good high quality electrolyte powder that has a lot of potassium and yes i do recommend my brand because it will put a link down in the description now the phytonutrients in these salads also will protect you against whatever condition you have like if you have some type of chronic i don know diabetes or arthritis or existing chronic kidney damage or inflammation these phytonutrients are very very powerful to lessen the complications from that issue so they will greatly lessen the symptoms that you have even if you never get rid of this condition and lastly if you have this strong ammonius type urine this odor it wouldn overloading the liver and kidney with more protein i recommend doing a moderate amount of protein with each meal not a high protein meal so consume between three to six ounces of protein per meal but don higher than that that way you won overload your liver and your kidney and you consuming now there video for you to watch on the kidney i put it up right here check it

The Deeper Reason Why Anxiety Causes Bad Breath	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm98s6f9HHY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you know in the morning i usually bring my wife coffee and uh usually i dive in researching and things and of course i always bring up some interesting conversations when she morning i came in there and i said hey karen have you ever pondered this idea on the relationship between someone diversity of course she just gives me that look like what and then i proceeded to talk about is it the microbial imbalance that can alter someone or is it the mood that can affect the microbiome and her response was i need more coffee so anyway hopefully you about this but the relationship between your mood and your microbiome is very very interesting if you are in kind of a state of anxiety chronic stress and worry or depression your microbiome greatly changes okay and your breath changes as well and this is why when someone um their breath can become pretty nasty when someone is in a depressed state chronically they can develop halitosis even the pathogenic microbes that give off that sulfur smell are increased when you a lot of the protective friendly bacteria are diminished someone who even at risk for periodontal infections and disease when they stress but typically when someone is stressed or has anxiety or some even a panic attack their breath changes dramatically and on the flip side of that when someone takes an antibiotic or an antifungal and they wipe out their microbial population that can dramatically affect their mood and their breath because you these microbial communities so this is why one of the big side effects from an antibiotic is an overgrowth of yeast in your mouth like thrush that gives off kind of a bad odor and if you look at some of the side effects from antibiotics you could have psychosis major depression anxiety and even panic attacks now as far as one reason for this physical reason we have this spike in cortisol when we go through panic attacks when we go through chronic stress we have or worry we have this spike in cortisol cortisol it greatly suppresses the diversity of the different types of species of microbes that you have and it basically paralyzes your immune system which your microbes are a big big part this is why chronic elevation of cortisol can affect your breath because it destroys the microbes i mean if you even think about when someone cries for example it affects their entire physiology and the same thing that happens when someone is actually in a chronic state of depression so brushing your teeth or using perfumes or breath mints are not going to work unless you handle the source of depression or handle the source of anxiety or worry but on the flip side if you had an antibiotic and that affect your mood you have to reestablish this microbial life but one thing you have to realize and this is something new for a lot of people is you don just have strains of bacteria you have a complex group of friendly bacteria friendly yeast friendly fungus and they all work together very similar to the microbes in the soil like when you gardening you need the right ratios of bacteria to the fungal population if you enough fungus you the mobilization of the nutrients and so we don we want the correct ratio of fungus to bacteria the same thing in your gut you should start eating foods that are fermented for example that have healthy yeast as well as bacteria like kefir like sauerkraut things like that so you have the microbiome okay that also have mycobiome that population of friendly funguses in your body so we need both and so when you take an antibiotic and you kill off your microbes and then you get a yeast infection it these yeast and fungus now become competitive they no longer are friendly i wanted to just increase your awareness that your mood can affect your microbes and your microbes can also affect your mood and you want to identify what is the real cause of that and you can use your breath as an indicator of what happening to your microbes because the quality of your breath is directly related to mainly your balance of the right microbes i know i videos on chronic stress and depression and there can be some nutritional reasons for that like vitamin d is the best nutrient for depression and vitamin b1 is the best antidote for anxiety so you might want to try that but also just being out in the sun being out in nature getting more space changing your environment is so so so important versus being stuck in the house watching the news all day very very bad to keep your mood up now as far as exercise goes if you compare physical work outside to going to a gym on a treadmill the physical workout side is going to be hands down way better as a therapy because it gets your mind off the stress way more than being on a treadmill especially when you on the treadmill but i do want to say one of the best exercises that i found for for mental stress is indoor rock climbing boy there doing rock climbing just to extract you from your stress but you can do the same thing with hiking outside and there exercises that will help now of course your diet is something that i would really focus on because if you if you you intermittent fasting especially boy that mood for sure but just implementing intermittent fasting has a dramatic effect on the cognitive function it bring you out of anxiety and put you in a great state of mind now i put some links down below some great videos that you can watch on how to re-establish the friendly flora in your gut but if you haven on panic attacks it you can do to pull yourself out of not just a panic attack but any type of anxiety or stress check it out right here you	Success
The #1 Best Antihistamine Remedy for Sinus, Itching and Hives	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YE8BZkN8Vo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let remedies to act as an antihistamine now histamine is involved in the immune reaction it the symptoms that are related to an allergy the problem is that sometimes the body over responds or it inappropriately responds to a potential allergen and you get a series of very uncomfortable symptoms whether it fever runny nose itchy eyes well itchy anywhere in the body flushing response dermatitis that skin photosensitivity that sensitivity to the sun sneezing fatigue and even wheezing because of the constriction of your bronchial tubes and the more histamine reaction you have the more cortisol response you have too because cortisol is the natural body chemical that helps to neutralize these histamines and if someone has adrenal fatigue or let into some allergy reaction they going to have this buffering effect or antidote to histamines and so the histamines are just going to rise way too high so i want to give you a natural remedy that you can use as needed to help minimize these histamine symptoms and this remedy is cursive tim kerosen has been thoroughly studied from a lot of different angles and there i can check out so what does it do well it inhibits the cells that make histamines they called mast cells and so a mast cell is an immune cell that releases histamines and so if we can inhibit the mast cell we can reduce the histamine piercing also directly inhibits the histamine response and it also stabilizes the mast cell membrane which is exactly how a lot of antihistamines work so you can look at kerosene as a natural zyrtec it will reduce mucus and inflammation as well now there several ways we get this natural plant compound okay you can eat foods high in quercetin which would be the red onion especially the outer part close to the root it kale it you can get kerosene in a supplement and i would recommend taking it in quantities between 400 and 600 milligrams depending on your size and because there kirsitin roughly about two hours i would take it every two hours until you get some significant relief now the thing about these plant-based compounds is a lot of them are fat soluble including piercing so you would want to take it with a little bit of fat to increase the absorption you can take it with a little bit of coconut oil or butter all you need is just a little bit now to increase the bioavailability even more maybe you can get curiositin with bromeline which is another compound that can help you absorb kerosene now this is a very effective remedy but i going to work 100 of the time or it going to be 100 effective so i to give you several other things that you can take that will enhance this effect okay and vitamin d is at the top of the list okay and i would take no less than 20 000 iu also recommend taking zinc okay i would take about 50 milligrams of zinc and the last remedy that i really like recommending would be nettle root okay this is a great anti-inflammatory it allergies it depending on the severity of your problem maybe you want to stick just with piercing or add some of these additional things to really create a more potent effect now since we the topic of the immune system i think the next most appropriate video for you to watch would be this one right here check it out you	Success
The 2 BEST Foods for Your Teeth and Gums	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNs1VYAXkS4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you know growing up i had the worst teeth i had cavities and every single tooth i was always at the dentist the only thing good about the dentist is they would give you a lollipop and i really wish i would have known what i know now back then because it could have saved me a lot of problems with my teeth but i want to share with you the best two foods that you should be eating for your teeth now you can skip forward to get right to those two foods but i want to first talk about why you should consume these two foods the first thing is vitamin a in relationship to your teeth and gums okay vitamin a supports a lot of things but it in the internal skin and mucous membranes of your body especially the gums and vitamin a increases the resistance to infection of the mucous membranes so if you much more susceptible to getting an infection especially of the gums and there is a condition called pyrea which is basically gum disease that occurs when you and so there problems it starts out with inflammation of the gums called gingivitis and then it can progress into something more serious called periodontitis which involves more complications with the gums redness chronic halitosis bad breath infection plaquing things like that one thing you should know about the plaque on your teeth or tartar that candida a type of fungus that can grow so in your mouth you have friendly bacteria and you have friendly yeast or fungus that hacks that keep everything in check it of balance that you start developing an overgrowth of yeast and fungus and bacteria and that can develop tartar and plaque and the byproduct of those guys is acids that then create cavities now of course the thing that starts the whole thing is the fuel that you these pathogens and that would be sugar so people that have high sugar in the diet or carbohydrates have a lot more of the unfriendly bacteria in their mouth that create the cavities and so this data between sugar and cavities was suppressed in the early 70s there will share down below so instead they shifted their attention on saturated fats and away from sugar but out of all the foods you should avoid for your teeth and gums sugar is at the top of the list so vitamin a is really really important with your your gums now if you have periodontitis okay and you have enough vitamin c you probably retain your teeth okay you teeth and you probably won much bleeding but if you actually combine a vitamin c deficiency you lose a tooth and you in scurvy for example which is a severe vitamin c deficiency one indication of a vitamin c deficiency would be bleeding gums because of what vitamin c does to your connective tissue and it keeps the capillaries from leaking blood so vitamin c is very important in keeping the connective tissue especially of your gums really nice and tight and strong as well as building up your resistance to infection so as you know vitamin c is important in your immune system then we have vitamin b1 now the reason i is because if you have a tooth that hurting you have like some nerve involvement okay neuritis and vitamin b1 is the best remedy for any type of itis or inflammation of the nerve so taking b1 can help a toothache now of course the underlying cause of that needs to be corrected but at least can give you relief as well as chewing on a clove okay clove will help numb the tooth okay so you might want to try that as well now then we have this thing called vitamin f now what is vitamin f well it acids and vitamin f works with calcium it helps to unload calcium as one of its functions so if you look at vitamin d and vitamin k2 and vitamin f they all work in this one specific function of helping you absorb calcium transport calcium and then dumping calcium in the right places so vitamin d is vital for absorbing calcium from your intestine to your blood and then vitamin k2 is important in transporting calcium to the right areas of the body to the bone to the teeth okay and not in the wrong places and then vitamin f has a function of helping unload this calcium and uh pushing it into the tissues so given that information what foods would have most of these vitamins well butter in cod liver oil okay now when we about grass-fed okay and organic or you can do the ghee this is loaded with vitamin d f vitamin k2 especially and vitamin a okay and so all these are fat soluble nutrients or vitamins so butter is really good for the teeth and gums as a child of course with a lot of teeth problems i craved butter so much i would literally sit down and consume a stick of butter without even questioning it i just love butter and reflecting back is because i needed these nutrients okay unfortunately i was consuming a massive amount of sugar and refined carbs at the same time and one point about vitamin c and sugar is that the chemistry of sugar and vitamin c is very similar so if you consuming all the sugar you to be able to absorb vitamin c at the same time okay so that was my problem and the second food is cod liver oil now why is cod liver oil so good for the teeth and gums and why is it so unique and different from regular fish oils okay well cod liver oil not only has the omega three fatty acids that other fish oils have but it also has vitamin d and vitamin a whereas other fish oils usually don a so it has these two extra things that are very very good for you it difficult to get vitamin d from your foods but cod liver oil has a really good amount of it so with with collard oil you get these fat soluble vitamins and this nutrient which is you can call it a vitamin or you can just call it a essential fatty acid combination now you could also do cod liver you can buy this in a can it quite delicious i will put a link down below if you haven it actually comes in all the oil as well but if you consume the whole thing it a bit too rich so if you consume it you have like maybe half of it and then half the second day but eat it up within two days because if you leave it too long it does get a little fishy okay eggs also have a lot of these fat soluble nutrients and then greens okay and i that my favorite which is sauerkraut or even kimchi that c as well as probiotics and vitamin k2 so sauerkraut is really really good for your teeth and gums and then as far as the b vitamins go nutritional yeast is a good source but you have to realize that your gut also makes a lot of your b vitamins so if you don the gut flora or you chances are that could be the reason why you deficient in bees so just realize that these microbes can give you these b vitamins as well now probably the next best video for you to watch would be the one on cod of oil i quite a few but this one is very interesting check it out you	Success
The Best Natural Protocol for Bipolar Disorder and OCD	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49NTJ4bWgLA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so i protocol for not only bipolar disorder but ocd obsessive compulsive disorder and i first just want to mention this is not to replace your medical care check with your doctor before implementing this i just want to give you another viewpoint i want to give you another option because it a protocol that would really potentially work for you and unfortunately the current treatment for these two conditions have a lot of side effects first of all there medications that inhibit the reuptake of serotonin so you increase the serotonin in the body and then they potentially might give you intravenous chlomepramine or deep brain stimulation where they into your brain or even functional neurosurgery so some people might even consider you when you look up alternatives for these conditions you alternative treatments are dangerous and they might have side effects but for example fish oils was given to someone like 10 times the normal value and and they had some side effects but what about all the drug side effects and really what is the potential reason why you might have these conditions in the first place that about but one thing to know is the mechanism of of how some of these medications work is through manipulating neurotransmitters and the missing information that a lot of people need to know related to that is that your gut your friendly microbes make a tremendous amount of neurotransmitters so if you have gut problems okay that you better work on that because the microbiome the friendly bacteria are probably not making enough neurotransmitters and i serotonin i norepinephrine dopamine and so people who have bipolar disorder have a much higher incidence of inflammation in their gut than people that don there here if you have gut issues okay fix that first how do you do that i videos down below but basically you need to start consuming foods that give you the pre pre-biotic and the probiotic so i foods sauerkraut kimchi maybe a high quality kefir definitely a probiotic that alone can create a huge stabilizing influence over your mood and of course i jump right down to six one thing that will create inflammation in your gut is grains so you must get rid of all grains in your diet as well as sugar both of these things will severely destroy your gut and i know quite a few people who just get rid of the gluten out of the diet and they also cut down the sugar and magically these symptoms go away so with the gut you need to put in the good bacteria and the good friendly microbes and take away the things that are causing the inflammation and i talking about the grain oils like soy oil corn oil canola cottonseed oil those oils are highly inflammatory number two your brain works much better on a low carb ketogenic diet than on a high carb sugar diet so any time we with mental mood disorders or cognitive problems your brain is going to be much happier on ketones okay so you go low carb and if you have gut problems like ibs or inflammation your gut you may even want to do the carnivore version of the ketogenic diet where you for some people that is very very beneficial so we brain on ketones okay and support the gut the two most important things third most important thing is fish oils okay now i recommend cod liver oil just because it has some additional things like vitamin d and vitamin a not to mention the omega-3 fatty acids but omega-3 fatty acids greatly reduces inflammation in the brain and it studied to produce a significant effect for these disorders and by the way i going to put those links down below but a very good high quality fish oil is essential and realize it does take probably about a month to work so just start taking it consistently and it going to help reduce inflammation in the brain and it brain directly now the next thing that very very important is number four that b vitamins your brain needs b vitamins desperately neurotransmitters work with the b vitamins now if you have ocd vitamin b1 is essential because it can really help control your focus dramatically and get rid of nervous tension as well so b1 is important and folate okay folate not folic acid get the folate version which is the natural version very important and make sure that you get natural b vitamins nutritional yeast is a really good source versus a lot of the synthetic versions that they have now these are mandatory but these are optional okay so we have lithium orotate very effective for bipolar disorder then you have another one called n-acetyl cysteine nac if you it n-acetyl cysteine which is very effective for the mania part of bipolar because it helps to regulate glutamate which is an amino acid in the brain now many times when people have bipolar or ocd they may have depression and if you have depression hyperforin which is an extract of st john for depression not to mention vitamin d and then if you also have schizophrenia i would recommend adding glycine but you need to take a lot of it you want to take 28 grams three times a day so that tell or make it by your weight you would want to take 0.8 grams per kilogram of weight if you want to get the exact amount but this can also help greatly to minimize this condition right here and then you might want to add the niacin which is vitamin b3 to put the icing in the cake because niacin has been known to greatly improve schizophrenia so anyway i just wanted to give you this protocol so you have some alternative plan that you can use to help yourself now at this point i think it important to get the basic eating plan that you would need to get and for that information i put that up right here you	Success
7 Reasons Why You NEED TO SWEAT More Often	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcQbIKbbrrU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let sweat more often did you realize that we spend over 75 billion dollars a year just to block sweat for some reason people don to sweat they don and above all don you actually sweat now sweat itself doesn bacteria that ferment certain things in the sweat that produce various types of odor and a lot of times when you deodorants that plug up your pores that sweat material gets blocked and it ferments more and it can create a worse odor but there are two types of sweat glands you have certain glands that produce an oil that is connected with a hair follicle like underneath your armpit and then you have other sweat glands that produce more of a salty uh fluid but the overall purpose of sweat is your body control temperature to dump heat so you can keep moving and you prevent heat stroke it a lot of sweat in fact we can lose between two and four liters of sweat every single hour that amount of fluid coming out of our body and when people are in fear or under major stress when they sweating it has a completely different odor now if we look at the consistency of sweat what you have 0.9 grams it liter of sodium so there sodium and if we look at potassium it only 0.2 grams per liters and then if we look at calcium it 0.015 grams per liter and then magnesium is 0.013 grams per liter then there lot of other things in sweat you have chloride you have fatty acids you have even glucose proteins so sweat is really the same chemistry as the fluid that you have in your blood minus the red blood cells and the fluid that is in between your cells and the capillaries okay so it salty fluid and in your sweat glands you even actually recycle some of these minerals as well but this is what you need to know an average person consumes about 3 300 milligrams of sodium every single day okay and they consume about 2600 milligrams of potassium every day now if we compare this to what our bodies really need okay let average person actually needs less than what they about 2300 milligrams okay and they they milligrams of sodium every single day now potassium they need 4700 which is a lot more than what they actually get so an average person is in the negative with potassium by 2100 milligrams and only five percent of the population even gets 4 700 milligrams of potassium every single day so the ratios are just way more important than these individual numbers so for example if you enough potassium well just make sure you don consume more sodium make sure that you least twice as much or even three times as much potassium as the sodium now there i will put those links down below but especially for the cardiovascular system you need these ratios to be correct and this is the exact reason i came up with my electrolyte powder very heavy in the potassium low on the sodium to help correct this imbalance now here okay number one you out your sodium to potassium ratios because an average person like i said is heavy on the sodium and the low on the potassium so when they they sodium than potassium so just by sweating you can correct this in balance right here and support a healthy cardiovascular system all right number two you can release certain toxins the ones that are in your blood just realize that you the good stuff as well but you will release some toxins if they blood number three you better people notice when they sweat especially when they exercise they sleep better that night now it could be the exercise that helps them sleep but just the fact that you balancing these ratios right here are going to help the cardiovascular system you circulation and you will sleep better all right number four more energy now this really depends because if you get more sleep you more energy right if you have an imbalance of sodium and potassium okay and you balance that out you have more energy but if you too many electrolytes especially sodium okay you you sweat and you don sodium you may have more fatigue however this all depends on the quantity of exercise and if you electrolytes at the same time number five it can actually increase your circulation and prevent overheating now just think about this as you you certain fluids right it for your skin it because we hopefully you versus inactivity no sweating when your fluids are not circulating through the body they to get less circulation all right number six sweating creates a harmonic effect what does that mean it means that it creates a certain stress that causes your body to adapt and actually become stronger especially for the neurons in your brain and there found that i that shows that sweating actually helps to maintain your brain cells which is pretty interesting and number seven okay the support of your adrenal glands your adrenal glands have a huge control over sodium and potassium and if you have an imbalance and you sweat you can put these two minerals back into balance and support the adrenals now of course this is also a conditional because if you losing too much potassium that can negatively affect your adrenals but usually the fact that when someone sweats they exercise does support the adrenals as long as you recover but yesterday i cut the lawn and it was hot outside and i sweat like a pig and the sweat was just coming out of my body it was getting in my eyes it was salty and i came inside i took a shower and boy did i feel better the rest of the day and i slept great that night now i think the best next video for you to watch would be the one on exercise the unique benefits of exercise check it out i put it right here you	Success
#1 Remedy for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F30qB2tMQgQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we remedy for chronic fatigue syndrome as well as fibromyalgia now these two symptoms usually come together and if you try to address or treat these two conditions with the wrong treatment it and so if you don the mechanism you end up getting on a remedy or a drug that just makes it worse however most of the data aligns with a virus okay so it usually the epstein-barr virus which is in the herpes family and believe it or not a good percentage of the population has been infected by epstein-barr virus but we infection we infection being reactivated the unique thing about the epstein-barr virus is it goes into a latent or dormant stage and it kind of sits there inactive until you experience stress so it and the alteration in cortisol that reactivates this virus one thing you need to know about cortisol is when you have an increase in cortisol because of stress your immune system becomes paralyzed and one of the best remedies for that is olive leaf extract now what is an olive leaf extract that can help someone with chronic fatigue syndrome well it oloropine and this phytonutrient is the chemical that gives olives its bitter taste in fact you couldn having to remove most of this first or else it would be too bitter and so companies ferment their olives to remove a lot of this phytonutrient so you can consume olives and just as a side note unfortunately most olives that are fermented which have all this friendly bacteria are then pasteurized and so you and killing all these good bacteria so i would highly recommend if you to consume olives to try to find an olive that and it very specific phytonutrient in olive leaves is a very potent antiviral especially for the epstein-barr virus but it also works on the influenza virus and the common cold and other herpes viruses and on top of that it also helps balance cortisol which is involved in the stress response that reactivates the epstein-barr virus but i do want to mention something about olive leaf extract when i recommended it in practice with those people who had fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome it worked very well on people who did things to also reduce their stress those people who couldn get out of that stress situation didn a big change when they took olive leaf extract okay so do whatever you can to get out of this stressful situation and then the olive leaf extract work much better now olive leaf extract also works on a lot of other things most commonly known to help with blood pressure it can help your heart it also has a unique effect on protecting the substantia which is something in your brain that if there could end up with parkinson and lastly this phytonutrient is a potent anti-cancer factor especially for breast cancer and colorectal cancer so anyway if you wanted a good remedy for chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia you may want to try this now one little side note on fibromyalgia if you have it mainly on the right side suspect your gallbladder okay i did a video on this and i put it up right here check it out	Success
The REAL Cause of Your Breathing Problems (Snoring and Sleep Apnea)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MjaUhSOf94	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let breathing problems I sleep apnea I I problems there book which I breath the new science of a lost Arc by James Nester and I agree with most of the data he talks about with a couple things that I disagree but you know I halfway through maybe he talks about that in the second part of the book but if you combine the data in this book with the data uh from Western Price book I think you really good solution for breathing problems he did some really interesting research from all over the world on indigenous cultures and he looked at their teeth because he was a dentist and he found some fascinating data if you compare older cultures who actually ate a lot healthier versus the modern civilized culture that we live in today there okay I mean if you start studying ancient skulls they had their wisdom teeth right nowadays people just remove their wisdom teeth okay why is that well back then they had really good straight teeth good facial bones they had a wider face good bone structure nowadays our face is becoming thinner um people are having nasal septum deviation which they need surgery for um braces are normal I mean it braces why the heck do we need braces why are our teeth so crooked people are having sleep apnea they what is the difference between what we used to do and what we do now well James Nester focuses more on the lack of chewing right nowadays everything is uh soft foods like soups guacamole hummus dips our steak has to be very very tender we don vegetables so we don especially these young kids where the only thing they chew is probably bubblegum so James Nester is focusing on the lack of chewing and Weston Price is focusing more on nutrition because I think they both are the root cause because simply if you look at the indigenous cultures they of Whole Foods they nutritionally dense foods and it trace minerals that activate the proteins that help build our bones as well as the vitamins that activate the minerals that make our bones structurally sound and if you have a nutritional deficiency the actual structure the size of the bones will not fully develop I mean that but if you never chew okay if you constantly being fed soft foods you don bones structurally sound I mean just like the rest of your body I mean if you want to build a strong back you can it without activating the muscles right so you have to do certain exercises to strengthen the muscles to strengthen the bones because they ligaments so as far as the face goes the main muscle is the the articulation in your jaw of chewing and if you chewing enough you activate the muscles around your face and so the real problem boils down to one thing our mouth is too small for our teeth teeth and if there space for the teeth to grow it comes out sideways it comes out forward it comes out back and we don these extra teeth called the wisdom teeth and if our mouth is smaller our Airway passages are also going to be smaller and that is going to restrict our breathing I mean to me it on the way that they deal with these issues I mean they go in there and do surgery they making the Airways more open I mean even if you think about animals in the wild right do they have crooked teeth do they need braces no why because they do a lot of chewing and they eat food that their bodies Were Meant to eat so this is what I recommend first of all get your kids off the refined Foods number one and get them to start chewing Foods uh more now you as an adult watching this can also make a dramatic change on your facial structure which will then lead to helping you breathe better and here you do start to do nose breathing which is a lot better than mouth breathing and you more oxygen number two start chewing your food longer okay now I recommend consuming salad like in large quantities like seven to 10 cups when I tell people that sometimes they freak out they like seven to 10 cups of vegetables that for them so they can I use make greens drink as a substitute and I don for you and then that way you can avoid the the massive effort of chewing your food but I really think you should start chewing your food because if you going to chew seven to 10 cups of salad and just take the time to chew it you will develop your jaw muscles and it not a bad thing to chew other things like steak for example that might not be so tender just spend your time chewing that because what you strengthens your muscles and you remodeling your jaw muscles and your face muscles and that more oxygen because you more of an opening through your mouth I mean you can start eating celery carrots so find things that are true that are also nutrient-dense Foods all right number three and this is based on Western price fat cable vitamins are crucial like vitamin D like vitamin K2 both of those fat CYO vitamins control calcium and you need plenty of calcium in the right places to form teeth in your jaw so in other words don lowfat diet so this includes eggs egg yolk cheese not the lowfat cheese it fatty fish fatty meats and grass-fed butter as well now of course one of the big things is avoiding processed foods refined carbohydrates and then trace minerals trace minerals um are all about activating certain proteins in your body and a lot of people are deficient trace minerals because it Foods anymore because the large Farms are really only putting three minerals back in the soil U NPK right we have nitrogen potassium and phosphorus but what about all the other trace minerals that we need but trace minerals are found in shellfish they Seafood okay and seelp as well so that would be definitely something to put on the list now if you haven video on nose breathing I right here check it out for	Success
The Vitamin Deficiency that Mimics Dementia - Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcTgFlM681E	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we important topic um what was that dementia actually i the number one vitamin deficiency that mimics dementia okay because if you have this idea that you getting dementia or someone you you it could be a simple vitamin deficiency not the actual disease dementia and i will point this out i other videos the worst thing to do is if your spouse friend or family member starts forgetting things they start having confusions or they different mistakes to remind them of that but that cause them to make more and more mistakes or forget things all right what is the most important vitamin uh for the brain okay and if you all sorts of cognitive problems well that would be vitamin b12 b12 is from animal products so if you not consuming animal products you probably are going to be deficient unless you take it as a supplement now i will say that b12 is also made by microbes because i did an evaluation on my wheatgrass juice powder and it was kind of shocking to find out there was b12 in wheatgrass because grass doesn it that made the b12 which is interesting so you can get b12 from certain microbes all right the other cause of a b12 deficiency is that you don in your stomach now that happens as we age it can also happen if you an antacid you need strong hydrochloric acid to be able to absorb b12 so that to be aware of one symptom of low hydrochloric acid is acid reflux okay if that surprises you you should probably watch that video that i did on that topic after you done with this one now one of the cause of a b12 deficiency would be the side effect of metformin all right so when you take metformin you become deficient in not just b12 but vitamin b1 as well now in the studies in b12 when they gave people b12 with people that already had a deficiency in omega-3 fatty acids b12 didn have enough of this omega-3 fatty acid called dha then b12 worked very very well so in other words you need the omega-3 fatty acid to allow b12 to work so you need both of these for brain function another really common cause of dementia are the side effects from medications especially antacids bladder medications for bladder control sleep aids antidepressants medication for anxiety cholesterol medication okay statins blood pressure medications cortical steroids and alcohol so in other words if you get dementia symptoms and you get that medication out and start looking at the side effects it could be as simple as some medication that is causing you to have dementia in fact it imagine not really evaluating these side effects right and then you have dementia and you that that potentially can give you another side effect that you take another medication for i there are so many side effects that are then camouflaged with other medications and there symptom is coming from that unless you come off that medication of course check with your doctor there really important vitamin deficiencies and a mineral deficiency that is related to dementia that you have to be aware of b1 is a very common one especially with the area of the brain that that would be the hippocampus the hippocampus is the part of the brain that memories now they don what it does but they do know when the hippocampus shrinks and has neurodegeneration or atrophy then you get alzheimer deficiency but a b1 deficiency can actually create damage of the hippocampus it can create the same damage as a lack of oxygen hypoxia okay so b1 is very very important it metabolism of the mitochondria that generates energy for the brain so without b1 the nerves cannot work and you literally starve off the fuel for the brain and the number one cause of the b1 deficiency is consuming too much sugar or carbohydrates you see the more carbohydrate that you give the brain to run on the more b1 you you need so the high carb diets increase the demand for b1 and so usually people don enough b1 and so that creates more of a deficiency and now you situation where your hippocampus starts to suffer it starts to break down and then you uh locating things confusion coming up with solution to problems zinc is another key nutrient involved with hippocampus if you have a zinc deficiency you amyloid plaquing in the brain which you see in alzheimer now how do you become zinc deficient probably also because you too much sugar or carbs but also something called phytic acid phytic acid is in the grains it breads it crackers so that phytic acid blocks zinc which can then cause these symptoms right here so zinc is an another important nutrient and then we have vitamin d okay if you most the population is deficient you can go from a mild form of dementia to a severe form of dementia a lot faster so vitamin d slows the process of developing damage in your brain and of course vitamin d comes from the sun it difficult to get it from the food but it liver oil it to a large degree so if you have signs and symptoms of dementia this is what i would recommend okay i would recommend getting on a keto diet immediately okay the healthy version with fasting because out of all the things that you can do running the the brain on ketones would be the best thing you could do because it hippocampus and feed the neurons directly from a different way and actually help slow down this degeneration number two fish fatty fish and seafood okay seafood will give you the zinc it will also give you the omega-3 fatty acids dha but also fatty fish like salmon will also give you both of those nutrients as well as vitamin d red meat for b12 another important thing but if you deficient in b12 red meat will give you all you need now this other thing with the stomach if your stomach acids are not strong enough this is a really good remedy it betaine hydrochloride you want to take like five of these right before you have a meal and that will slowly start building up the acid in the stomach as well as the absorption of b12 so this is a really good plan if you get this symptom of um what is that dementia now if you haven that would be the next video to watch i put it up right here check it

Venous Insufficiency: This is the Most Effective and Safest Remedy for Varicose Veins	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2orzLp9o3pQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you know i wanted to talk about a really good remedy if you have vein problems in your legs but the first thing i want to talk about is what actually is the venous system and how does it differ from the arterial system well veins carry blood from your legs and your fingertips back to the heart so they blood that is deoxygenated without oxygen and what veins is it doesn pumping system it only pumps with motion or movement of muscles so if you lot then you may have more vein problems but we have all these different arteries that go all the way down to your feet and your fingertips and then they go into tiny little capillaries and then the oxygen and nutrition is released into the tissues then it comes back up to the heart through the venous system but you also have a venous system that with your digestion which carries the nutrients from your digestive system back up through the liver and then back to the heart that the hepatic portal system and if there in your liver as in scar tissue cirrhosis or a fatty liver there problem with your veins okay like a backup of pressure into the venous system you can pretty much think about the liver like a sponge right so if the sponge is filled with something that the flow of fluid through it whether it then the sponge can going to be able to hold the fluids it not going to be able to function correctly and it create a backup of pressure if this sponge is connected to some plumbing just like if you had your water filter completely plugged up with a bunch of you know dirt and things it going to back up pressure so in certain parts of your house you a lack of flow and other parts you going to have increased flow and when there system it can create things like varicose veins it can back up veins also in your esophagus that esophageal varices or veins in the lower rectum which is called hemorrhoids or it can affect these veins in your stomach called gastric varices so one big cause of vein problems is the liver but today i want to primarily focus on something called chronic venous insufficiency where you problem mostly in the lower part of your legs where the vein circulation is not moving one term for this is chronic venous insufficiency which then causes varicose veins and spider veins and phlebitis which is inflammation in your veins or even potentially something called deep vein thrombosis where you getting clots in your veins some of the symptoms that are related to a lack of flow in the venous system is number one heavy legs number two swelling in the legs and ankle pain in the legs restlessness in the legs uh the skin is going to be affected so the skin might look shiny or it might give a leathery uh appearance you may lose your hair in your legs it might be itchy or you might have a color change in the lower legs now a lot of women after pregnancy start to develop varicose veins and vein problems in their lower legs and this is related to estrogen so estrogen is another cause of venous problems apparently there this but we do know there for estrogen in your veins and so if you have too much estrogen that can affect the vascular system and this also happens in men too and what happens with women when they get through menopause their estrogen goes down but their progesterone really goes down and so this gives an kind of an appearance of a high estrogen to low progesterone ratio so even though they have low estrogen they have extremely low progesterone so this could be considered as an estrogen dominant situation now in men as they age the testosterone does go down and that amounts of relative estrogen too and especially if their liver is damaged because the liver is a key organ to regulate or buffer this estrogen so that being said the number one best remedy for vein problems in your lower legs is this red vine leaf extract and i found this data in a patent where they had all this additional research and of course this patent was probably based on the huge study they did it was a randomized placebo controlled double-blinded clinical trial on quite a few people who had mild to moderate venous insufficiency now the amount of red vine leaf extract that they used was between 360 to 720 milligrams per day for 12 weeks and the results were significant red vine leaf is also good for enlarged liver and a large spleen swelling in your legs hemorrhoids bruising bleeding nasal congestion capillary thickness and it also helps to balance the permeability within your capillaries the other thing i would recommend is to start doing the rebound exercise simply because that going to start increasing lymph flow and help push some of this fluid through your veins and of course i would definitely recommend doing walking on a regular basis you want to keep active you do not want to do a lot of sitting you don now if there is a liver problem which is very common in these cases the remedy that i would recommend is called tut cup it only good for a fatty liver but it also good for cirrhosis of the liver and tutka will actually increase the flow of bile through the bile ducts now if there is an estrogen dominant problem i would recommend a product called dim which is a super concentrated anti-estrogenic cruciferous blend now since we topic of estrogen in the liver if you haven would be a really good one for you to watch next check it out	Success
You DON'T Have a Slow Metabolism, It's THIS Instead...	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9DB9ICue-Y	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you know there having someone give you the wrong diagnosis they you have a slow metabolism right because you can so when you diagnosis then you the wrong thing because then you going to be focused on trying to find some thing to boost your metabolism well that doesn is not a slow metabolism let me explain so what is metabolism you have all these chemical reactions going in your body whether you building things back up into body tissue like repairing things like maintaining temperature and eliminating waste all that is part of metabolism some people tell you to create a negative caloric condition where you than you then you need to exercise more and then after about six months of doing this you haven basically heat up these calories and burn them okay in a lab to determine how much energy is in a carbohydrate fat and protein but in the body in a biological system things work completely different you have a lot more complexities going on number one you have hormones and that really the missing factor is the hormone influence over your specific calories so hormones are basically the communications in your body and the very important hormone that relates to whether you burn fat or store fat is insulin so the insulin message is store fat if insulin goes up you store fat if insulin goes down it message it so in reality if insulin is too high that is going to mimic a slow metabolism because as soon as you lower it you start to burn fat but if that hormone is just a little too high not only will you not be able to burn fat but the body storage of calories into fat you see this video is all about focusing in on the real problem so then you can have an actual solution to fix it if we know what triggers insulin and how to inhibit it then you will know how to lose weight and you out why that is so different than thinking you have a slow metabolism and you need to speed up your metabolism it just actually will make things worse whether you energy boosters or certain herbs that stimulate your metabolism they end up burning out your metabolism so before i get into the triggers let me just explain what happens when this hormone insulin goes up you going to experience several symptoms okay you hungry more often you carbohydrates you urination especially at night you more belly fat you you because you you well your mood is going to be affected you might feel more grouchy you might have more anxiety and you to have more liver fat and that what abdominal area where you have belly fat you set point okay that weight that you just can to be really stuck if not raised so in other words let these different methods of trying to lose weight and you just can get below 160 or 155 you there well that is called a set point and insulin is really behind the set point the inability to continue to lose weight and there one more really interesting symptom related to this if your insulin is too high you will start or your liver will start making extra sugar not from sugar from your diet but from other things like your own fat and protein that gluco meaning sugar neo meaning new genesis meaning the creation of and you very interesting situation where your insulin has been chronically high for so long you develop this other condition called insulin resistance which means your body has to compensate and make more insulin to create the same effect so you have certain parts of your body where you too much insulin yet other parts of your body where you little insulin and one common thing that you see especially with diabetics that have insulin resistance which they always do is this extra production of sugar from your liver and you usually see it when a person comes off the sugar and then they have high sugars especially in the morning and they coming from well it insulin resistance situation all right so now let different things we triggers insulin and what inhibits insulin if you understand both sides of the coin then you personally can control your own weight okay so what triggers insulin well it okay carbs and definitely sugar okay what inhibits insulin low carbs that right another big trigger to insulin is frequent eating okay like snacking and grazing there more powerful to trigger insulin and stop you losing weight then the small snacks through the day because you constantly triggering insulin all day long and it high insulin that puts you in a situation where you lose weight no matter what so that means one of the things that inhibit insulin is fasting okay intermittent fasting this is why we recommend keto intermittent fasting and that is so powerful to address what you think might be a slow metabolism in reality it insulin problem another thing that will trigger insulin is excessive amounts of protein especially if it fat or no fat protein as in whey protein powder that on the insulin index is pretty darn high now of course that doesn to eating sugar but it that could be a problem all right now on the inhibiting side okay what will keep insulin low and make insulin more sensitive and less resistance is exercise specifically resistance training okay working your whole body at a certain volume and in certain uh intensity uh that insulin resistance and there that will not trigger insulin okay one is fiber natural fiber from things like vegetables now i fake fibers like fiber yum for example which is a synthetic fiber which will definitely increase your insulin i natural fiber from vegetables not the fiber from grains because grains comes with too many carbs but actual really healthy type natural fiber and then we have fat okay fat apparently does not trigger insulin and this is very surprising to people because they been taught that you need to avoid fat with a slow metabolism well guess what they didn metabolism in the first place they had too much insulin and fat is one of the things that doesn interesting now as far as eating fat goes um as long as you keep your carbs low you that good percentage of fat because we keep our carbs really really low and we keep moderate amount of protein all right another trigger for this insulin is stress okay when the stress goes up the cortisol goes up another name for cortisol is glucocorticoids because it controls glucose to a certain degree and it will turn your proteins even your body tissue into glucose one of the side effects of high levels of sustained cortisol output is diabetes because you protein into glucose and it from the dietary sugars it stress so stress can make you fat but it ultimately comes back to the insulin because the cortisol is raising the insulin it cortisol directly it effect now let side okay there can inhibit insulin and make insulin more sensitive and less resistant that would be potassium vitamin b1 and vitamin d okay all three of those can greatly help you lower this insulin resistance situation now another thing that can make insulin more sensitive is apple cider vinegar okay take a tablespoon put some water drink that that will really help your blood sugars and then when you actually end up getting into fat burning that itself can increase insulin sensitivity and then there you have to be aware of if you want to keep insulin lower because these three things will trigger insulin number one inflammation okay inflammation that comes from omega-6 fatty acids like the so-called vegetable oils the corn oil the soy oil the canola those are very inflammatory then you also have belly fat in general visceral fat actually increases inflammation and that alone could actually increase insulin msg monosodium glutamate has the potential to increase insulin it lot of foods especially in restaurant foods and a lack of sleep can also mess up your blood sugars and increase insulin this is why people lose more weight if they have a good night rest all right now you have the secret to bust through this plateau and overcome what you thought was a metabolism problem in reality it was really an insulin problem and on that note if you want more information about insulin resistance i put up this video right here check it out you	Success
The DEADLIEST Bacteria in the World - Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtRodM1INXE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so the question is what is the most deadly bacterial disease in the world well it is the mycobacterium tuberculosis which causes the disease tuberculosis or tb now tuberculosis is very very interesting i had no idea it killed 1 million 800 000 people every single year worldwide that is incredible but what incredible is i found out that 25 of the population has been infected with tb but not in its active form okay in its dormant or latent form so there forms of tb you have the active infection and then you have like an infection that called latent and it kind of sits there and it doesn symptoms at all and it infectious you can dormant or when it what you need to know not a large percent of tb is active okay like ninety percent is latent and only five to ten percent becomes active but the problem with this is that 50 of people with an active infection that are not treated actually die so it is very very deadly but my question of course is what about the other 50 why do they live what do they have special about them that helps them survive well it couldn information on you see what missing when you deal with infections is your own immune system that seems to be neglected and instead we focus more on the antibiotics and other treatments which i that have an active tb infection they usually have a chronic cough and they might have some mucus that has some blood in it they have a fever they get back pain they lose weight they might have night sweats and they might just have these mild symptoms for months and another unique thing about tb is that apparently it takes eight to ten weeks before it even shows up on a test so you might be infected but not really know it for weeks now a big problem with the treatment of tb is you antibiotics for months and months and months and the problem is that you might be at risk for getting antibiotic resistance okay like 13 of the people who get treated become resistant to the antibiotic and then it doesn going to do and apparently six percent of population is resistant to any treatment you do for tb so i want to share something interesting about these antibiotics there number one antibiotics do not do anything for viral infections okay they don fungal or yeast or candida infections and 60 of all antibiotic treatments have been shown to be unnecessary because a lot of these infections were viral or fungal or yeast infections and a really big complication of this is antibiotic resistance because then you start developing these super bugs i mean the same exact thing is happening in agriculture when you these microbes in the soil you start to get super bugs and then now you have a problem with these pathogens that are very very difficult to kill and just as an important side note if you ever take an antibiotic always take a probiotic at the exact same time okay and then afterwards you don you antibiotics and if you not going to interfere with the effectiveness of the antibiotic okay it because you you probiotics that means you friendly microbes and when people have antibiotic resistance they secondary infection and that going to be like a yeast infection a candida infection that this overgrowth you see the bacteria are there to keep the yeast in check and so as soon as you wipe them out you get this overgrowth and that creates a whole series of issues another really major side effect of antibiotics is brain side effects i talking about cognitive loss of memory uh brain fog confusion psychosis major depression anxiety irritability so you and cognitive changes now there something else that about tb that i want to share with you i talked about the active form in the latent form and usually if someone going to get the active form of tb it going to be within one to three years however they could get it later in life okay but the percentage of you getting it becomes less and less so what would increase your risk of getting it down the road well if you live in the northern hemisphere you risk during the winter months so what common about these two items right here and if you guessed low vitamin d you are correct because vitamin d deficiencies increase your risk of in the active form of tb by five times and so there between vitamin d and tb and that d is the most important vitamin for your immune system it affects almost every part of your immune system and it helps to regulate the immune system and if you you tb but a lot of other infections and now also i found some interesting information about the vitamin d receptor okay there vitamin d called polymorphism where the receptor for vitamin d just won kind of resistant okay and so if you have this genetic defect you getting tb and more and more people are getting assessments for their dna and there can find from that by the way various weaknesses that you can then strengthen epigenetically also people that have post traumatic stress syndrome are more likely to get tb why because it activates cortisol so stress activates cortisol which not only lowers your vitamin d but cortisol in general paralyzes your immune system this is why so many people develop autoimmune conditions and all sorts of weird strange illnesses right after major stress events especially losses now a couple other things that will increase the risk of this infection age as you get older of course as you get older your vitamin d goes down and your immune system goes down chemotherapy destroys the immune system so that can also kick in an episode of active tb and then we have steroids what so steroids generally you know they anti-inflammatory but they put your immune system into a sleep mode and this comes back to why vitamin d is the most important vitamin for your immune system and also why you need to be out in the sun a lot more get sun exposure not to the point of getting burned but just before that okay sun is very very healthy not just for the vitamin d but for the infrared and even the uv spectrum is actually good for certain things as well because uv can actually deactivate certain pollutants in the air as well as as well as microbes as a maintenance dosage i would recommend about 10 000 ius of vitamin d3 and in addition to that if you have tb or you that up to about 30 to 40 000 iu period of time now if you haven my video on the relationship between the sun and your immune system i put that right here check it out you	Success
The Vitamin Deficiency behind TIRED and STRAINED EYES	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaPyMljE-pk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let deficiency behind tired eyes now you may automatically think it screen which is possibly true but there tired eyes this deficiency can also create strain eyes it can actually make your eyes sensitive to light it can cause a burning feeling in your eyes make your eyes very irritated feeling like there the when there eyes water now I had this problem when I was in my late 20s I wish I would have known what it was because it was driving me crazy it created a dryness in my eye which then created cracking in my cornea and I had all sorts of eye problems but this deficiency can create bloodshot eyes and eventually cataracts in fact they treat corneal thinning with this nutrient but what happen when you deficient in this nutrient the cornea it the surface of your eye um starts to become abnormal specifically the blood vessels in that layer well can you take a guess what this deficiency is if you guess vitamin B2 you are correct if you B2 you also may feel like your throat is sore or experience cracking in your lips especially in the corners and even a red tongue now in past videos I talked about uh cracked corners of the mouth being a vitamin B3 deficiency and a B2 deficiency because vitamin B2 actually helps vitamin B3 convert from tryptophan into the active form of B3 so both of these vitamins could be involved and also vitamin B2 allows for the conversion of vitamin B6 from the inactive form to the active form so if you know anything about vitamin B6 as well as B3 they very important vitamins and they dependent on vitamin B2 you can also experience uh like migraines or or even headaches behind the eyes if you deficient in B2 well where do you get B2 it meat eggs and Fish and Chicken and milk products like cheese it certain degree but not as much as these products right here you can also get it in nutritional yeast and even brewers yeast and some of your microbes actually make it and the other question is how do you become deficient well if your microbes make B2 and you take antibiotics that could be one reason another reason is you consume refined grains which I lived on all the way up until it especially refined wheat and this is why in certain countries they fortify grains or at least refined grains with some of these B vitamins but of course they synthetic also if you refined corn products you know corn chips corn tortillas um that can create a deficiency of B2 not to mention other vitamins as well sometimes you deficient in B2 if you you mitochondria needs B2 and if you use up your B2 reserve and if you don have enough you can experience that another situation would be hypothyroidism okay and then of course alcohol that of sugar so if you example you may be deficient just because there and in the metabolism of sugar you need B2 as one of the enzymes as well as B1 also if you you can use more B2 all right I given you the secret of how to fix your tired eyes and of course the blue light from the LED you know computer screens is a huge Factor now the next most appropriate video would be on a topic called uh EMF electromagnetic fields check it out I put it right here	Success
The REAL Reason Why Your Arteries are Calcifying and Turning into Bone	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_i7sNQTFPE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today i reason why your arteries are calcifying and potentially turning into bone now since heart disease is the number one killer worldwide i think it important to discuss a nutritional aspect of this problem that gives you something you can do about it and this video is primarily going to talk about the calcium part of this problem more than cholesterol or other problems with the heart what are the top warning signs that someone can get with a heart attack well number one you especially if you exerting yourself or going through emotional stress and the chest pain is relieved when you rest that is a really good indicator that there could be a heart problem and then we have referred pain to your left shoulder or arm okay or even your back or the jaw or this side of your head since the heart is slightly on the left side it can refer to that area right here all right number three heartburn without really having heartburn okay so you could have just a burning feeling in your chest that has nothing to do with acid number four shortness of breath especially exercise or climbing stairs and number five there is no symptoms you just drop dead of a heart attack now the big problem with calcium is the hardening of the arteries and now we lose the elasticity we don have the ability to adapt to stress blood pressure etc it just becomes hardened and that puts a huge stress on the entire body now what interesting about calcium in the arteries is it you just don in the arteries for no reason it active thing that occurs in certain conditions now as far as the type of calcium in the arteries they are finding that it same type of calcium that is in your bone hydroxyapatite in fact this type of calcium makes up 70 of the calcium in your bone and the vascular system is the second most calcified tissue in the body uh excluding your bones okay now we do know as people age their body starts to calcify okay so they start having calcium deposits in their joints of course in the arteries in their eyes in their tissues all over and so this video that you watching is a very important video to understand the mechanism and what you can do about it but we do want to keep the bones calcified and we want to keep the other tissues not calcified now like i mentioned we don becoming bone and a really good test to do to determine if you have calcium in your arteries is a cac score stands for coronary artery calcification score okay i had it done you want the results to be zero no calcium in the arteries that puts you at a very very low risk of heart attacks and mortality so the cac test is not only one of the best predictors of whether or not you heart attack it mortality in general because calcification in your tissues is a pathological sign that there something seriously wrong with your health now the other point i want to bring up is the majority of people over six years old have some type of calcium building up in the arteries which again like i said it should not be there now i want to cover something about bone tissue in your bones you have two types of cells you have the osteoblast and then you have the osteoclast and the osteoblasts are the bone cells that are building bone okay they building bone up and they bone and then we have the osteoclast which actually degrades or breaks down bone so we have these two things happening in the bone at all times right so if you have too much of this you get osteoporosis and then if you have too much of this in your arteries especially you start getting calcification in your bones your your arteries actually are turning into bone which is just it about inside your arteries we about the endothelium which is the inner tissue of your arteries there cells okay in this layer of your artery that are osteogenic what does that mean osteogenic it means that they of producing bone and so a stem cell is an undifferentiated cell it like a blank slate that has the potential to turn into a certain cell depending on what the body needs so when someone starts developing bone tissue in their arteries that is a big problem in the differentiation of what this stem cell should turn into now if we take a look at autoimmune diseases we have the same problem we have a differentiation problem your immune system is unable to differentiate between a normal cell and a pathogen it ends up attacking your own cells and so with this problem it similar it well guess what vitamin k2 is a vitamin that was recently discovered now when i say discovered i mean that it there all this time we just did not recognize it and vitamin k2 is involved in this differentiation problem if you have sufficient vitamin k2 in your body you calcification problem you inhibit the osteoblast the cell that forms bone in the wrong place so vitamin k2 is a potent stimulator of a certain protein called matrix gela protein and this protein inhibits vascular mineralization and is dependent on k2 so if you don have k2 this protein is not going to inhibit vascular mineralization or calcification vitamin k2 is becoming more and more popular there research papers on vitamin k2 that you can look up and so vitamin k2 is all about keeping calcium out of the arteries and keeping calcium in the bone and making your bones very very strong now i believe that the majority of the population is deficient in vitamin k2 at least subclinically okay and i to tell you why in the next section all right why are we deficient in vitamin k2 well what made by bacteria okay it vitamin k1 which actually comes from leafy greens and so vitamin k2 is made by bacteria in fact even in your gut you can convert vitamin k1 to k2 okay if you have the right microbes so if you have gut problems okay and you don right microbes you can conversion that as an absorption problem vitamin k2 is a fat soluble vitamin which means it dependent on bile okay which is produced by the liver and if your liver is fatty which you can pretty much tell if you have a fatty liver if you have a belly okay if you have belly fat you have a fatty liver the more damage to the liver the less bile you less k2 you don congested gallbladder if you have gallbladder problems if you have a bile deficiency you will also have a problem absorbing vitamin k2 if you have inflammation in your gut if you have gastric bypass surgery or some type of problem with your gut that can inhibit your absorption of k 2. also if you don foods you could be deficient in k2 because certain microbes in the fermentation process can actually make vitamin k2 so let me give you some examples we have nato which is a fermented soybeans i think it popular in the east um not in the west sauerkraut has k2 okay you know what that is cheese is a fermented product raw cheese especially if it cheeses or soft cheeses from europe because usually they have raw milk cheese you good amount of vitamin k2 if you actually can get raw butter okay and grass-fed butter you have a good amount of vitamin k2 and guess what butter is a fermented product okay and then of course we have kefir which is one level above yogurt if that from grass-fed animals you have a good amount of k2 of course if you conventional kefir that is pasteurized and sweetened you probably not going to get very much k2 now vitamin k2 is also in egg yolks it beef liver especially if it it sausage it if you you might be omitting these right here and what a while guess what mainstream recommends for cardiovascular disease okay if you guessed a low-fat diet you are correct what do they recommend they recommend fruits vegetables grains at least half whole grains and half refined grains and they even allow a good amount of added sugars to that diet and so this is just another one of those examples of finding out what they are telling you to do or what mainstream is telling you to do and do the complete opposite i mean even take a look at statin drugs right satin drugs inhibit vitamin k2 and i to back that up now as far as the type of vitamin k2 there types one type in these foods right here is mk4 but if you get mk4 and supplement they make it synthetically i recommend the natural form of vitamin k2 which is mk7 and i also recommend taking it with vitamin d okay now as far as the ratios go if you vitamin d3 you would take 100 micrograms of vitamin k2 one last point about vitamin d that actually quite interesting some people are concerned about the toxicity levels of vitamin d3 right well really the only side effect from taking very large amounts of vitamin d3 i several hundred thousand ius of vitamin d3 over a month okay the only major complication is hypercalcemia that means too much calcium in the blood well guess what vitamin k2 does it helps to keep the calcium out of the arteries and in the bone that them together and on that note i think you might find it interesting in this next video on vitamin d toxicity check it out	Success
7 Warning Signs of an IODINE Deficiency	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpWO3nvWvJ0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now there are seven warning signs of an iodine deficiency you may be familiar with a thyroid problem if you iodine you can actually create a hypothyroid condition and the various signs and symptoms of that would be hair loss thinning of the hair lethargy depression dry hair dry skin as well as weight gain and cold intolerance you do not tolerate cold and by the way like in the us alone there hypothyroidism in europe it people and just so you know 90 of all hypothyroidism is more autoimmune and so it may not be an iodine deficiency however iodine deficiency in general is very very common 1.88 billion people on this planet have an iodine deficiency so it people one of the best ways to know for sure if you are low on iodine i you put a little drop of iodine on your skin and you see if it gets absorbed but if you really wanted to do an accurate test to find out if you have an iodine deficiency you stimulating hormone because that really good indicator to know what the pituitary and your thyroid simply because the thyroid is an iodine hog so it iodine and so if there thyroid hormones you won feedback loop to turn off the thyroid so the pituitary just keeps putting out more thyroid stimulating hormones so it really good indication to know if you really deficient in iodine and relating to that as far as the numbers go you want it to be under four but some institutions are bringing that number lower like 2.5 there interesting data on that that might be true but in this video i want to talk mainly about the symptoms that you may not be aware of that are related to an iodine deficiency okay number one intellectual disability that diminishes greatly when you don iodine in adults and in children in fact if you could go down by 15 points if a child is deficient it can go down by 13 points if you add to this an iron deficiency in a child that can bring it another seven points lowered so you lowered iq from a simple mineral deficiency and not just a mineral it trace mineral and what to me is that we only need these tiny tiny trace amounts of this mineral and if you not tiny they are huge so this really involves your ability to solve problems your advancement in your job and it can relate to your future success number two infertility now if you take a look at the body purpose its purpose is to survive reproduce and continue okay and so this little symptom of infertility is not so little it a huge symptom for the body in its purpose to reproduce and so there huge importance in this connection between having this little trace mineral and having the ability to reproduce if an infant is deficient okay in iodine or if a mother is deficient while she carrying a baby the child is very very vulnerable to developing hearing loss because out of all the parts of the brain okay the part of the brain that needs the most oxygen the most metabolism and the most iodine which they connected is the auditory centers and so if a mother is deficient in this one trace mineral the child can end up not being able to hear or having hearing deficiencies and before fibrocystic breast now why would an iodine deficiency show up in the breast well because iodine has a very big importance of regulating excess amount of estrogen and when you have too much estrogen and not enough iodine you can develop like these mini little cysts either in the breast tissue or in the ovary and as a side note if you have fibrocystic breast you should be taking iodine as a supplement and it works very effectively all right number five heavy periods now why would you have the heavy period well because you dominant and iodine can help regulate that and it can help regulate your periods and as a side note too this doesn say about 50 of the time it can also help hot flashes all right number six and this is interesting having a deficiency of iodine can reduce your productivity your ability to achieve something in children and adults and i know what you this probably explains a lot of things that nowadays with a certain percent of the population but iodine can help people increase their ability to get things done all right number seven brain damage now now wait a second an iodine deficiency causing brain damage i thought you have to have physical trauma to cause brain damage well guess what if you don things occur because iodine is essential for certain enzymes that not just create brain tissue but also repair brain tissue and if you brain damage in fact it cause of brain damage in children fascinating now i know you well what foods are in iodine what causes an iodine deficiency i but i will just touch on it briefly the number one cause of iodine deficiency is not necessarily related to not getting enough iodine from your diet okay i want to primarily focus on number three goitrogen foods these are foods that can cause a goiter which is swelling of your thyroid usually because of an iodine deficiency so what be getting enough dietary iodine but consuming these foods at the same time and end up with an iodine deficiency and creating a lot of problems so this point right right here number three goitrogen foods is the most important information okay and out of these foods that can deplete iodine cassava is the number one that has the ability to block iodine why because in addition to its ability to bind to iodine and lock it up it also has two additional chemicals that can also bind in a potent way to iodine hydrocyanic acid which then turns into this theocyanate which is a very strong and potent binder to iodine so because of these two chemicals right here it is not good to consume a lot of cassava simply because it can block iodine so unless you of iodine okay you be deficient there is certain parts of the world that consume a lot of cassava in their diet and this is one of the reasons why large populations are deficient in iodine now you also have soy and corn and canola okay which also block iodine and take a while to guess what they feed animals okay soy corn and sometimes canola but if you actually feed animals this food you can actually create deficiencies in the animals so here you are thinking well you know i don consume corn i don i animals that live off these foods now also cruciferous foods that would be the cabbage the broccoli the brussels sprouts things like that now i videos on this and there want to make on it if you cooking these foods as in the cauliflower or steaming the broccoli or cooking the cabbage it greatly reduce the effect of binding to iodine also you would have to consume a lot of cruciferous to create a deficiency so this is not at the top of the list okay now peanuts and pine nuts also can bind with iodine in large amounts they are not the strongest foods that will do it but i wanted to put it on the list and you also have millet and rice that can also bind with iodine so this is why there deficient in iodine in india south east asia south america as well as africa so what are the best foods for iodine the number one best food for iodine especially if someone would be shellfish okay then fish anything out of the sea okay like seek help that would be good you also have eggs have iodine organ meats have iodine nuts have a moderate amount of iodine but believe it or not vegetables and fruits are not high in the list with iodine so if someone consuming soy corn millet other grains with cassava vegetables fruit and no animal products no eggs no cheese they can easily end up with an iodine deficiency now this is an interesting topic but this next video is even more interesting it reasons why you are deficient in iodine that go even beyond what i just talked about check it out i put it right here	Success
Iodine Deficiency: Seven Reasons Why You Might Be Deficient in Iodine	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbujH5aFOh0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I reasons for an iodine deficiency now the reason I said surprising is because you may have already known that if the soils don poor in trace minerals you end up with a iodine deficiency now that getting food more Inland from the ocean since iodine is normally from ocean food if you from the Midwest chances are it going to have iodine not to mention the farming methods where they that pottassium they don minerals back in the soil unfortunately so if it the plant if it not in the animals so poor soils is number one and also dietary you you don you never consume crab Lobster you don consume uh clams or muscles and also you don nor seaweed as in seelp and so typically I think most people know about this one and this one but they definitely don know about this one right here number one selenium deficiency if you deficient in selenium you deficient in iodine and both selenium and iodine do work on the thyroid um selenium is very important in the conversion from T4 to T3 the active form of the thyroid hormone and iodine is there to actually be a part of the the molecule which is like T4 T3 what T3 and T4 represent is the number of Iodine molecules attached to that hormone a brazilnut has a good amount of selenium number two radiation okay so if you exposed to radiation um there something called iodine 131 which is radioactive and that can Lodge right into the thyroid thyroid receptors and so there is a remedy or shall I say a preventative measure that you can do if you are exposed or know that you going to be exposed to radiation okay and that is pottassium iodide you don you can get another brand but you should probably have it around your house just in case there is some type of radiation problem because if you take it between 24 hours before exposure or up to 4 hours after exposure you can protect your thyroid from the radioactive iodine that is in the environment it food it recommend taking potassium iodide as a general supplement and so you really only want to take it when you need it so you can just store it away and so if you happen to need it at some point it available because I will guarantee if there is some type of threat of um some type of radiation problem you won able to find it because everyone to buy it up real quick all right number three goitrogen foods these are foods that have certain things in them that have the potential to deplete iodine and cause a goer okay which is an an large thyroid gland okay the thyroid gland swells up what out of all the things that can do that cassava is at the top of the list not only because it binds iodine directly but because it also has two additional chemicals that can potently block iodine okay these two chemicals right here and unfortunately there are certain populations certain groups around the world that consume a lot of cassava and even if you diet from seafood or fish if you consuming a lot of this you can end up being deficient in fact it billion people worldwide are deficient in iodine all right another set of foods would be soy corn and canola okay there consuming soy corn and canola in fact probably the entire world is consuming soy in corn not to mention being fed to the animals and so if you get iodine from animals if they consuming a lot of this it somewhat difficult because it be deficient cruciferous vegetables okay now I have videos just on this one topic and there are a lot of health benefits from taking cruciferous vegetables okay cruciferous vegetables have a mild effect on binding iodine it strong as cassaba and it not as strong as these two but also when you steam or cook cruciferous vegetables that will reduce this effect right here also if you amount of iodine and you consuming cerous it the reason why you iodine you probably would only be deficient if you consumed large amounts of cruciferous with no Seafood no fish no seelp and also other foods that might have iodine now just on that note you might consume a lot of vegetables and fruits right well guess what vegetables and fruits are low in iodine okay eggs are a good source of iodine and meats and nuts will give you like a moderate amount of iodine so the best source of iodine is seafood like shellfish things like that very high iodine and also fish from the sea as well as seelp now seelp is a vegetable in the sea but I talking about vegetables on land okay that vegetables on land do not have a lot of iodine now there is also some iodine binding effects from peanuts and pine nuts and Millet and definitely rice okay rice soy and corn in cassava are at the top of the list this is why we have an Iden efficiency in parts of India southeast Asia South America and Africa this right here because even though you these uh things can actually uh make you deficient all right number four bromine okay now what is bromine well it chemical that they put into um certain breads okay and um it okay and it okay so this can block your iodine okay and then you have fluide both of these are in the same family and elements but fluoride also can block iodine now you probably well I myself to fluoride okay well do you ever get your teeth whitened well do you ever take a shower do you ever drink your water without a filter City water has fluoride in it right and so you can expose yourself your skin to it it can be absorbed or you can drink it so it very important to have a filter that can filter this out as well as number five perchlorate what is perchlorate it chemical they put in city water that uh kills bacteria and it has the effect of blocking iodine and this is another reason why you need a filter on your house a water filter both on the shower and uh on the sink all right number six oral contraceptives okay how many women are on birth control pills right that going to block iodine as well as certain medications and there in cigarette smoke that can block iodine is as well so if you consuming a lot of these Foods right here and being exposed to this and this chances are you could be deficient in iodine the other thing about iodine is that your body doesn mechanism to prevent excretion of iodine so it gets stored to some degree but it doesn your body uses up a lot of this iodine so it your body can actually slow down and regulate the release of it and you can go through it pretty quickly now that you know the reasons why you might be deficient and iodine let the unusual symptoms that you might get if you right here	Success
4 Mineral Deficiencies That LOWER Your IQ (Intelligence)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKb0HNov1Vw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	there are at least four mineral deficiencies that can significantly affect your IQ that today generally speaking it intelligence it problems it understand certain things there memory or recall component to it and some people say well you know what your intelligence is really finite and either you absolutely not true okay you can have training you can do self-improvement you can do a lot of things and even what your mother ate while she a a factor on your intelligence and your future ability to solve problems as you other factors too like with learning it could be that you were in school and no one ever taught you how to study or learn and I because they don study or learn you know that so you go in there and you sort of memorize you reread you rewrite things over and over and hopefully somehow you pass the test and you get through it but today I want to really focus in on the nutrient part of your intelligence so probably one of the most influential trace minerals which you don little bit of it and if you don that little bit you big trouble because if you in iine as a child your IQ can go down significantly like 13 points okay now even if you there are certain studies that show that it can decrease by 15 points and that pretty significant but the crucial time to get iodine is when the woman is pregnant with that baby as well as when they and so iodine is involved in the creation of your brain and of certain parts of the brain like the hippocampus which is involved with learning memory being able to navigate yourself through different things so primarily we have the hippocampus and then the frontal lobe involved in problem solving but of course how much of these parts of the brain are involved with problem solving in IQ I mean it remarkable some people have had huge amounts of trauma and damage to their brains I mean destruction of a good portion of the brain and they still seem to maintain their cognitive function and their IQ so I just wanted to point that out because we really don much brain we really need apparently we have a lot of extra now the second mineral that is the most important is zinc zinc is involved in hundreds of different enzyme reactions okay it definitely involved with the hippocampus it neurotransmitters and if you zinc your IQ is going down but this zinc correlates with copper they both work together so you need this zinc to Copper ratio and when you have children that have autism for example there always extremely low zinc and copper levels but there between high IQ and good zinc to Copper ratios copper is also very low in Alzheimer concentrated in a structure in your brain stem called the locus cilus which has everything to do with your sleeping and then we have magnesium magnesium is needed for making ATP it energy in the brain and if you don have enough magnesium there is a huge correlation between a lower IQ and so if we look at this right here we have you know Seafood shellfish okay and magnesium salad vegetables leafy greens but you can also get it in nuts and other Foods as well but Seafood shell very important to get the top three I wanted to add a few more vitamin D deficiency is also correlated with learning dis disabilities lower IQ and cognitive function so here that you are pregnant now iron also correlates with a lower IQ probably because it red blood cells and carry oxygen to your brain now there I really need to cover related to this cognitive function and that has to do with this thing called Sugar Sugar actually makes you stupid it definitely correlates with a lower IQ now that being said I do want to make a very important point just because someone has a high IQ just because someone is so-called intelligent doesn mean that they are sane okay they could be very intelligent but be in completely insane and when I talk about insane I talking about destructive right but when we about blood sugar we even diabetes so if your A1C is like above seven your recall is goes down okay your ability to recall memories is significantly affected diabetics on average have a lower IQ by 7.84 points when someone is a diabetic and they have higher sugar in their blood that shrinks the hippocampus so we have less hippocampus to work with which means less capacity for memory less capacity for Learning and that is intimately connected with IQ now if we take a look at the brain um that has insulin resistance okay it brain insulin resistance which is always the case for someone that has high sugar like a diabetic there is a lot of destruction going on in the neurons okay and so when you feed the brain cells the neurons too much sugar you end up destroying those synapses and thank goodness there bypass that whole thing and get the energy that the neurons need so you can have more intelligence and that alternative fuel is ketones now what interesting about ketones is that your brain is the organ that does not have to adapt to ketones like other parts of the body in other words there of three days where you have to adapt or convert over to ketones it can use ketones immediately if it there in the brain the brain does not store glycogen why because there because when you have to store a lot of water and there just no space so the brain is dependent for its energy from the blood okay and then that usually comes from your liver primarily so if your liver that can affect the brain but if the brain has a choice between ketones or glucose it will always pick ketones as a primary Fuel and that way even if there cells can get energy so in other words your brain is very vulnerable to what diet you are on and really what determines if there blood or not is really two things glucose and your insulin levels so when a person starts to go on the ketogenic diet and they start lowering their glucose uh they notice also their insulin levels lower they may still have problems and they may not notice the significant benefits of ketosis for quite some time primarily because there of insulin in their blood at all times and if someone is obese they usually have like three times the insulin levels and this really has nothing to do with their diet it insulin is just a lot higher than someone that doesn problem so if you are watching and you you lose weight the more the insulin levels decrease the more the benefits and it could take some time so what are the takeaways from this video shellfish Seafood big salads and cut the sugar out and go on a low carb diet now there lot more to talk about the brain if you haven health this would be a very interesting one to watch next	Success
The 10 Causes of Exhaustion (Fatigue)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED34EEXVjYg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let be exhausted and i have a lot of personal experience i was being exhausted a good portion of my life and i had no idea back then but i experiences with you in this video the first and most important thing to do when you have exhaustion is just to you know kind of go back in your mind and isolate when it started and then take a look at what happened just before that to get a clue was it diet related was it stress related was there some medication you got on and then then you that very few people do actually but let medications have side effects there are so many people out there right now on medications that are tired that are not connecting the dots in fact i don know of one medication that doesn you fatigue or lethargy or some type of lowered energy as a side effect okay they all cause you to be tired because they inhibit or stimulate um neurotransmitters which are kind of like hormone little communications in your nervous system so especially if you in antidepressants or anti-anxiety medication or high blood pressure medication those definitely will make you tired so find another solution i telling you to come off your medication but get with your doctor and see if you can do something more natural because if you gives you another problem it number two fuel the fuel that you body on is the wrong fuel you your body on sugar this applies to those that are new to my channel if you you already know this but burning fat fuel gives you a lot of energy burning sugar fuel will make you roller coaster with your energy and that was me in my 20s i was so exhausted i had no connection it was related to my diet as i was eating cereal and muffins and orange juice in the morning avoiding the saturated fat pure carbs and i had no connection i would in fact my wife and i would be driving the street and we health food store honey let there and take some vitamins and come out with all these vitamins in hopes of raising or boosting my energy well that never worked until i finally stumbled across a book called it and in the first chapter i was talking about insulin and carbohydrates and i miss this in college and i started to consume more protein eggs and i carbs and oh my gosh did my energy come back fast and then i got really interested in the subject and doing massive deep dive in research and here i am okay and if you want that information what to eat i put the link down below number three poor sleep that sleeping through the night if you are not feeling rejuvenated when you get up then it could be your stress level it could be something you i have probably at least 50 videos on sleep i below but if you in zinc that right there will keep you from sleeping and one little quick tip if you take vitamin d3 and zinc right before bed you may find that you sleep a lot better right off the bat of course you want to change your diet as well all right number four hidden infection this happened with me in high school i had mono okay that epstein-barr virus and so i had this infection it was really bad my tonsils were completely swollen and then later in life when i went through a lot of stress i had chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia that was that epstein-barr virus sitting in the background being reactivated okay being reactivated by a stress state so these viruses tend to go dormant and then come out later in life not as a full-blown infection but as fatigue or achy joints or flu-like symptoms what happened with me is i really dealt with a major stress in my life at that time and ridding the stress caused that virus to go back on emission because stress activates cortisol cortisol paralyzes your immune cells your white blood cells so cortisol will just shut down your immune system the pathogens come out and create a lot of problems so you have to handle this thing right here to handle this another time in my life i got lines i i remember getting really tired just out of the blue for no reason like why am i so exhausted and then i looked in the mirror in my back and there rash i so i started to take the antibiotic and boy i did not feel good on that it felt like my body was like the inside was a wash machine it i stopped that and i started taking um a series of herbal things and i the link down below of what i took and that took care of those symptoms and i got my energy back and i to this day i never had a problem with that okay number five post covid uh fatigue um a lot of people are complaining about this i did a video on it what you need is a lot of vitamin b1 because this infection depletes your b1 and one of the big side effects is a lack of energy because your little energy factories your mitochondria need b1 to create energy so you need a lot of b1 i wouldn i would take a natural version and you will find that your energy goes up people that have gastric bypass surgery they fatigue people that drink a lot of coffee and tea through the day are b1 deficient and then that can cause fatigue and then the need for more caffeine all right number six if you tried the ketogenic diet and you get keto fatigue that that you specifically potassium or b vitamins the best source of b vitamins is nutritional yeast unfortified and of course the best electrolytes are of course my own brand and of course i not biased but here with potassium every single cell has this little these little pumps are called sodium potassium pumps okay and what they do is they generate energy for the nervous system and the muscular system so you need a lot of potassium to run that system because if you and especially if you add keto on top of it the demand for these nutrients does go up which i but just add these two things in here and your fatigue will go away all right number seven you can have anemia and take a while guess what food has really good amounts of b12 and iron red meat that two vitamins doesn simply because they might not be bioavailable right so if you switched over to a plant-based diet or a vegan diet and you start getting anemia maybe that wasn the world but so many people have this subclinical anemia the other reason for anemia is that maybe you are getting these two nutrients but the stomach acid is not strong enough and so what you need is betaine hydrochloride okay simple remedy you take five betaine hydrochloride before you eat and you start acidifying the stomach now how do you know if you need more stomach acid a really good clue would be indigestion acid reflux that those two symptoms or bloating just try some betaine hydrochloride and those symptoms will go away because you might think that wow i need to suppress the acid right no you need to increase the acid so if you are on or were on an acid okay that could be causing you anemia because it depletes the acid in your stomach so that are tired number eight low thyroid can definitely make you tired it could mean that you just need a little bit of iodine or selenium but most hypothyroid situations are autoimmune that where you have a lot of inflammation and that can be causing the fatigue the remedy for a hashimoto problem and all other autoimmune diseases have to do with taking more vitamin d3 and you want to take no less than about 30 000 ius per day okay that is going to help reduce the inflammation and increase your energy i want to mention number nine mycoplasmas what is that that is uh some stealth microbe that is very small bacteria that can hide in little calcium igloos they occur for example i know like in like the gulf war syndrome this is really underneath that and so if you have these hidden infections like oregano oil works good any of the natural herbs like garlic thyme sage and there you can do as a natural way of suppressing this as well as dealing with this the stress here because these guys can kind of come out when your cortisol is too high all right i gave you a lot of information i hope i didn you but i think the most important thing to do now would be to implement a basic eating plan that and that here check it

How to Stop Excessive Sweating (Hyperhidrosis)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EULddsEzGlQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let excessive sweating not just in your hands but your whole body the medical term for this is called hyperhidrosis you have the acronym gland okay you have another gland called the apocrine gland and then you have the third one which is sebaceous gland okay so i very very simple okay just to really kind of navigate through it in a simple way because there now this gland responds with exercise uh nervousness emotional stress uh hot weather and then the april crinkland um responds to emotional stress fear pain and the sebaceous gland different because it this little bit of an oil called sebum for lubrication these two glands are releasing salt and other electrolytes so these two glands are primarily for cooling okay so causing this sweating reaction and then the evaporation of the liquid creating a cooling sensation so these two are really involved with temperature regulation and it this gland right here which is responsible for this excess sweating and it usually emotion and so the body tolerance of stress okay is just lowered little things will trigger it now you may not feel stressed but apparently your body has a very low threshold for stress now what is that the treatment that they do on some of these cases is surgical it sympathectomy okay they literally remove part of your sympathetic nervous system so in sweden this is banned because of the side effects okay i mean removing part of your nervous system is is a bit invasive or they use medications to inhibit uh these neurotransmitter enzymes okay i to keep this real simple the temperature regulation and your your bodies in the brain you can call it the thermostat okay it it studio right now i have the controls and there that detects a certain temperature of 70 degrees so anything that goes too high or too low and that mechanism will either kick in or cool it down or raise the temperature so there little sensor or receptor that picks up temperature that thing same thing in the brain there receptor here that picks up temperature and either turns things off or turns things on so we have this feedback thermostat mechanism going on between your hypothalamus and your skin okay so that that so these medications work by kind of completing this communication and turning off this mechanism so it doesn on and on and on and so surgically they nervous system but the medications work on both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system so really they out this autonomic nervous system but they do target the autonomic nervous system so the question is is there something natural is there something herbal that can be done that mimics this without the side effects because these medications always have side effects and the answer is yes there is okay and the very specific uh phytonutrient that will mimic this medication is called rosemarinic acid which happens to be in rosemary and sage okay so both of these plants have this phytonutrient that can actually help mimic this medication now the next thing that i found related to this topic is vitamin b1 thymine okay there deficiency and that severe b1 deficiency okay if you want to know the name it called wernicke corsicoff that is part of beriberi which is a b1 deficiency one of the side effects of the syndrome is excessive sweating it just so happens thymine is involved heavily in the autonomic nervous system okay it nervous system to work and if you deficient in b1 you can have all sorts of problems with the autonomic nervous system but excessive sweating is one so anytime you have a problem with the sympathetic nervous system which is the flight or fight or even the the parasympathetic you want to use vitamin b1 in sufficient amounts and as an interesting coincidence the herb sage is very rich in vitamin b1 and vitamin b1 as far as what it does in the brain is it works on the limbic system which is intimately involved with your emotions okay so it relay switch involved in emotion and emotional stress and the more emotional stress that a person has the less b1 they requirement for b1 goes up when you experience stress and taking b1 helps to reduce stress but all you need to know right now it system so there are two things i to recommend okay number one if you have this condition excessive sweating okay take this either in the form of rosemary or sage okay and sufficient b1 i would highly recommend finding a natural b1 not this the typical synthetic whatever it says on the directions i would take like four times the amount to see if that can help you all right i hope i explained this in a very simple way i didn far into the woods but the next most interesting video you should watch is on vitamin b1 and i put that video up right here check it out	Success
Think Twice before Getting a Hysterectomy	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzxBOdx3Q68	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now you might want to think twice about getting a hysterectomy of course check with your doctor before taking on that recommendation which that sounds kind of weird but i had to give that disclaimer but i want to talk about the serious consequences and side effects from hysterectomies first thing you need to know is that 90 of all hysterectomies are not life-threatening okay because one of the reasons they do them is cancer but that okay the great majority of hysterectomies are basically unnecessary and you should really know what you it surgery behind c-sections and if someone tells you well you approaching menopause and you really don because they stop working don the ovaries continue to work beyond menopause okay they produce significant amounts of androgens which then can be turned into estrogen and if your doctor disagrees with you just ask them then why do i need hormone replacement therapy after i have a full hysterectomy well it have the ovaries to produce those female hormones anymore okay consequences the side effects of hysterectomy well the big one is going to change your figure in a very negative way because when you cut this band of ligaments that are attached to the uterus those ligaments are also attached to the spine the hips part of your pelvis and basically you internal part of your torso the core of the inside of your mid section that causes the hips to widen that causes the rib cage to shift downward it can also give you a shortened thick midsection appearance and a protruded belly and many times when you hopefully see an informed consent you don number two lower back pain why because you just created a lot of instability in your pelvis not to mention the potential for a leaky bladder and a loss of libido which is number four number five emotional rollercoaster it can really affect your emotions because if there of estrogen or progesterone downward or upward and that can affect your emotional state of mind number six fatigue number seven it can increase your risk of getting fractures because now you potentially get either osteopenia or osteoporosis because of the loss of estrogen number eight it can increase your risk of all-cause mortality including coronary heart disease now sometimes they you that way it can decrease your risk of potentially getting ovarian cancer down the road so you organ to prevent cancer from developing in that organ which by the way ovarian cancer is rare especially if you compare the death from overhang cancer to the increased risk of dying from a hysterectomy this is a much greater risk than getting ovarian cancer and dying from ovarian cancer number nine an average female who has a hysterectomy gains 25 pounds within the first year now instead of getting hysterectomy why don identify the reason for the hysterectomy okay let all right we have fibroids okay we have endometriosis already talked about cancer excessive bleeding or heavy cycles okay what could you do to resolve these that would be a new concept well number one black cohosh is pretty effective for uterine fibroids number two i would highly recommend you avoid soy especially the soy protein isolates in so many different foods and it can affect estrogen sensitive tissue like the uterus like the ovary the cervix and other tissues even the thyroid you don taking extra estrogen or consuming foods that are estrogenic this is why i also recommend if you have fibroids or endometriosis to avoid dairy because dairy is originally designed to help grow a calf so there there so anything that increases growth you want to avoid and there hormones that will do that estrogen will do it and insulin will do it as well so that why going on a low-carb diet would be smart insulin is anabolic it makes things get bigger but so is estrogen so you want to avoid soy dairy and carbs especially the refined carbohydrates of course you can have vegetables as in the cruciferous vegetables cruciferous vegetables are they help balance the estrogen they not going to increase more estrogen they estrogen to the good estrogen but they also detoxify the liver of things that can mimic estrogen as in endocrine disruptors so there are certain things in the environment pesticides insecticides herbicides fungicides heavy metals plastics this is an herbicide glyphosate it all the different gmo foods right these chemicals in the environment are endocrine disruptors but they also mimic estrogen okay so what we want to do is we want to go organic we want to really limit the exposure to chemicals and at the same time consume cruciferous vegetables that can help detoxify these chemicals from your body also there between vitamin d deficiency in fibroids and endometriosis so i would just recommend getting enough vitamin d if you have fibroids endometriosis or even heavy periods because think about it the uterus is a muscle right so it needs calcium it needs magnesium when you take vitamin d what do you do you increase the absorption of calcium and other minerals and what better for a cramp than having more of these minerals the other thing i wanted to mention related to glyphosate it blocks vitamin a and there research i that shows the connection between low vitamin a and developing fibroids okay and i should start taking vitamin a of course you should eat the foods high in vitamin a like butter cod oil egg yolks that would be beneficial but i that might be your situation now one last point let hysterectomy okay is there anything else you can do in addition to what i talked about right here yes there is a really wonderful product from standard process i with them anymore but standard process has a product called utrophin pmg okay eutrophin pmg i would take that i would recommend taking maybe two two of those before you go to bed the second thing i would take if you had your ovaries removed is another product from standard process called ovutrophin pmg okay so overtrophing pmg take one of those before bed and it you symptoms and that goes beyond what i recommended right here now since we hormones there estrogen that i would highly recommend and i put it up right here check it out	Success
#1 Best Remedy for a UTI (Urinary Tract Infection)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfAFYQk-Ek0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	i best remedies for a uti a urinary tract infection let burning upon urination frequent urination the urge to urinate when your bladder is empty and also you might have abdominal pain which is a little lower in your abdomen lower back pain blood in the urine cloudy urine or your urine has a bad odor now as far as the microbe involved 80 of the time it coli utis are five times more common in women than men and that has to do with the location of where your urethra is to the anal area and so as far as anatomy goes you have the two kidneys right here which connect to these two little tubes right here they these tubes drain down into the bladder and then you have an additional tube called the urethra when you have a urinary tract infection you can have an infection here here here or right in there but the e coli tend to want to survive so they to form biofilms in the bladder which is going to make it very difficult to attack because now they go underneath the radar and this is why a lot of people especially women get recurrent utis over and over and over especially the more antibiotics they take because these microbes now become resistant which basically means they morph and they get smarter and they harder to kill and these antibiotics don antibiotics you take the worse things get so this is why you something more natural and one way to diagnose the uti is a simple urine test and you amounts of nitrates and leukocytes which are white blood cells there tests that you can do to confirm it now when people think uti they automatically go to cranberry juice and cranberry supplements that very effective because the cranberry tends to make the bacteria slide off and not stick to the inside of the bladder wall so cranberry in general i think is good for a preventative thing and i about maybe cranberry pills not the juice because there is some sugar in there but typically once you have a uti cranberry juice doesn well okay so what i is something that does work a lot better it capsules as well as thyme capsules okay now both of these are pretty potent herbal natural antibiotics specifically with this natural chemical in both of these plants called carvacrol and when you get the oregano make sure it least 60 percent carvacrol and i would recommend taking at least 200 milligrams at least it could be more four times per day of oregano oil and as far as time try to find something that milligrams and you can take that once a day because this chemical in both of these plants inhibits biofilms it also kills e coli the major microbe that infection i cider vinegar two tablespoons and 16 ounces of water to drop your ph to make your ph more acidic if you less pathogenic microbes the acid tends to inhibit the formation of these microbes the other thing i recommend is to drink at least 2.5 liters of fluid a day and of course you can add that apple cider vinegar to this liquid because the more fluid you have you can actually assist and help fleshing out these microbes as you killing them with these two things right here there would recommend okay taking some natural diuretic that way you can help to increase the flow of urine through these these channels through here asparagus is a really good natural diuretic dandelion greens is another good natural diuretic or potassium citrate as in a lot of electrolytes okay so that will help flush things out very nicely now since we antibiotics okay and oregano oil there some additional information i think you right here check it out	Success
The Quickest Way to Test for Bowel Disease (Crohn's, IBD, UC or SIBO)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgGeX-UxnoA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now there is a super simple very quick test that you can do to figure out if you have bowel disease or gut issues okay which i explain at the end you can fast forward if you want but i recommend that you just hear me out because i have some very important points related to your gut whether you have celiac crohn ulcerative colitis diverticulitis small intestinal bacterial overgrowth when we bowel disease it usually relates to your microbes okay you have trillions of microbes in your gut and there could be some alteration in the amounts or the type of microbes you might have too little good bacteria and too much bad bacteria and so of course people will say well you need to feed your bacteria fiber and this is why they recommend 11 servings of grains right with at least three of those 11 servings being whole grains because of course we all know that fiber feeds the microbes right we want healthy fiber but the confusing part about that is pull grains doesn usually have much fiber like seven percent fiber it a lot of other things like starch but it fiber food it also has phytic acid in it which if you don minerals okay specifically iron zinc calcium magnesium it tightly binds minerals so if anyone were to tell you that well grains are nutrient dense just bring up this point about phytic acid that blocks the nutrition in whole grains but in refined grains there is not hardly any nutrition because they they have to fortify or enrich the grains with some a couple synthetic vitamins and then they can call it a nutrient-dense foods because you adding a couple synthetic vitamins and then we have the protein in grains which is gluten which literally tears up the digestive tract and creates so many problems so even though you may not have a gluten allergy it could be a gluten sensitivity so that so honestly i think the worst thing you could possibly eat for digestive problems is grains now when we talk about fiber in general um people associate you have to eat enough fiber to prevent constipation because we all know for a fact that constipation is just a lack of fiber and if you just take more fiber then you can actually go on a regular basis now there types of fiber out there you have the fiber from the grain you have fiber from salad right that salad has no gluten there amounts of phytic acid except maybe in certain things like spinach that has oxalates and phytic acid it also has a lot of nutrients potassium magnesium folic acid vitamin c so of course salad would be a much better fiber than grains and then you have all these new functional fibers they treats like the soluble corn fiber and the tapioca fiber and the inulin and the chicory root okay with so many people having digestive bloating and gas from these products it so what is happening in the colonies creating all this bloating and gas well you these microbes are attempting to break down some of these fibers and they releasing a lot of methane gas and other gases and all sorts of things that are creating distension and pain in your colon now relating to microbes there categories of microbes you have microbes that are harmful okay to you those are called pathogens you also have microbes that help you okay like friendly bacteria those are called mutualists they have a mutual relationship with you they give you certain benefits and you give them certain benefits you give them a place to live right so there exchange then you have microbes that are kind of neutral they they live in your body they don you they don bother you so here a good amount of the microbes that you have in your gut actually can change morph into the bad guys so in other words you can have a microbe that is neutral that can turn pathogenic because if you think about it where do these bad microbes come from right do they just kind of appear from nowhere no they coming from a condition from being neutral to now being pathogenic or harmful and that definitely applies to like e coli and h pylori and c diff and even candida when the environment of your gut changes these microbes shift their state of beingness their condition and they can start creating trouble for you so when the environment changes like there stress in your gut one stress would be antibiotics right now you say well i don antibiotics did you realize that wheat that grain that you took was sprayed with glyphosate which is an herbicide and classified as an antibiotic in fact the company that created this product also got a patent with a different application so glyphosate is an antibiotic it kills microbes in the soil and it kills microbes in your gut so we can add another one to this list with the phytic acid the gluten and now that considered an antibiotic which is really bizarre to me that they are recommending the majority of your calories should be grains the actual thing that would create so many problems for your gut i mean it course there off the environment you have drugs you have junk food alcohol artificial sweeteners that disrupt your gut i think and i predict down the road we will see these functional fibers like the corn fibers and the tapioca fibers being something that alters the environment for the microbes to turn them from good to bad and so when we issues we do need to recognize and understand that these microbes are very very important they successful in survival they to the harshest conditions they can live at the bottom of the ocean they can live in the clouds they can live in lava i mean it adapted they they depend on them and without them we would not even be alive they our immune system they help make vitamins they help us with digestion and they give a secondary kind of compounds that are beneficial to our health now let the important way to determine if you have gut issues okay here we go step one eliminate all fiber from your diet for three days okay that see how you feel step two add the fiber back into the diet for three days now compare how you felt when you eliminated the fiber versus when you added the fiber and then you really know for sure if you have gut issues it could be inflammation it could be some other type of dysbiosis going on with your gut but that without having to go through a bunch of testing without having to wait for some scientific study without having them to put you under and having a scope go into your intestine simply eliminate your fiber and see if you feel better then you know for sure something is going in your gut and that that now if you add the fiber and you feel better chances are you don and you just now fed the microbes and now they food of course the fiber i recommending is from vegetable fiber like salads but here if you eliminate fiber isn aren because they have no more food well like i said before microbes can adapt to almost any condition they can eat almost any food did you realize that microbes can even live on metal plastics and even your waste so even in a condition called sibo you have these friendly bacteria in your small intestine and what are they eating well they they they eating protein so if your body does not do well on fiber then don fiber and i know in my books and things i recommend seven to ten cups of salad per day but some people can personally when i do that i feel better but i know a lot of people that don feel good when they consume that much fiber even if it not even talking about grains in fact i was puzzled back then when my when i consumed more meat okay and not any more grains of course at that time i wasn consuming any salad my bowels actually did very good and i was very confused at that at the time but over the years i and i can tolerate more vegetable fiber and the main reason i personally consume vegetables is not necessarily just for the fiber it potassium magnesium vitamin c folate things like that just as one last side note related to this topic when you consume fermented food like sauerkraut or kimchi that is way better than fiber so let for a period of time and you want to introduce fiber back into the diet i would recommend introducing fermented fiber as in sauerkraut kimchi things like that now since we of microbes okay another really good video for you to watch would be the one on how microbes are affected when you fast check it out i put it up right here	Success
7 Warning Signs of a SALT Deficiency	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqhThRC2ldQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now i importance of potassium but i have not focused as much on sodium so in this video we talk about the importance of salt in fact i signs that you may be salt deficient and of course the biggest way you get sodium is with just salt so we focusing on salt in this video why would someone be deficient in salt well they don they they have high blood pressure so they don maybe they stress the more stress you go through the more salt you actually need let say it sweating you some professional athletes that are working out hardcore in the summer can lose up to six grams of sodium just in one hour so when we lose a ton of sodium as well as chloride right there lose even more chlorides than we do sodium okay here high amounts of potassium let start taking a potassium electrolyte powder and you just neglect to take sodium or salt right well that to throw you off because anytime you look at salt or especially sodium you want to look at it in a balanced state okay not as an individual mineral because when you increase the opposing mineral that like potassium you can actually increase it or decrease it depending on what you do to potassium for example if someone is salt sensitive what that really means is they the problem if someone doesn they sodium more and more and more and generate all these side effects that i going to talk about what they should do instead is just beef up the other mineral it sufficient amounts of both minerals but in the right ratio but anytime we go up with potassium we need more salt anytime we go up with salt we need more potassium okay you started the ketogenic diet ketones are like diuretics okay you going to lose a lot of water and when you lose the water you your salt and you potassium so you need both of these things to be put back into the body now what about fasting yeah well you eating anything you water you shouldn you consuming sea salt for sure if you are fasting simply because our bodies require as an essential nutrient sodium and chloride or you symptoms which i now if you drink coffee let drink four cups of coffee in a day you because caffeine depletes sodium which is interesting maybe you want to add a little salt in your coffee i reduce some of the bitterness okay drinking too much water i videos just on this topic if you haven this would conflict with what you been taught that we need to drink a lot of water everyone knows this but the question is what happens when we drink too much water well guess what we flush out the electrolytes especially sodium chloride there died by drinking too much water it called hyponatremia because you want to drink when you there amount just make sure you also add the sea salt with it okay so these are the reasons why someone the key is balancing your salt instead of just restricting your salt or adding more salt make sure you add the opposing mineral potassium if you sensitive add potassium what does uh salt do well it regulates your fluids it helps you make hydrochloric acid because sodium chloride makes hydrochloric acid okay so if you heartburn or indigestion especially you might need to beef up your salts okay maintains ph okay the acid alkaline levels it potassium pump which is in every single cell in the body and that is the generator pump for energy for the nerve muscle connection okay very important as well as just generating energy helps glucose absorption and lastly it helps hydrate you an average person needs between one and two teaspoons of sea salt a day now that figure because this does not take in consideration how much sweating or exercise you do but this is definitely a minimum right through in here okay the symptom number one symptom is weakness in your muscles if you salt you lethargy you know you that get up and go dizzy especially if you get up too fast because usually your blood pressure is too low so low blood pressure means you need more sea salt insomnia could be low salt in your diet so if you have insomnia you should try this tonight just put a little bit of salt maybe an eighth of a teaspoon in maybe a half a glass of water mix it up good in about i don slug it down see if you sleep better headache okay that can be a sign that you need more salt muscle cramps and you have a low tolerance to heat so you out in the sun and you just you can have intolerance to cold but other people have a low tolerance to heat that means you just need some sea salt now i want to show you this right here this is interesting of course you you already know this that sea salt is better than table salt right i don sea salt sea salt is concentrated sea water and an average sea salt is between 98 to 99.8 sodium chloride that only leaves you with point two to two percent of the minerals and the trace minerals that are left okay but i wanna bring up a chart on a a product that i recommend that i actually take i put it on my food that is very different than regular sea salt okay it i put a link down below and what unique about this sea salt is it has 77.5 sodium chloride which leaves room for a lot of other minerals and trace minerals in fact it leaves 22.5 percent room for all these other minerals so now look at the other ones down below like true salt is 99.9 cargill purified sea salt untreated is 99.9 morton salt 99.9 but there are lower in sodium chloride like the celtic sea salt which is 81.5 percent okay that sea salt which is 85.3 so you can see this chart there of sodium chloride in sea salt but check this out look at calcium right baja gold sea salt is 4490 parts per million compared to the other ones like celtic sea salt is only 1500 parts per million and look at cargill purified sea salt it parts per million now look at potassium 6 000 parts per million for the baja then if we move down the celtic it only 957 so the baja gold is more than six times the amount of potassium but look at jacobson sea salt that million in malden sea salt which is only 181 parts per million and look at cargill purified that then check out magnesium with the baja gold that hundred parts per million so if you compare it to everything else it off the charts now the question is how can they make salt with less sodium chloride and more minerals well what this salt is the location of where they get it in a pristine part of the world called the sea of cortez and what have the colorado river delta that drains into the sea of cortez so we have fresh water draining into ocean water and that dilutes the amount of sodium chloride so you the mountains that are flushed into this one spot where they then capture the salt and let it dry naturally by the sun they don lot of other companies and then you left with this very unique product it very interesting on your food it gives it a completely new flavor i love the flavor it just enhances the flavor of food which is very different than the sea salts which i also use as well but some of these sea salts are just overpowering with the sodium chloride so anyway i just wanted to introduce you to the baja gold sea salt and make you aware of the various signs that can occur when you sodium chloride now on the flip side potassium that and i put that video up right here check it out	Success
The Best Test to Determine How Long You Will Live	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maLKYkYWMT4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	well i don but you i don but it of course we all know we but how can we extend our life in fact that is to help people live longer and definitely a more quality of life now is there a really good test to determine how long you can you really tell by how many wrinkles a person has i mean the person who has the record for longevity is they live to 122 years that there probably were people that lived longer than that but it wasn documented i remember in practice i would do a lot of um seminars outside my office in different governmental agencies and uh one lady wanted me to come to where she was living in an assisted living home and they had um you know different age ranges from i guess 60 uh up to maybe 90. and i remember when i was in the room giving this presentation i asked the age of everyone in that room and i was shocked to find out there were people living there in their 60s that were literally in wheelchairs like 63 65 years old i was like wow incredible i years old and i just like a bizarre concept because i don i mean i remember being young and looking at my grandparents when they were in 50s thinking wow they so anyway i think your 60s are the new 40s okay that you can going to live based on the wrinkles that they have or how gray their hair is or how much they how much they lost their sight or if they lost their cognitive function some people that have dementia could live for a very long time now calcification is a good predictor of mortality if you have calcification in your arteries but as people age they become calcified their joints become calcified their tissues become stiff that calcium building up also as we age we get shorter we lose height our spine starts to shrink all right next one is bone loss which relates to being shorter and also as we age we tend to fall more than we should but there for longevity that i want to talk about and that is loss of muscle both in muscle mass and strength as we age we lose our muscle and that is a very strong association between loss of muscle strength and your mortality of aging not necessarily the mass of the muscle how big the muscle is but the strength of your muscle because as we age we get atrophy right we have a loss of muscle and the term for that is called sarcopenia and the number one muscle that affected first is the anterior thigh the quadricep okay this is why you see especially after menopause and more in women because they have more estrogen you weakness in that quadricep muscle you see it looks like cellulite but it atrophy which is a combination of fat but there so one test they use to determine sarcopenia other than a cat scan or mri which is the gold standard is a sit-to-sand time test or a chair stand test cst test so this test right here can indirectly give you a clue on kind of how much sarcopenia you have and indirectly that can be related to how long you live of course there factors but this can be a really good clue so i want to do an experiment right now okay i want you just to stand up right now if you sitting just stand up of course you probably not standing up watching your computer but stand up unless you your cell phone and comment down below if there does it take you a long time can you stand up very fast you know probably even a better test would be to sit on the floor and get up in a standing position if you have sarcopenia boy you and rock up and you push yourself up it long time to get up versus jumping up quickly which means you can rule out this condition really fast there okay there going to recommend one is a hand grip strength test okay you can use one of those grip strength devices and if you cannot grip strength 66 pounds or 30 kilograms of grip strength then potentially there could have this condition and if you pounds or 20 kilograms of grip strength so these are two really good home tests to just to see where you at on the scale of things now let talk about what we can do for longevity okay what can we do to increase um our length of life and make sure it can we do for sarcopenia a lot of people have this condition one of the biggest symptoms of a low vitamin d deficiency is muscle weakness okay so vitamin d is essential for making sure that your muscles stay strong especially if you have sarcopenia so the first thing that i would highly recommend is start taking vitamin d for your muscle strength it just so happens vitamin d is also associated with longevity because vitamin d is intimately involved with your immune system with inflammation it great for the heart it involved with so many different things it it can affect so vitamin d is slightly important okay number two resistance training very very important if you can maintain a routine exercise program okay where you exercise that would be very therapeutic to your longevity versus not doing exercise or doing it inconsistently now i like to switch up my exercises i all sorts of different exercises like i backwards i a guy by the name of ben patrick which is the knees over toes guy it was a really good interview which involves walking backwards and pulling things backwards so i exercise but lately i pilates i really like pilates works the whole body and a new type of exercise which is actually quite fascinating it it gyrotonics i fascinating uh exercise program that involves strengthening motions okay and like a 3d not like a flexion extension type exercise but you exercising your entire body in different ranges of motion so you see it to understand it you have to go to a gym that has these machines it pretty awesome all right number three this is very important not just for sarcopenia but for longevity nutrient-dense foods i one little example let you are deficient in folic acid okay or folate right well that alone can create the same damage as radiation okay to your dna so in other words if you folate your dna uh become damaged and they can that alone will shorten your life there fascinating research that nutrient okay number four fasting this will extend your life definitely but let older and you have sarcopenia and maybe you just do one meal a day right because you might not be in a situation you can fast five days especially if your muscles are weak um not a good idea but one meal a day very smart but fasting increases growth hormone it increases autophagy which is the recycling of old damaged proteins it definitely increase your life okay number five keep your cortisol low cortisol is very destructive on your muscles okay especially your legs and your butt muscle if you haven that video down below but cortisol is necessary in normal amounts but not in high amounts if you have too much cortisol boy that will just really paralyze your immune system and shorten your life number six and i think from my own viewpoint this is should be number one okay state of mind if they done research on this having a life that has meaning is very vital for your longevity your role happiness and unfortunately it not the majority there people that are doing what they really want to do but i would venture to say that state of mind is the number one factor for longevity all right number seven adequate and quality protein if we dealing with sarcopenia we with having the raw material to replace all your proteins not just muscle but all the biochemical pathways we need adequate protein and we definitely need quality protein eggs are at the top of the list okay and then if we just talk about sarcopenia itself there called leucine called h m or b it leucine that can help correct sarcopenia i just want to add this to the mix because if someone has sarcopenia this is a good remedy and there longevity and so i think your next most important video to watch would be on this topic right here check it out you	Success
The Calcium-Osteoporosis Myth	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-2lr6zuILA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	i think there for a fact that osteoporosis is merely lacking calcium in your bone but the problem with that viewpoint is when you start taking calcium you will make your bones slightly more dense but you do not decrease your risk of getting fractures so taking calcium is not only not the answer but it can make things worse one of the challenges with osteoporosis is there have an increased risk of getting a fracture and the problem is if you older and you fracture your hip boy the recovery from that is just devastating most people that fracture their hip do not live past a year after the fracture so it good prognosis the problem with taking calcium is it actually increases your risk of getting a fracture interesting i mean if you think about it one of the biggest best predictors of a myocardial infarction heart attack is having a high cac score which stands for coronary artery calcification score it the calcium in your coronary artery that predicts heart attacks and so by dumping more calcium into your body you situation calcium is very unique in that we definitely need it but we really need to get it from our diet primarily we shouldn supplement at least a lot of it especially what it that body does not get rid of calcium very easily and that also goes with other minerals like iron for example whereas potassium is easily excreted if we have too much but certain minerals do not exit the body very easily so if you dumping all this calcium in the tissues you can end up with excess calcium and if you think about it as people age they tend to calcify don start filling up with calcium their arteries fill up with calcium uh they have all sorts of spurring and they in their back but here with too much calcium arrhythmias increase your risk for getting a stroke heart attack high blood pressure because the arteries become calcified there elasticity you get soft tissue calcium not just calcium in the arteries but calcium in the joints and the other tissues of the body not to mention excessive amount of calcium in your kidneys as a kidney stone other symptoms would be constipation depression psychosis arthritis tendonitis bursitis and even abdominal pain so too much calcium is not good we need sufficient calcium but we don of the real causes of osteoporosis include being on steroids right corticosteroid hormones or having too much cortisol in your body for some reason let example you have a tumor in your adrenal gland that cortisol then you develop a condition called cushing syndrome where osteoporosis is one symptom of that also lower amount of estrogen so let through menopause or you had your ovaries removed that can lead to osteoporosis you need a good amount of estrogen to prevent osteoporosis and this is why women tend to get more osteoporosis than men taking too much phosphoric acid from soft drinks right sodas that will do it not having enough vitamin d this is really really really a big one right here so by not only taking vitamin d you can absorb more calcium from food but vitamin d also works with vitamin k2 another key vitamin to help calcium go in the right place if you don sufficient vitamin d then you really only absorb about 10 of the calcium from your food so vitamin d doesn effects like calcium does malnutrition can also cause osteoporosis let minerals or amino acids things like that that could be a problem if you ppis because you have heartburn or gerd you then really blocks your ability to absorb all minerals and so since bone is composed not just of calcium but minerals and also phosphorus and a lot of other things including protein ppis can really create a problem gastric bypass can be a risk factor as well as malabsorption where you don healthy lining of the colon to be able to absorb certain nutrients then you could be at risk of osteoporosis here your calcium from food i would say the best source getting bioavailable calcium would be raw milk cheese okay if you can get some of that that would be the ideal situation also leafy greens would do it sardines fish nuts all have calcium increase your vitamin d to at least 20 000 iu k2 because you always need these together very very important i would recommend if you international units of vitamin d then you need 200 micrograms of this k2 together all right vitamin c very very important in bone health okay you need vitamin c for collagen which is a type of protein in bone bone is not just minerals it is a key factor if you don vitamin c you build bone in fact people that have a sub clinical vitamin c deficiency like a borderline scurvy situation their bones are always osteoporotic trace minerals very very important in activating the protein in your bone as well as being a part of the bone and so a good trace metal product will be essential for bone and i want to back up to vitamin c make sure you take a food based vitamin c not a synthetic version of vitamin c adequate quality protein is also important so if you like peanut butter or for example some soy protein powder or something like that that would not be a good source of protein eggs are the best source seafood shellfish fish meat all high quality protein betaine hydrochloride is another thing i would recommend if you have osteopenia or osteoporosis because that fixes the lack of stomach acid that creating all the symptoms for acid reflux so obtain hydrochloride especially as you important to start absorbing these minerals as well as breaking down the protein that that note i think the next most important video to watch would be the one on vitamin k2 check it out i put it right here you	Success
The REAL Reason You Have Erectile Dysfunction	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd37ILZwgKM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you know there have problems with erectile dysfunction and they try different medications like viagra i think there that they might try and sometimes it will help them sometimes it doesn side effects and of course the ideal situation would be to find the root cause and correct that or at the very minimum take something that doesn these other side effects because there quite a few side effects not to mention the small ones like headache low blood pressure dizziness but also heart attacks so there are dangerous side effects to taking any medication of course with this video i telling you not to take any medications check with your doctor before implementing what i now if you research this problem you going to find you know they there combination between hormonal imbalances neurological problems and a vascular problem with risk factors being aging smoking drinking obesity diabetes stress heart disease and inflammation well that heart of this problem that to know i always get clues by studying the mechanism of how medications work so if we look at viagra for example it works by inhibiting a certain enzyme in fact most medications either inhibit an enzyme or stimulate an enzyme enzymes in the body are proteins and they do certain functions in the body and so with the case of viagra it inhibits this pde5 which is involved with smooth muscle of someone to make this really simple there whole cascade of effects that occur when you take this enzyme inhibitor okay with the end result being enhanced nitric oxide which affects the nerves and the arteries which gives you a prolonged erection because the smooth muscle is now relaxed allowing blood flow into the penis without the venous flow coming out so basically it keeps the blood flow from leaving okay and so that is how this medication works and of course the question i have is is there a natural pde5 inhibitor and the answer is yes there is and there other solutions this mechanism works indirectly there are other treatments that work directly by increasing nitric oxide which again does this thing i just mentioned right here like for example there cream which has less side effects it has a direct effect it works quicker but it does have side effects and you have to go to the doctor and they have to adjust the dosage some people also use something called l-arginine which is an amino acid which actually there that it works so that that you have i well zinc will increase testosterone and it will increase sperm count but apparently there i could find that it will help someone with erectile dysfunction but these are the four things that i today number one fasting yeah and i down below fasting can actually increase nitric oxide and there success stories that i years where people start to improve erectile dysfunction once they start fasting of course that they have blood sugar issues either they or insulin resistance so of course fasting is going to correct that there this enzyme inhibitor okay horny goat weed forskolin as well as black ginger so a lot of people get results with these and they have much less side effects also exercise specifically weight training and or intense exercise with good recovery because if there much stress and not enough sleep that this is another one that is credible and there on that and number four which i want to talk about which is an interesting uh modality it shock wave therapy now this term shockwave kind of scares people but it okay apparently they use this therapy for a lot of different things with different intensity of waves they can use it to break up kidney stones they use it for bursitis tendinitis because if you lower the intensity of a wave you can create an anti-inflammatory effect but with these devices which they have like centers that you can go to to get this procedure done and they also have do-it-yourself devices what it does is it creates a micro trauma okay a very small trauma just like exercise which then results in increased blood vessels called neovascularization as well as breaking up plaquing if there penis so apparently it with some pretty hardcore placebo-controlled uh clinical trials with some studies that show up to 70 results the thing i like about this is there side effects so something to research i and there to emphasize and that is stress okay if someone is stressed out they they okay they or fly to fight dominant mode they going to have low amounts of parasympathetic as far as the underlying cause we have a situation where the person is usually sympathetic dominant they that great they they have a low parasympathetic reserve so it maintain an erection so another really important point that goes beyond diet is really handling this recovery stress sleep situation and for that data you should probably watch this video right here you	Success
Here's Why You Lost Your BUTT but Gained a BELLY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnSp_JR5pZk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we you lost your butt yet you gained a belly and there this book right here the siba collection of medical illustrations volume 4 endocrine system on page 85 okay this is the picture of someone with too much cortisol cortisol if excessive can break down the quads and the glutamus maximus right here so let me just explain and i to diagnose you with that condition which is called cushing because you don with cushing level of cortisol it happens gradually so you can have a version of that but not a full-blown cushing just because of high cortisol so since cortisol is a stress and a survival hormone what it tends to do is keep your sugar levels available so you can use it as quick energy and also it will rob peter to pay paul it will take um extra things from your body that you might not need or you have extra like the gluteus maximus is the largest muscle in the body so apparently it has extra amino acids to convert over into glucose then you have the next largest muscle which is the thigh muscle the quadricep so both of these muscles are then broken down and that process is a catabolic effect catabolic means you breaking down something from protein to amino acid and then from amino acid to glucose in the process you also atrophy of the muscles which could look like cellulite but it it so we get muscle amino acids sugar glucose and then that to fat with the help of insulin so now the question is what causes this condition and then of course what can we do about it well there that you have some type of inflammatory condition that cortisol and one of the side effects is cushing cortisol now when a woman goes through menopause they will lose the ovary function or to some degree not 100 but there adrenals so if you go into menopause with adrenal weakness or adrenal stress then you can develop a higher level of cortisol because the adrenals are now coping with that extra function and that can affect a lot of things it can affect the loss of collagen in your joints even you can have bone loss because there protein in the bone itself but also this is probably why you see a lot of women after menopause that lose the butt in the quads and then we just have a situation where you go through chronic stress for a period of time that can do it or let have a tumor on either the adrenal gland or the pituitary gland that can also do it birth control pills this is interesting birth control pills has many side effects one being pseudo cushing cushing coming from the same mechanism it coming from a different mechanism where there is an increase of something called cortical steroid binding globulin now what does that mean that means that where there in your liver called cbg okay cortical steroid binding globulin and what the heck is that that is a combination of protein connected to cortisol so in other words about 90 percent of all the cortisol in the body is bound to a protein and so that way it have similar mechanisms for testosterone and estrogen as well but we don free cortisol in the body so we have to put it in an inactive or a bound state to protein well the problem is birth control pills increases this cbg thereby increasing cortisol okay now you also see this same mechanism in pregnancy it probably could also happen if you are on some type of estrogen therapy as in hormone replacement therapy possibly or even possibly if you dominant okay for some reason the more fat that you have in your body both men and women the more estrogen you makes more estrogen but i didn that because there research on that topic now there are other things that are not related to necessarily cortisol that can create atrophy of your butt and your thigh okay like one would be sarcopenium now what is a sarcopenia that is a condition where you losing muscle mass and strength with age okay and i have done a video on that and i will put a link down below so that cause you but there that inactivity so if you day you have a desk job uh and you have no exercise well this is the body shape that you get or let pain that prevents you from activating these muscles and that could do it as well so what is the solution right here if you are on prednisone you want to find an alternative okay and i don prednisone for whatever reason i would there in fact i do have a video on that and i will put that down below but typically there solution to whatever medication you taking of course check with your doctor like adaptogens for example like ashwagandha is a great stress reducer and it can greatly support your adrenals the gland behind the cortisol also vitamin d is a natural anti-inflammatory a very potent and powerful one and it if you for that reason maybe you should try something a little different all right number two reduce your stress so whatever the source of your stress is do whatever you can to reduce the stress doing physical work is one of the best remedies for overall mental stress it takes your mind off things and it works your physical body and of course exercise itself is great for stress especially long walks or any type of exercise as long as you avoid over training which is not good for high cortisol number three if you get on the ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting you the flight or fight mechanism the sympathetics and increase the parasympathetic nervous system okay that can help lower cortisol and this is why when people go on keto and if they don anymore they feel better less depressed so it can actually change your whole mood number four the key nutrients that you need to help balance and reduce cortisol potassium eat foods high in potassium or find a potassium supplement potassium is a natural physiological tranquilizer it relaxes the muscles it calms down your body also magnesium very very important just so happens that potassium magnesium are in leafy greens like in large amounts of salad b1 which i like to get from nutritional yeast also is one of the best natural things to lower cortisol you difference you take it like in a form of nutritional yeast and you wait like four minutes you just wow it just gives you relief um all right so now we have sleep of course that is vitally important because the less sleep you have the more cortisol you have the worse the blood sugars i have a ton of videos on that which i put some important ones down below and then number six limit the amount of things that stimulate the adrenals like caffeine like tea like chocolate like um energy drinks all that will prevent you from sleeping and there kind of invisible emf electromagnetic fields from your cell phone from the computer i bought a tester okay i did a video on this i found that sitting behind a computer for i don probably 14 hours a day i was being bathed in electromagnetic fields which when i completely rearranged my computer and things i felt an instant drop in stress so i think this has a really big factor you should watch the video i did on this because it stressor that is so common yet it mentioned hardly anywhere so i to put that video up right here check it out you	Success
The TOP Nutritional Deficiency Behind Constipation	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeS3UqRiI6g	Dr. Eric Berg DC	there nutritional deficiency behind constipation i want to share with you today this is actually very very interesting and it makes a lot of sense once you get all the information i want to start here with a couple facts there are more nerves in your gut than there are in your spinal column you also have a very long nerve called the vagus nerve that goes between your brain and your gut and is bidirectional which means it goes up and down it carries information back and forth now the vagus nerve is connected to the lower part of the brain called the brain stem and in that brain stem you have the core of something called the autonomic nervous system the system that runs on automatic okay now many times people think there have the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic but you have actually a third part it entire and so that is called the second brain and it innervates the entire gut and it i the brain stem or shall i say the autonomic nervous system is very vulnerable to thymine deficiencies that deficiencies when you don thymine all sorts of things go wacko with the autonomic nervous system and this especially rates to anything nerve okay like the nerve innervation to the smooth muscle in your gut which controls something called peristalsis i mean if you think about what constipation really is it lack of peristalsis the peristalsis is not working you uh waste through the body and so it stagnant it if you deficiency it beriberi but there gastrointestinal berry berry which involves the blocking of peristalsis your intestines just don so things just kind of sit there and so this occurs because there is a b1 deficiency that is in the brain stem that controls all these nerves from above the brainstem and especially the autonomic nervous system depend on getting enough b1 and so when they don have enough the vagus nerve cannot use acetylcholine to allow this to occur and so acetylcholine is like a hormone within your nervous system okay it depends on vitamin b1 you see you normally you supposed to eat food you have all this acid in the stomachs breaking down the protein creating an environment which kills pathogens okay the absorption of certain uh minerals and the food comes down this little pipe right here and you have this little sac called the gallbladder that secretes a bile that helps you start breaking down the fats with the help of the pancreas and the pancreas also releases additional enzymes to break down this food stuff right here and then you have the small intestine right here and 90 of all the digestion occurs in the small intestine right and then it empties into the large intestine where you have more digestion and fermentation of things that are not digested or we don have the capacity to digest like fiber and then it comes out through here and so when people have constipation we have a backup of this whole system and so so people will start taking probiotics they betaine hydrochloride they purified bile salts they and sometimes they depend on either medication like laxatives or even herbal laxatives which are much better but when you have to keep taking something over and over and over it right problem and i laxatives if they you at the same time try to correct what because the danger of constipation is greater than the danger of taking laxatives because it auto-intoxication where the waste just sits there okay it just sits there it doesn back up and create a lot of toxicity not only does a thymine deficiency cause this peristalsis problem but the thymine deficiency also inhibits hcl in the stomach it inhibits your stomach acid okay the stuff that you need to break down protein so if you have undigested protein that alone can cause constipation you need this acid to also kill microbes so you don microbes in the wrong place like in your small intestine which is called small intestinal bacterial overgrowth which comes from a lack of hydrochloric acid so that low vitamin b1 thymine also inhibits gastric motility talking about the motility of your stomach not just the intestines but the stomach mobility too and so a version of that condition is called gastroparesis where everything is kind of just really sluggish going through the digestive system and i video on gastroparesis before which basically is this slowing down of your digestion being caused by diabetes because diabetes involves high level of carbohydrates and sugar which is one of the primary causes of a b1 deficiency refine carbohydrates or refined sugar as in the breads the pasta the cereal the crackers the biscuits the pancakes etc so you eat a lot of carbohydrates you get diabetes you create a b1 deficiency and then you get gastroparesis not to mention a lot of other problems with the nervous system but this is a side note by diabetics typically get peripheral neuropathy the bottom of their feet becomes numb burning painful because of a lack of b1 b1 deficiency affects the nervous system at many different levels and so what we talking about here is the relationship and connection between a b1 deficiency and your autonomic nervous system which originates in the brain stem but extends out to the vagus nerve and into the enteric nervous system now a b1 deficiency can also inhibit pancreatic enzymes okay so now we can release the enzymes to digest 90 of your digestion occurs in the small intestine with a lot of help from that pancreas right here also a b1 deficiency like i just said causes gastroparesis and another condition which i define bilirary dyskinesia now what is biliary dyskinesia that is simply a sluggish gallbladder the gallbladder should contract and release bile but with this condition it doesn sluggish okay so we a lack of bile we the muscular the soft tissue that supposed to be contracting and releasing the bile well you have less bile to help you digest and that all comes from a b1 deficiency so as you can see the common thread behind constipation is a lack of thymine now if you remedy i would highly recommend you find one that is natural not synthetic now since we there fascinating vitamin you should check out this video i did at my one of my summits i right here check it out you	Success
How to STOP Acid Reflux Instantly	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbU_Pw2AegM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	i want to show you how to completely stop acid reflux once and for all i had acid reflux really bad in college i was downing massive amounts of tums not having a clue of what caused it i really wish i knew back then what i know now because it would have been so easy to correct i mean just months and months of suffering this terrible heartburn i have to kind of sit up like propped up in my bed to try to have it drain because at night it would be terrible so what is acid reflux it where you regurgitating coming up through a valve into the esophagus and that valve is called the lower esophageal sphincter now the most important thing to know about acid reflux is that it not enough acid okay there deficiency of acid in your stomach and that acid is not triggering a certain mechanism to close the valve at the top of the stomach at the bottom of the esophagus and then the valve doesn regurgitates so the term for this low acid situation is called hypochlorhydria that is the root cause of your heartburn so that means low stomach acid there called a chlorhydria which there acid in your stomach okay and that happens with people as they get older and older in fact as we age we lose the acid in our stomach and we have all sorts of digestive problems 30 of the population over the age of 60 has a deficiency of stomach acid so it deal so what happens is we get on antacids we take medication to deal with this and then of course the side effects from that are horrendous because we of what we should be doing so it makes us feel better temporarily but the next time we eat it gets worse and worse and worse and we never come off this medication it is so important to ensure that our stomach has the right ph and the normal ph of the stomach should be between one and three that is extremely acid okay so on the ph scale you have seven being neutral and so if it goes up like eight nine ten that more alkaline as it goes below seven that is more acid in each whole number that you go down it so in other words a ph of 5 is 10 times more acid than a ph of six okay so if we a ph of one to three that is extremely acidic and that to break down proteins to absorb minerals and vitamins like b12 and folic acid and vitamin c and also another reason why we need it is to kill off microbes fungus bacteria to prevent those microbes from growing in our small intestine the key thing about the stomach as far as the release of that acid and the closing of that valve is that there words that valve normally should close if there called gastrin that causes the release of hydrochloric acid so this is communication from the level of acid to the valve and that the closing and opening of the valve and this whole thing is under parasympathetic control now what does that mean it the part of the nervous system that controls digestion and rest okay so that opposes the other system that called the sympathetic which is the flight of fight so what does that mean the more stress that you have the more acid reflex you because as you increase the sympathetics you decrease the parasympathetic so stress is another reason why we have a lot of problems with the stomach and the reason why we might have acid reflux or another term for that would be gerd now there of having the right amount of acid and i hydrochloric acid also helps you release bile from your gallbladder it helps to cause the gallbladder to contract and release the bile to help you extract fat soluble vitamins from your food as well as omega-3 fatty acids and help you break down fats also this hydrochloric acid helps stimulate the pancreas to produce enzymes to help you digest food so without that acid being at the right ph you sufficient bile release and you going to have sufficient enzymes released and that a lot of other problems a little bit lower down in this chain reaction and then what happens is you might have bacteria and fungus that then grows in the small intestine and that sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and then every time you you just feel bloated you feel distended and this will definitely occur if you and probiotics so yeah that one last thing about hydrochloric acid you need the correct ph of the stomach to keep h pylori in check normally our bodies have h pylori and it when we lose the stomach acid then it comes out and it creates problems so this is just another important reason why we need this hcl hydrochloric acid in our stomach the other thing that can mess us up in relationship to not having enough hydrochloric acid is low zinc which is very common for so many people if you have a tendency to have problems with gerd as well as acid reflux as well as ulcers so it takes a sufficient amount of zinc to make hydrochloric acid it also takes other things like chlorides as in sodium chloride like salt to make hydrochloric acid it also takes a good amount of potassium to make hydrochloric acid so it might be your problem is really coming from a zinc deficiency maybe a chloride deficiency or even a potassium deficiency so it hydrochloric acid it raw materials that can actually build up your your acid now another thing that a lot of doctors do not have any information about is the connection between taking calcium and having too much calcium and having acid reflux or gerd so one of the big side effects of taking a calcium antacid is acid reflux it insane and the problem is if you don understand a connection you could be giving someone the absolute worst thing to give them for that condition so if you doctor for this condition definitely tell them to research the link between hypercalcemia and gerd or acid reflux now people don antacids they take other types of medication for acid reflux like ppis for example and the problem with those medications is that there massive side effects like inflammation your kidney nephritis like getting fractures from osteoporosis getting other pathogens like c diff so there are a lot of side effects from these antacids all right so here recommend the best remedy for this is to take something to build up your hydrochloric acid and that hydrochloride and this is how you take it you start off taking like three right before a meal see how you feel okay let it next meal take four next meal take five before a meal and you keep increasing it until your symptoms go away and it could take seven eight or more of these little petaine hydrochloride tablets before you have no more acid reflux now all this means is that you you have to build it back up and it does take time i would also recommend this so let betaine hydrochloride okay and your acid reflux goes away and you feel great i would continue to take a little bit more until you start getting kind of like a maybe a heartburn or a warmness in your stomach which means you back off that way you can know exactly how much you really need to fix this problem number two make sure you salt in the diet because those are the the precursors to building hydrochloric acid number three i would make sure you which is also very important in this process and number four chew your food longer okay that assist this whole process especially right now if you don hydrochloric acid in your stomach um you just need to chew more and that to help this process and make everything go a little bit faster and number five make sure you keep your stress down because uh stress could be aggravating the situation um we don a sympathetic dominant mode we want you to be in the parasympathetic where you so you really want to put your body in a relaxed state when you eat because it going to help your digestion now on

The Dark Side of the Birth Control Pill	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRfeEraLFqQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	i side of the birth control pill now this is fascinating because there actually is no real estrogen or progesterone in a birth control pill what you do have is a synthetic version altered in a way to mimic estrogen and progesterone okay but it has some slight minor complications it comes with a package it can increase your risk of heart attacks high blood pressure stroke blood clots breast cancer dementia depression acne mood swings it can even trigger autoimmune diseases especially lupus it can cause you to gain weight by increasing cortisol and insulin it can also deplete you of zinc selenium magnesium b12 another side effect it can create is something called melasma which is like a hyperpigmentation of your skin where your the pigment of your skin is darker in like a rash form also it can alter the microbiome not only in your gut but in the vaginal canal as well now when you think about the reason why women take the pill mainly to prevent getting pregnant but they also might take it to prevent heavy cycles and have you bleeding okay so there it so the birth control pill basically tricks the brain and shuts down ovulation ovulation is usually about right around day 14 when there taking the birth control pill you shut down ovulation and you also shut down menses so you typically you don women still do spot but what a lot of women don this pill you are shutting down the production of estrogen and progesterone you see in a monthly cycle a woman has a spike of estrogen at day 14 and then they have this other increase of progesterone the second half of the month so this is very different than men that make testosterone on a daily basis but women make their two hormones progesterone and estrogen more with like two major spikes not necessarily every day so the problem is when we remove this okay we term i effects that can occur after menopause to the bone even longevity you see the reason why women live longer than men really has to do with estrogen estrogen can act as an antioxidant but all this is kind of depressing if you a birth control so what should you do well let look at the effectiveness of how well these birth control pill methods work of preventing pregnancies okay so the pill is between 93 to 99 effective depending on how well that you use the pill and follow directions okay then we have vaginal rings which is 93 effective you also have iuds you have the hormone version which is 94 effective and you have the copper iud which is 99 effective now the copper iud which i did a video on is a bit better than birth control because it has less side effects but it does come with certain complications condoms 87 effective but this next one is something that you should look into i like it it natural cycle birth control it that you track you don creams or medications or anything and it between 93 and 98 effective depending on how well you implement it and you follow the instructions i mean considering some of the side effects from some of these compared to this it so i put a link down below so you can do some research on this method right here because this may be a safe solution now if you to continue on the pill i would highly recommend the same time you do things to counter some of the the chemicals that are in your liver and i would recommend beefing up no pun intended your cruciferous vegetables as well as fermented vegetables i about sauerkraut and kimchi and maybe even a good probiotic as well as taking more zinc selenium b12 and magnesium to counter the deficiencies that this pill has created now one last point if you taking the pill for other reasons let say you are trying to avoid a heavy period this is the video that you should see next check it out you	Success
Natural Remedy for Anaphylactic Shock	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh0R-avRMuM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	i want to talk about a natural remedy for an anaphylactic shock from a severe allergy and usually they use what called an epipen which they inject into your muscles and that some very unique functions in that it can dilate the bronchial tubes it can open up the coronary artery it relaxes the smooth muscle it increases more blood flow to the muscle and smooth muscle and it increases the heart output so it counteracts these very severe allergies but there are contraindications for epipens so what is the person to do if they have this anaphylactic shock if they have an overactive thyroid if they have diabetes or a disease that sounds like parkinson it and then also if you have glaucoma you can pressure or angina or if you have cardiac heart disease okay so i want to give you an alternative but let me just run through some of the symptoms the symptoms can be life-threatening but typically you get itchy-ness a rash your eyes might swell your lungs will tighten up to the point where you can throat can tighten up your tongue can severely swell where it can obstruct your breathing get shortness of breath light-headedness you may even have a loss of consciousness low blood pressure or you might go into shock and this can happen from an insect bite or some insect venom or it could be from nuts like a peanut or seeds like in sesame seeds or milk shellfish fish eggs sulfites which is in dried fruit it byproducts of fermentation so if they took nutritional yeast or apple cider vinegar sourdough bread also it can come from antibiotics dyes latex exercise can trigger an anaphylactic shock in certain people as well as side effects from vaccines it really weird that we have these allergies we the environment and then when we come in contact with that thing it can create all sorts of uh negative reactions and they can be very intense the interesting thing about this is that children that live in a sterile environment when they raised tend to get more autoimmune diseases and tend to get more severe allergies to the point where you can have an anaphylactic shock because there has been no stress on their immune system to build it up and the reason i we system okay and then the other half is acquired it immune system and we develop that through being exposed to certain things and then going through the reaction and having our immune system being stressed getting sick recovering and then now being prepared and bulletproof it okay that were never properly trained you never stressed out that army in fact you probably gave them stress cards and then you also never put them through basic training you made it very easy for them and so when they army they will be easily defeated so this is just another example of how important it is not to be stress-free all the time especially with a child i mean children that live on farms that are exposed to a lot of microbes children that pets have a much better immune system so if your child gets sick don child gets sick often don quickly suppress the fever or the cold or the sinus problem let them go through this immune system with good nutrition but don bad thing what in a sterile environment for too long all right now let remedies for an anaphylactic shock and the first one is called f a h f ii okay it chinese herbs i mean it placebo-controlled clinical trial tested against peanut-induced anaphylaxis and it stands for food allergy herbal formula real easy to remember and you can seek out this formula and get it if you have an anaphylactic shock and just keep it ready because if it can help you with the peanut allergy chances are it can help you with other types of anaphylactic shock reactions you know there that have been known to help anaphylactic shock severe and so here are some other ones sweet chestnut asian rose and the third one is hearty orange so if you can something else as a backup but it important to keep this you know close by you in case you run into a situation and of course what i telling you right now check with your doctor before implementing because i not telling you not to use an epipen okay just want to point that out the next four remedies i aren emergency anaphylactic shock okay they over time so it doesn anaphylactic shock or a severe hypersensitivity so number three is called oral immunotherapy okay and the effectiveness is like 60 to 80 percent in which you a very small dose of the thing that they over months okay so there that you can give a person that they don them that amount supervised by a doctor and then you slowly increase it to the point where you of that that substance okay so that one kind of natural therapy and number four vitamin d vitamin d is very important to build the immune system up uh it really a steroid it cortisol but it it tends to regulate the immune system which is exactly what you need to do all right number five fasting has been known to significantly reduce hypersensitivities and allergies because it corrects the immune system now i would recommend doing a three-day fast once a month if you get anaphylactic shock for whatever allergy and you did a three-day fast every month and then you also did routine in a minute fasting i think you would see significant improvements just from that alone and the last thing i want to mention is probiotics here current research being done on developing certain type of probiotics that can greatly reduce allergies and even the intensity of anaphylactic shock so the exact formula of which microbes or beneficial microbes you need to take is just unknown right now i think any probiotic would be better than no probiotic i mean think about what the side effect of an antibiotic is allergies that and even anaphylactic shock so probiotics are important since 80 percent of our immune system resides in our colon and since allergies are related to the immune system you should check out my video i did on doing fasting to strengthen your immune system and i put that one right up here check it out you	Success
THIS Is What Happens When You Run Out of Electrolytes (NOT GOOD)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI39SNPie_M	Dr. Eric Berg DC	what would actually happen if you ran out of electrolytes now if you ran out completely you would die but if you ran out just a little bit all sorts of things would happen but the main big thing that will happen is you of your nerves your muscles and your cells i have a really short little demo to tell you exactly what i mean all right we demonstration we have a light source we have a power source it the wall over here you can see the cords and we have an incomplete circuit okay electrical circuit we cut the wire and we put the wire into distilled water distilled water is water without minerals and without electrolytes electrolytes are electrically charged minerals okay so we have no conductivity here you can see there there some electrolytes here take a scoop of electrolytes and we to this distilled water and let okay now we water to make sure it dissolving and look what have a complete circuit now so one of the main purposes of electrolytes in the body is to power the nervous system which is the electrical system the body which powers the muscles and all the different organs all right so now that you know generally what electrolytes are let you would create a deficiency well one way is when you start doing fasting especially if you do prolong fasting and you only drink water without electrolytes you see our bodies don store electrolytes for a long period of time i magnesium sodium chlorides or calcium okay they don if you you you eating you electrolytes and a lot of people are already running on a low tank of electrolytes and so when they start fasting they might not feel good they might feel dizzy they get fatigued keto flu other symptoms and they might even pass out very important to take electrolytes when you do fasting all right number two if you start the ketogenic diet you may run out of electrolytes why because you switching to ketones or fat fuel you running on glucose and what happens is your body dumps a lot of these stored glucose so store glucose as glycogen is just a bunch of glucose molecules strung together with a lot of water because for every one gram of glucose that you have three grams of water so glycogen is a fluid-filled sugary substance that and stored in your muscles it stored in the brain it and the muscles and other organs as well so what happens when you stop eating sugar is you start dumping all this glycogen as well as fluid an average person could lose like 13 pounds of extra fluid and with the fluid comes electrolyte so you lot of electrolytes like even potassium so this is why i recommend electrolytes with keto and fasting but on the flip side when you consume a high carb diet especially if there carbs involved in that high carb diet you also become deficient electrolytes because to store that sugar as glycogen you also need potassium so when you lose glycogen when you do keto you lose potassium and then when you consume a lot of high carbohydrates you lose potassium because it glycogen which is not always readily available to you quick story my wife and i when we got married like 31 years ago we went to this italian restaurant and we had massive amounts of pasta pizza bread desserts wine more desserts more bread more pasta so we too good okay i try to go to bed and my pulse rate is just like bam bam bam bam just like way way too high i didn know back then what it was but reflecting back it was a major potassium deficiency because to store all that sugar my body was sucking potassium out of the blood and pushing into that glycogen and so the pulse rate went up and that number four increase pulse rate when you run out of electrolytes now also when you sweat vomit have diarrhea if you all of these can create an electrolyte deficiency all right the next question is what symptoms occur when you start running out of electrolytes arrhythmias why because electrolytes power muscle not just your muscles like the skeletal muscles but your cardiac muscles and so you may not uh initially just feel arrhythmias you might just feel like a heart palpitation that could be an electrolyte deficiency right number two fatigue why because electrolytes power the body they give the body energy and the two minerals sodium potassium work as a major pump to generate a tremendous amount of energy in all the cells to make everything work and without those two electrolytes things are going to be very very low electrically that fatigue when you start keto because a lot of people don you might experience muscle weakness that person salts okay three dizziness and dehydration you just don have the fluid to run the body and if we don because we number four i already talked about that five muscle twitches spasm and cramps so many people when they these cramps and they don is it six constipation well your colon is smooth muscle so again it muscle that can be affected by electrolytes seven headache and brain swelling now this relates to a sodium deficiency many times it could relate to other things but let exercise and drink a lot of water and sweat and not put the electrolytes back in and you kept drinking more and more water you can end up with a severe sodium deficiency that hyponatremia where the brain actually starts swelling so it hydrated just with water we with electrolytes and water number eight you can go into shock number nine feel nauseated you know get the keto flu 10 a loss of blood clotting factors and that see there happen when you run out of electrolytes probably the most important electrolyte is potassium because you need it in such large amounts if you haven video on potassium i put it up right here check it out	Success
#1 Top Remedy for Calcium Plaque in Your Arteries	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6V_3W0uG6k	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you know having calcium in your arteries is not a good thing in fact the coronary artery calcification test is one of the best tests to predict mortality from all deaths so that can get done to see if you have calcium in your arteries but my question is this why does calcium end up in the arteries in the first place is it just merely a lack of vitamin k2 that the calcium is building up or is it part of the band-aid that comes with cholesterol and protein now the big danger of you having plaque in the arteries is it breaking off and getting lodged somewhere where it stops oxygen to either your heart or your brain so you either get a heart attack or a stroke so i think it important to understand more about this plaquing and definitely why the calcium is in there well i want to introduce you to biofilms what is a biofilm biofilms are collective groups of microbes like bacteria or fungus or other microbes that tend to attach to surfaces okay now in the environment 95 of all the bacteria live in the communities okay as bio films i mean if you just go to the park where you see a little stream where there water and you pick up a rock in the stream you slippery a little film on that rock that is biofilms bacteria and other microbes are forming together and they rock well the same thing happens in your body with tartar on your teeth that tartar plaque is biofilms and so these microbes work together to help their survival and they release calcium to protect themselves which also allows them to go underneath the radar with our own immune system so our immune system has a hard time finding and attacking them and so biofilms are resistant to antibiotics in fact they become stronger when you take antibiotics so this is a survival mechanism created by these microbes to just survive better so even when you get like these tonsil stones they found biofilm in those tonsil stones they the joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients now my thought is and i trying to do research on this do you also have biofilms in patients with osteoarthritis or maybe spurring or even stenosis that would be interesting information but i don has done a study on that there biofilms in the arteries of diabetic patients with severe artery disease biofilms also exist on catheters when you get a prosthetic like an artificial hip or anything in your body involving plastic tubing these microbes tend to leech on attach and develop biofilms now another side note with biofilms is that one of the things they do eat is iron and your friendly microbes also compete for this iron and since we plaque and stress there increase in risk from getting a heart attack and dying from stress by 18.4 percent as well as an increase of dying from heart attack when you exercise by 14.1 if you have plaque in your arteries now the one theory on that is stress increases epinephrine epinephrine increases the release of free iron which apparently can feed the biofilms increase those colonies and then they can break off and lodge somewhere else in the body so what do we do about this problem how do we get rid of biofilms this remedy i is considered quackery it attacked it conventional medicine and definitely unscientific in snake oil despite having massive credible research that is in the scientific journals there different papers in the scientific journals on this one remedy and that is this hydrogen peroxide now you hydrogen peroxide being a great um disinfectant uh using it to clean um your counter spaces you know from mold and maybe you heard its effectiveness as a mouthwash to help reduce tartar on your teeth but when i did a deep dive on this topic i was blown away by the amount of scientific research on this topic which i down below and personally this is my own opinion anything that is that heavily attacked okay in the news in the media in the scientific community being very ineffective and snake oil and it doesn work chances are it effective as are many inexpensive remedies that compete with big pharma so all i out do your own deep dive check with your doctor before implementing this but this is extremely interesting and it makes a lot of logical sense our body makes hydrogen peroxide it has been proven to penetrate the biofilms kill bacteria fungus yeast mold viruses and other microorganisms and then the byproduct of this hydrogen peroxide is water in oxygen in fact hydrogen peroxide is used as a signaling or communication molecule to tell the immune system to release interferon which is an immune chemical that interferes with the reproduction of viruses now as a little bit of a side note there are other things that help reduce biofilms as well like vitamin k1 okay and vitamin e but i protocols in one of the books you want to get eight percent food grade hydrogen peroxide and the most important thing you want to know is you never want to put straight concentrated hydrogen peroxide in your body at all it very toxic it corrosive so you don you percent food grade hydrogen peroxide into distilled water not tap water but distilled water and you may want to start out with three drops okay in this eight ounces of water for the first day and you times a day now on day two you want to add an additional drop so now you to four drops of this eight percent food grade hydrogen peroxide in this eight ounce glass of distilled water and you would do that three times a day and so each day you additional drop okay hydrogen peroxide into that eight glasses of water and you want to drink that three times a day until you hit day 21 where you stop now as you do this if for some reason you have a negative reaction okay let you want to stop what you while and you want to go really really slow you don reaction when you do this in fact i have done so many different cleanses in the past where i just kept going and i end up getting sick for two weeks because it created immune reaction and i had to wait two weeks for this whole thing to settle down so go real slow and this protocol is extra conservative right here but at the very least i wanted to introduce you to this concept and make you aware of what hydrogen peroxide can possibly do so you can do your research of course check with your doctor before implementing this but i was actually blown away about how much research that goes way back to 1920 and since we immune system the next best video for you to watch would be the one i did on the immune system check it out i put it up right here you	Success
You May NEVER Have Bloating Again after Watching This	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhRMjL7zaF8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now you may never have bloating after you watch this video now people do know that there bloating like beans legumes fruit sugars especially like lactose from milk too much fiber especially if you eat too much bran in other types of fibers and as a side note if someone has irritable bowel syndrome you should never ever ever give them bran that will just completely tear them up but let you eliminate a lot of the foods that cause bloating and you still have bloating okay then what now there something very fundamental that you need to understand to be able to get rid of bloating and that is this thing called bile bile is made by your liver it stored in the gallbladder and it has three main purposes and I give you a really good demo to help you understand bile bile is dishwashing detergent that is okay so we have some fat here and we have detergent we have soap so if we mix these together okay and we shake it up you can see it emulsifies now what does emulsify mean emulsify means to break down something into smaller droplets so when we add bile which is a detergent to Fat you get these smaller particles thereby increasing the surface size so your pancreas can release the lipase enzyme to break it down fully for it to be absorbed in the small intestine so the first purpose of bile is to help you absorb certain things in fats especially the important things like fat soluble vitamins vitamin A D E K1 K2 and other things like omega-3 fatty acids very very important so that number two bile helps you eliminate excess cholesterol in fact bile is the primary thing that regulates the amount of cholesterol because you have cholesterol that comes from the diet and you also have cholesterol that your body makes bile is there to make sure that it does not build up in the body and this is why one cause of high cholesterol or high lipids is really a bile deficiency and number three and this relates to your bloating bile is anti-microbial in other words it kills microbes that are in the small intestine normally you should not have a lot of microbes in the small intestine especially the microbes that make certain gases like hydrogen and methane when you have too much hydrogen or methane you bloating and that is called small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and what that is when people had their gallbladders removed the studies showed that their risk for getting small intestinal bacterial overgrowth goes up now there occurs when you don you get undigested fat that tends to accumulate in the small intestine and now that forces the intestine to try to digest it and so we have this decreased transient time right because it going through very easily and that alone is another cause of bloating because you and on top of that bile helps to lubricate the colon and this is why not having enough bile could cause constipation and having too much bile can give you diarrhea so when people get bloating they usually take some medication they might take some enzymes they might take a probiotic or maybe even some type of a medication that takes a spasm out but what they really need is bile salts and so if you interested in a really good product that not only has purified bile salts but also has additional things like enzymes things to acidify the stomach herbs to help thin the bile so as you can see bile is so essential for your digestion and it which is not an extra organ that they might tell you that you really don need and so whether you have your gallbladder removed or you just have a deficiency in bile all sorts of things can happen in addition to having bloating as well and so I give you some additional information on that right here what are the symptoms of low bile well you can develop hypothyroidism why because you need bile to help convert T4 to T3 the active form of the thyroid hormone and if there anything going on with the liver whether you have a fatty liver or it with scar tissue you may find that you might not get this conversion from T4 to T3 on the flip side let thyroid is in a hyper State you have Graves it moving too fast that would be one contraindication that you don give the person bile salts because it going to speed up the thyroid a little bit more if the real cause is a deficiency of bile and that covering all these symptoms right here because if you is my problem with bloating a lack of bile you probably have other symptoms that relate to that okay next one is greasy stool you might leave skid marks in your toilet why because there fat there this fat that digested your stool actually could float if you have too much fat in it that would be an indication of low bile and a couple others that number one the stool color is a pale or even gray that could be a severe bile deficiency another one is you satisfied after you eat why because you can soluble nutrients that are supposed to satisfy you so even though the food might be nutrient dense it about you not absorbing those nutrients all right we already covered bloating we covered sibo and next one is right-sided discomfort and I right rib cage right through here you have your small intestine right here you have your gallbladder right here and that can refer up to the right uh trap right here or back into the rhomboid on the right side it can come up all through here because there nerve from your gallbladder to the diaphragm to all the way up through here okay and then we have high cholesterol I already talked about that gallstones okay what is gallstones that is a super concentrated cholesterol situation where the cholesterol is turning into crystals why it you supposed to break up and eliminate this extra cholesterol all right next one fat soluble vitamin deficiencies like a vitamin A deficiency you notice that with your vision at night driving it might notice with your skin and low vitamin D that could show up in a lot of different ways low back pain inflammation um you get sick easily you can also have a vitamin E deficiency that can show up in a lot of things too it can show up in weak muscles after you exercise it taking you way too long to recovery your Skin could be you bleed easily now if it vitamin K2 you might get calcium buildup on your teeth is tartar or in the joints and the last symptom would be omega-3 fatty acid deficiency so you know people take cod liver oil fish oil to get this omega-3 and it just important for your heart health it and mood and it so even though you regular basis the problem could be you don all right let a bile deficiency situation well having your gallbladder out is the obvious one because now we have no way of storing that bile between meals what we have is we have a tube from your liver that into the small intestine and it kind of trickling through we don any ability to regulate it but I will say this that there have been a lot of reports that people tend to grow back uh their gallbladder and even remnants of a gallbladder Okay so that able to grow it back if you had yours removed and I that all right low-fat diets when you go on a diet that saturated fat there stimulate the the bile production or the gallbladder contraction so that another cause of a deficiency of bile and this is why vegans have a higher tendency to have gallstones because they don not eating saturated fats or animal products antibiotics now why would an antibiotic cause a low bile situation well guess what there your liver that gallbladder and you have secondary bile that is produced from your microbiome in your gut so if you don have that you can secondary bile that you also need to help out with the situation and this explains why diarrhea can also cause a loss of this microflora and then you can end up with a loss of bile from that as well and that triggers another thought let colon cleansing right colon hydrotherapy where you waste from your body well you better put those microbes back and you may need to add some bile salts because if you removing a lot of the microbes from your gut you deficient in the microbes you to be deficient in the biome that they produce a couple other points high estrogen whether the person control pills from a replacement therapy or they just had a baby and this is why pregnancy can increase the risk of gallstones because of this estrogen situation and how it affects the liver high amounts of insulin okay that comes from eating a lot of carbs and frequent eating can diminish your bile Reserves High cortisol especially if it medication like prednisone that can really mess up your gallbladder your liver as well as the production of bile and then too much omega-6 fats those are the unsaturated fats that are very inflammatory can really throw off your bile reserve and then having a fatted liver it could be even an inflamed liver or even a liver that cirrhosis why because your bile is made from your liver and if there the liver you can all right what list well make sure you have enough fat in your diet I not the omega-6 have omega-3 have enough saturated fats to trigger this process don have to spike the fats tremendously but just just don foods that help build up your gut Flora like fermented sauerkraut for example number three intermittent fasting can greatly help because first of all you lowering insulin secondly you allowing the body to reset and build up this concentrated bile in your gallbladder if you frequently your gallbladder might not have a chance to really build up the concentration that it needs to do its magic on your food of extracting these fat soluble nutrients and number four low carb which is going to lower the insulin and number five taking purified bile salts you after a meal you might want to take one or two and sometimes three and that can greatly assist you in building up your bile reserve and if you want a really good bile salt product I put my recommendation down in the description	Success
Top Diseases That Are REALLY Nutrient Deficiencies	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHay5kYhU1s	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let that are in reality nutritional deficiencies is it possible that certain diseases could really be just nutritional deficiencies well that going to talk about you know when you go to the doctor with your disease there not a lot of deep dive into vitamin or mineral deficiencies at all that you have anemia they might look at iron or even b12 but typically they looking for nutrient deficiencies in fact from my experience they don really look at the cause for any of these conditions it making sure that they correctly diagnose you and then jump right into the treatment but let couple things there children worldwide that have a severe vitamin a deficiency which makes them prone to blindness so without enough vitamin a you can very easily develop all sorts of diseases not just with your eyes but with your immune system with your skin you can have acne dermatitis all sorts of things now let vitamin e if you don vitamin e in your body what suffers is the inside of the arteries vitamin e is one of the main antioxidants that helps prevent lesions and inflammation in the inside of the artery and so a lack of e could set you up for a whole cascade of issues we start building up calcium deposits or cholesterol deposits and the artery becomes plug it all starts with the lesion that can occur because you don have enough vitamin e to protect the inside of the arteries also without enough vitamin e the heart muscle itself can lose oxygen and you can be at risk for angina which is chest pain this is why vitamin e is good for anything muscular and they call vitamin e the natural nitroglycerin because nitroglycerin is what they use to stop heart attacks all right vitamin d can a lack of vitamin d cause a disease the answer is yes osteoporosis or osteopenia which is a pre-osteoporosis state you can even have osteomalacia which is softening of the bones a lack of vitamin d can set you up for an infection if you vitamin d you pressure unfortunately when you go to the doctor they recommend vitamin d if you have high blood pressure when it would be a good idea if they did that also in the past vitamin d was used for tb tuberculosis because it remedy they have found that patients with tb are nearly always deficient in vitamin d which sets the person up or makes them more susceptible or vulnerable to getting tb so it intimately involved with the disease process asthma is definitely associated with a vitamin d deficiency depression okay i people who were depressed that then increased their vitamin d that then we then we get to iron if you don your blood is not going to be able to carry oxygen we need iron as the key mineral to be able to carry oxygen in your hemoglobin and without it you going to get anemic so you can have a loss of your air you able to breathe that well you to be kind of pale tired then we have b12 you can develop another type of anemia from lacking b12 but there are a lot of other diseases that a lack of b12 will also create okay what about zinc if you don zinc a lot of things will happen you could develop dermatitis inflammation of the skin you could develop an infection because zinc is intimately involved with the function of your white blood cells and this is why so many people are taking zinc and vitamin d when they get an infection or when they recovery and overcome that infection also if you condition called hypogonadism okay so in other words the testicle shrinks and your testosterone goes down also you smell and you can even develop diarrhea i mean in certain countries there lot of small children that die from diarrhea because they now if you had high blood pressure the two really central key nutrients involved in that would be a lack of vitamin d and a lack of potassium the problem is when you test potassium in the blood you because the majority of potassium is inside the cell so you would have to know that and also do an intracellular potassium test and that would give you a lot of good information to see if you actually had a true potassium deficiency but so many people have high blood pressure because they just don potassium in the diet now the partner of potassium is magnesium right another mineral that is mostly located inside the cell that intracellular test but if you develop atrial fibrillation or some other type of arrhythmia now there are classical nutritional deficiencies that most people know about scurvy with vitamin c rickets with vitamin d pellegra which is a severe skin disorder with b3 and beriberi which is a neurological disorder now of course the thought is that we don major problems anymore maybe in certain countries that are very very poor but what about a sub clinical deficiency maybe the person doesn but let deficiency that they might not express all of this characteristics of this but just some can we actually create health without nutrients is it possible and the answer is no well on the flip side if nutrients are so involved in your health then a lack of them are going to be involved in the disease process this makes only logical sense let two things the foods that are recommended for a healthy body versus the foods that you really need to eat i commission if you haven this group you i researchers that want to do radical changes to your diet and it to one country it they want to have a planetary health diet by the year 2050 and they use all the buzzwords like it it well it a healthy body and i why they want to make your diet mostly grains 232 grams of grains every single day like corn and wheat and all the other grains potato cassava 50 grams okay vegetables 300 grams fruits 200 grams milk 250 grams and this right here meat 14 grams okay that would basically be one mouthful of meat okay talking about beef pork lamb things like that eggs 13 grams okay wow we the meat and eggs but you can have the fake meat and the soy burgers no problem okay legumes 75 grams nuts 50 grams and of course we can healthy diet without this right here sugar 31 grams that teaspoons now what is sustainable or healthy about adding sugar that question about now on top of all this what you need to know is there that legumes phytic acid is an acid in the fiber of these foods that bind certain minerals especially zinc iron calcium magnesium potassium okay and then we have oxalates okay oxalates are in the beans they vegetables they grains what do oxalis do they bind the calcium they make calcium unavailable we also have tannins in these foods right here also binding iron and other minerals as well as depleting vitamin b1 and of course the sugar you other videos it of b1 zinc potassium magnesium and calcium so the foods that they want you to eat just don be eating let nutrients that are involved in disease processes okay all right let with vitamin a where do you get vitamin a well you might say vegetables right there tons of vitamin a kale has vitamin a spinach is vitamin a well it really doesn of vitamin a retinol it that prevents blindness unfortunately they change the definition of vitamin a to include beta-carotene okay beta-carotene so when you see that vegetables have tons of vitamin a they about beta-carotene beta-carotene has to convert to retinol retinol is the thing that really is needed by the retina of your eye and so beta-carotene is good for other things but only three percent of it is converted to retinol the active form of vitamin a and take a while guess where you might get retinol from animal products okay meats egg yolk things like butter spinach and carrots might give you the precursor but it doesn of it anyway let it would take to get 9 000 micrograms of vitamin a and i about the retinol you can have three ounces of liver beef liver or you can do 40 pounds of raw carrots or 50 cups of cooked kale or 454 cups of raw kale so you can go ahead and pick which one you want to be able to get your vitamin a at your next meal all right let you probably hear that oh iron it spinach it the a different form that form okay there one is more biologically available the other one is not so the one that is very biologically available is the heme iron and that is only in animal products as far as non-heme iron as far as absorption you get between one and fifteen percent okay the heme iron you get 25 to 40 percent and then if we look at trying to get our iron from this diet with all of these things blocking iron i your body at all what about b12 only in animal products okay now what about zinc do you get the same amount of zinc from plant versus animal and the answer is no the best bio-available form of zinc is in red meat it products it and fish and remember we have the anti-nutrients phytic acid that are going to bind that zinc with the whole grains legumes and even nuts what about this dha that fatty acid right well where do you get that that cod liver oil and i will say you can get it from algae if you want to eat algae okay but it fish now sometimes people will confuse a version of the omega-3 called ala with the active form of omega-3 called epa or dha so they might say that walnuts are are loaded with omega-3 fatty acids well walnuts have the um precursor it okay that has to turn into the epa which then has to turn into the dha so what is the conversion on that well ala to epa is like only eight percent and epa to dha is only zero to four percent so if you your omega-3 and you walnuts you bit but you but believe me i eat walnuts i love walnuts but i omega-3 fatty acids from walnuts and as a side note when you sprout the walnuts you can release and get rid of some of these anti-nutrients so that as well all right what about essential amino acids or complete amino acid profiles can you get them from grains can you get them from beans no not directly you and know how to do it but guess what when you consume meat fish eggs and organ meats you get all of the essential amino acids and all of your bio-available nutrients so over here you create nutritional deficiencies and over here you satisfy any deficiencies you have this is way more complete and way more bioavailable to your body now since we nutrition i think the best next video for you to watch would be relating to giving you more examples of these foods

The CURE for Procrastination	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH9aLk7WV0o	Dr. Eric Berg DC	someday when i have enough time and all the stars align and everything is just perfect then i professional procrastinator on steroids in college i said i i graduate then i graduated and i said i this went on and on and on today i want to talk a little bit about procrastination willpower and self-discipline you know i have interviewed a lot of people who have died in the past and i how much discipline and willpower these people actually had to be able to diet for weeks and months and years and just get a little bit of results and do it with a lot of cravings and a lot of fatigue and a lot of hunger i mean the tolerate those two things hunger and cravings over a long period of time is just remarkable so it is true that every time you diet you tend to slow your metabolism a little bit more and more and more especially if that diet involves low calorie and high carbohydrate dieting in general tends to go against survival right when you hungry your body should eat in your craving you should actually eat what you losing fat is anti-survival because fat is all about surviving your body does not like to give up fat it doesn to lose the storage of energy so every time a person tends to lose weight and not succeed it continue and do that same thing because it actually is not working and so a lot of times incorrectly they will label themselves as lazy a procrastinator or just that they have no willpower when in fact this is just not the case people are really not procrastinators they it what is true is they just been on the wrong program when you program and it about actually losing fat um you going to stick to it and so when you are on a program and it doesn have to step back and really make sure that you because what you truly understand how to get into fat burning um two things for sure will happen okay it may not be weight loss at first but it will definitely be these two things one is your cravings will go away and number two your appetite will go away you will no longer be hungry why because you are burning fat even when you relying on the calories from food externally you purpose of that fat fuel is the storage so you could exist between meals and not be hungry i mean just compare being on a diet okay with hunger and with cravings versus not having any cravings or hunger just think about how easy it would be now the question is why might you not lose weight if you correctly there principle and if you before it you but maybe you that is this you don get healthy you have to get healthy first before you lose the weight the health comes before the weight loss so the fact that you necessarily always equated to getting healthy let muscle loss that has to be healed and that takes some time let called insulin resistance which is really behind a slow metabolism that process does take some time to heal too but you have to realize that the fact that your cravings go away and your appetite goes away means it is working so all of this boils down to having a better understanding of how fat is burned and what to eat and what to do to trigger that and so if you are new to my channel in this information i put a link down below of a document that will show you exactly what to eat be able to achieve those two things rib cravings and rid hunger to make it easy to do and to get healthy to eventually lose the weight so many times procrastination is just a symptom of you don that the wrong diagnosis or someone else assigning you you always get worse with that so number two the next point i want to bring up is the problem with time um people that say well i just don have enough time to exercise or i don have enough time to implement the eating it takes or preparing for the meals to do this program well i propose that your real problem is you have too much time okay i don you okay i want to read it to you work expands so as to fill time available for its completion now what does that mean basically people adjust their pace through the workload and amount of time they have to finish it so in other words if you have a lot of time you may feel that with a lot of busy work there few corollaries i want to mention if you wait until the last minute it only takes a minute to do time is interesting because you we think that we just don if we really dissect a given day there a tremendous amount of effort done on things that are just a complete waste of time and i think naturally if we just stay busy we think we is it really productive time not necessarily so the couple things that i to overcome this lack of time problem so let implement exercise but you waiting until someday when you have the time which is probably never going to happen so this is what i recommend you do because a person will always if they have a certain amount of time they will automatically fill this vacuum with all sorts of things very similar to your house if you have extra rooms or extra spaces all of a sudden they become occupied with something the same thing happens with your time so this is what i do right as you plan out your day you have all these activities and generally speaking most people kind of weigh them on importance i would recommend taking the ones that relate to your health style specifically exercise eating correctly maybe preparing for those meals put those at the top of the list as the most important necessities don extra things that you if you have time put those at the top of the list in relationship to everything else so for example exercise the mindset you should have is i if i have any time left in the day i will do these other things like maybe i i more necessity that you create for these very specific goals that you tend to put off the more you get that done so this is going to take a lot of um ignoring um trivial things right and pushing those distractions to the side and really getting clarity on your goals okay with healthy eating with exercising or whatever you the more you get clarity and the more that you define why you want this thing the better you as me why i like exercise i like the feeling of having endurance the ability to go for a period of time i like the feeling of strength i like the feeling that exercise gives me after exercise not necessarily during the exercise some people in the exercise experience a tremendous amount of pain right it very painful for them and it extremely boring so they have to find something that is not boring something that is different that they do some type of dancing or some type of fitness that is they interested in some people exercise to lose weight and get fit to reshape their body and maybe they don that diet is responsible for 85 percent of the results and exercise is only 15 and their diet is not that great and so they without knowing that piece of data or they might not know what is really responsible for the stimulation of muscle growth and that so the way they not intensive enough it this moderate type of exercise where they have to do like 12 different sets it really uh get results because they don understand that it should be doing a different type of exercise and i down below so it is about having the correct information and this especially applies to our bodies but i don else is doing because usually that is incorrect information i like to study those people that are very successful in certain things and not necessarily study or follow what mainstream or conventional is doing because i find usually the truth is in the opposite direction so anyway i wanted to sort out in this video a couple things that i think will help you overcome procrastination and increase your discipline and give you more willpower now if you haven downloaded my new dr berg app i highly suggest you do it it watch all my videos all 6000 at any time you want just do a search on your cell phone for dr berg

The REAL Cause of Alzheimer's Is NOT Amyloid Plaque in the Brain	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB6CN3yzPws	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let some recent information that i want to share with you that debunks this idea of amyloid plaquing causing alzheimer whistleblower professor matthew shragg md phd who did a deep dive in analysis on a foundational research study that was done in 2006 linking that amyloid plaquing in your brain to alzheimer that all the funding and the studies after that was based on this study and if i actually injected this amyloid plaquing into the brains of animals and then they they got dementia so that was a study that a lot of research were looking for to be able to continue their research because so many studies at the time did not show positive improvement when they tried to lower plaquing or trying to block plaquing in the brain so in other words this theory of plaque causing alzheimer showed results and very unfortunately a lot of people are depending on research to come up with an answer a cure a solution for a long time and basically for decades they target a similar thing happened with this cholesterol you know being the bad guy this hyper focus on cholesterol is the root of your heart problems has been going on since the 50s all based on some research in the 50s where they selectively omitted certain information out of that study which gave you the different conclusion that cholesterol was bad and of course it also happened with this theory of depression being a chemical imbalance they recently found that there evidence showing that people who are depressed have a chemical imbalance the very foundation that all these drugs are based on now before i get into what i believe is causing this problem let symptoms of alzheimer problem remembering recent events okay you also have a problem trying to find words you have an issue with spatial location trying to navigate through town without a gps is very difficult and this relates to a part of the brain called the hippocampus which is um all about trying to locate yourself in in space and that with alzheimer to shrink you also tend to get a loss of smell and also mood swings so to figure this problem out we have to first look at what we truly know okay well we do know in alzheimer brain does shrink and it starts off with the hippocampus we also know that people who are getting alzheimer younger and younger people who are 45 years old even people in their 30s and even 20s are getting alzheimer is insane they also have found a high correlation between hyperinsulinemia high insulin and insulin resistance and alzheimer they found that treating amyloid plaquing just doesn produce results it they also talk about a risk factor involving apoe which i get into in this video but all you really need to know is that this is related to ldl which by the way is increased with this right here hyperinsulinemia and i this in a bit but what i did is i started looking at alternative theories to alzheimer and i looked through a lot of data and i spent a lot of time with dead ends until i found an alternative theory that just makes a lot of sense because there that aligns with this theory and this alternative theory is based on that alzheimer problem now what is a lysosome storage problem it cell that helps you recycle and clean up garbage so you have these lysosomes in your cells you have them in your neurons so apparently the garbage disposal recycler mechanism is broken i mean if you had no way of getting rid of your trash in your house and it started building up it would eventually leave your house unlivable okay because the garbage the toxicity well that with alzheimer lysosome which is the garbage disposal recycler in your cells you have the old damaged stuff garbage protein damaged proteins goes through this little mechanism there and acids that are dissolving and breaking things down okay and it spits out on the other side these renewed building blocks so your body can be very efficient and build new cells this whole process is called autophagy so autophagy is a condition in your body where you question is is there any data that backs this theory up and the answer is yes it just so happens there mutation with a gene psen which if there that gene you problem getting rid of the junk out of your cells okay and apparently the mutation of this gene has for a long time been known to cause alzheimer that aligns with this theory as well there i below which involves enhancing the function of your lysosomes okay there are certain drugs that can be used to help improve or enhance this function of the lysosome and so these are the two drugs right here and this one decreases neurodegeneration and this drug right here enhances neurogenesis they rebuilding the creation of new neurons now there are there any studies that link autophagy to alzheimer there is there these studies it shows that alzheimer is a problem with autophagy and then the question is what would trigger autophagy well this is where i now but you have to realize that the most potent thing to trigger autophagy is fasting and there amount of research showing that fasting improves alzheimer factors align with this theory so to date i think this right here is the most likely real cause of alzheimer right so next question is of course for those people that don like to take drugs because they effects are there any natural versions of these drugs that could potentially enhance the lysosome well yes there are a lot of things you can do to enhance the lysosome function as well as autophagy and the first thing you should know is what will induce autophagy is the lowering of glucose that trigger so what does this lower glucose thing mean it means low carb no sugar okay so the ketogenic diet that would be number one number two fasting i already mentioned this if i personally had alzheimer alzheimer i would get them well she fasting but i would get them on omad one meal a day and every single week i would do a 48-hour fast well you might be saying what if the person know that would much rather have someone too thin or myself be too thin then get alzheimer had alzheimer assisted living home where she was and it was devastating to see all these people with alzheimer and their spouses coming to visit them sitting with them trying to communicate with them in fact that devastating things that can happen to a loved one alzheimer lose your ability to think communicate and this is tragic and of course when i was there and i was watching what they were feeding them it was snacks between meals it was pure carbohydrates all right number three i looked up and found some fascinating research on how you can use certain herbs that have effects that enhance the lysosome as well as increasing autophagy and the number one thing that i found is curcumin that comes from turmeric amazing properties not just for improving your cognitive function i mean it specifically improves and enhances the lysosome which is fascinating number two pine bark specifically pycnogenol in pine bark has certain properties that can help enhance the lysosome we also have the herb thunder god vine and green tea extract okay specifically egcg has significant effects of increasing autophagy omega-3 fatty acids specifically dha has great effects increasing autophagy i also found data on small chain fatty acids increased autophagy as well and you get small chain fatty acids from your microbes your microbes make these fatty acids from the fiber you eat i like salads so that fiber hits the microbiome and then they make these small chain fatty acids which are very similar in chemistry to ketones so going on the ketogenic diet reducing glucose and also increasing these right here increasing ketosis is the beneficial thing exercise is also another significant inducer of autophagy so we want to include that and then we have sleep cruciferous vegetables certain phytonutrients in extra virgin olive oil make sure you get the real stuff and lastly heat and cold therapy so in summary alzheimer about getting rid of plaque it that accumulates in the lysosome and you do that by enhancing autophagy and there to a loved one or a friend that you know but it this information right away for yourself and your friends and family to prevent alzheimer want to learn how to do fasting i put this video up right here check it out	Success
The BEST Homemade Toothpaste (Only 4 Ingredients)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9hOOqgbuNM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now if you toothpaste in the hopes that it will clean your teeth make your breath fresh you might want to think twice in order for this to make sense i first need to explain what your spit is made out of okay your saliva you produce a tremendous amount of saliva every day it milliliters that ounces of saliva every single day now what electrolytes trillions of bacteria you have an enzyme to help you break down starches you have a protein that helps coat vitamin b12 so that it can pass through the stomach and get absorbed into the small intestine there to keep everything flowing then you have sodium bicarbonate that is baking soda so the glands in your mouth actually make baking soda to help neutralize the acids that are occurring in the fermentation process when you feed your microbes in your mouth too much sugar as well as the candida there this byproduct of a certain acid and that ph is important because if the acid is too acidic you saliva there cells there specifically anti-pathogenic factors and it not to disturb the chemistry of what in that saliva because if it altered to one way you start getting inflammation in your gum as gingivitis or periodontal disease you start developing cavities you start getting an overgrowth of yeast or candida on your tongue you start developing bad breath chronic calitosis and you can even develop biofilms which are microbial colonies in slime and calcium in your tonsils so i hope now you understand the importance of the saliva and what it doing to help clean your mouth and keep your breath fresh and prevent all these other diseases that can happen in your mouth so think about this here you use commercial toothpaste right what commercial toothpaste well you have fluoride which is very harmful to both good and bad bacteria you also have triclosan well actually they just banned it that endocrine disruptor which creates resistance to certain bacteria and then they put sodium lauryl sulfate the same stuff in your shampoo they put that in your toothpaste like a lathering or a foaming type cleaning detergent which what do you think that does to your friendly microbes then you have propylene glycol the same stuff they put in antifreeze they put that in your toothpaste which is a solvent which can also contain something called dioxin which is a carcinogen in fact sodium lauryl sulfate can also contain dioxin as well which like i said is a carcinogen and on top of everything let artificial flavoring in there some artificial coloring some parabens which are endocrine disruptors chemicals that eventually turn into formaldehyde and in the icing and the cake let carrageenan in there which creates inflammation in your gut here you are thinking you good by using this commercial toothpaste when in fact it microbiome and the chemistry of your saliva so i want to give you a very simple four ingredient recipe to make your own toothpaste which is very inexpensive and that has absolutely no side effects and will give you nothing bad or negative it saliva you start off with one teaspoon of coconut oil okay then you add a half of a teaspoon of baking soda then you add a fourth of a teaspoon of hydrogen peroxide food grade three percent don then you simply add three drops of one of those oils okay it could be clove cinnamon you could also use oregano oil of course the scent might taste like a pizza but i think these other ones are really really beneficial so this is a slight modification of another recipe i gave in this video on how to prevent plaquing check it out i just put it up right here	Success
The 10 WARNING Signs of Dementia	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Yd1EEWMBA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we warning signs of dementia specifically Alzheimer very important information to share with you that relates to your genetics for example if your grandparents or your parents had it does that mean you going to have it I on some important information relating to the actual cause of Alzheimer um there on the amyloid plaque theory that is completely going to flip things upside down but before I touch on the warning signs I just have to say out of all the stresses that someone experiences a loss of a loved one a loss of your mother with Alzheimer is probably one of the most devastating things that can happen not just for you but for them as well because you situation where you yourself and you to think and remember and locate things and navigate so it unstabling it basically terrifying my wife had Alzheimer to her mom I mean it was her best friend and it was just tragic to go to the nursing home and visit her you see all these family members trying to communicate and trying to connect with this person that they love I mean to this day that Karen just you know misses her and she thinks about her um all the time so today I talk about the warning signs and I going to give you some things that you can do to hopefully reverse the situation in a loved one and even in yourself okay so with that let with the warning signs first the first warning sign is a change in language okay uh coping for different words trying to look for different words that you can go through this it doesn have Alzheimer many other reasons it could be you haven sugars it could be a B12 deficiency it could be many different things but these are just potential indicators that there could be a problem in this area when we talk about a problem with language we also talk about communication there problems with communicating to the person they attention and then when they talk to you it could be kind of random and and for example you might ask them a question and you know a few minutes later you might get the answer so there time it takes a long time to sink in and to get a response number two navigation difficulty finding yourself around uh town uh around your house things like that so unfortunately over time that can get really bad to the point where you just basically lost all the time number three sensory so you might have a loss of taste smell hearing sight and before constipation what that is my mother-in-law was on a stool softener right so realize constipation is part of the gut and there brain connection there that sensors a two-way uh communication Street one area can affect the other all right number five personality changes okay they weren personality is completely altered when you have Dementia or Alzheimer six mood changes and this can also occur because of the frustration that they know where they difficult to get certain words out and remember different things it can be very frustrating so that important not to correct someone if they make a mistake with words or anything because that not only frustrates them but it can actually make it worse if you even if they don dementia you basically kind of lock it in where they start to do it more and more and more all right number seven memories locating pictures and thoughts that you had before are difficult especially recent memories okay that could be one of the indicators number eight thinking the ability to solve problems now solving problems also involve having a memory of past similar situations that you you can difficult to solve problems so if someone can they problems built up and that more frustrating all right number nine their overall awareness is affected so you can kind of even look in their eyes and see that they percent there they attention is not on the environment in the present it number 10 they keep repeating themselves so they might have no idea that they just said something twice so again if they do that don them because that move on and just ignore it now there some recent information I want to share with you and I down below of a video that I did on this topic and basically there was a researcher in 2006 that committed fraud on this area of Alzheimer fabricated data that wasn this related to amyloid plaquin causing Alzheimer even people without Alzheimer plaquing and they don and so all the research money that is went to this Theory okay and this has not been fruitful I mean I like millions and millions of dollars and so now that cast a huge doubt on the actual cause of Alzheimer theories about Alzheimer lot of sense and I did a whole video on it and that relates to the lysosome and what little part of the cell that like the garbage disposal okay and so that part of the cell becomes dysfunctional in Alzheimer cannot uh get rid of the garbage so the garbage keeps backing up you can imagine in your house if you never took out the garbage okay what would happen over a period of time it toxic and that with the neurons and there data I want to share with you on this lysosome uh this angle of the cause of Alzheimer look at all the factors that align with that it all makes total sense what happens in the lysosome is a condition called autophagy and autophagy is the recycling of you know garbage to get fuel in the body and also to get new cells and so I little plan to give you to show you how to improve autophagy but the current theory that makes the most sense with the cause of Alzheimer dysfunctional autophagy or lysosome situation you know there about this that there genes that will cause Alzheimer since Alzheimer there and multiple causes there could be multiple genes that you can have mutations with that can cause this problem let me explain like for example mini strokes that can create a type of Alzheimer there brain injury from some other cause and then there have a problem with um methylation and without trying to get too complex basically if you have a problem with methylation you lot of heavy metals in the brain and that could be aluminum or even lead or even iron and that can create Alzheimer causes you have related genes that are involved with those causes and so recently A lot of people are getting their DNA tested and knowing your DNA as far as what mutations you have it doesn going to have that problem it just tells you have weaknesses within the genes so I think it but also know if one of your grandparents had this problem or your parents had it potentially you could have a weakness within your genetics which doesn it it just means that that Gene could turn on at a certain point in your life and then you could get it but there are so many things you can do to bulletproof yourself to make sure that Gene stays off and that about so there are a number of genes that I not going to kind of give you all the complexity but I of the genes it Gene has to do with turning on late stage Alzheimer get after age 65 but there forms of that Gene okay so you have the E2 version which helps protect against Alzheimer version which is different if you have a problem with that Gene it will increase your risk of getting Alzheimer to 25 percent okay and then you have another version of this APO e Gene which is the E3 version which will not have any effect on Alzheimer if you get your DNA tested and you have a problem with that Gene um specifically like E2 or E4 then it just tells you you need to be doing things to bulletproof yourself right now now there Gene called app that has a lot to do with what I said before on autophagy which is that lysosome cleaning up all the garbage in the cell if you have a problem with that then you need to be doing a lot more autophagy and strengthening the cleaning out process because you have a problem with detoxification if you don things the cells become very very toxic and then there the methylation and I a little bit but if you have a problem with that Gene what you need to do to solve it is to take larger amounts of B12 not the synthetic version but the natural version as well as the natural version of folic so what happens if you don you okay you detoxifying Mercury so this tells us you shouldn fish okay this tells us that you should be very careful about taking too much iron especially iron in synthetic supplements especially iron in enriched flour products so understanding the weaknesses that you have can give you a lot of um Power in doing something about it because now you links are now another heavy metal would be aluminum right and of course the aluminum deodorants and aluminum pans should be avoided so now the question is okay and I summarize this for you to make it really simple um let all of these genes okay that relate to Dementia or Alzheimer and this would be good for any person with Alzheimer and actions you can take that are epigenetic actions which are lifestyle actions that can help you control your genes just because a gene is mutated doesn with it okay so these genetic factors will keep things in check okay number one is to change the fuel that they running on to the ketones okay you want to run the brain on ketones the brain loves ketones it I ketones and the way you do that is putting the person on a low carb diet as well as doing intermittent fasting okay both of those will induce ketones and it will support the brain even if there damage to the brain because the first thing to go downhill with Alzheimer damage to the hippocampus the nipple campus is all about navigation memory and things like that so a ketone fuel will bypass the damage feed the neurons directly because because at the heart of the matter is a shrinking brain a brain that neurons that don and so they feed them ketones we will instantly see at least some good Improvement all right number two you want to induce autophagy autophagy is not some cellular thing it into so they can recycle garbage okay and damaged proteins and the most potent way to stimulate autophagy is with fasting okay regular intermittent fasting with periodic prolonged fasting but you can also induce autophagy with exercise so you don a gym exercise you can be exercising at your home doing a mild version of it you know stretching things like that but any exercise is better than no exercise the next thing is green tea these phytonutrient treat it in green tea e g c g can greatly help you and also induce autophagy curcumin is another really good natural phytonutrient in turmeric that can help induce autophagy number three omega-3 fatty acids specifically the EPA and the DHA which your brain desperately needs and I would recommend getting it from cod liver oil make sure if you getting your omega-3 from fish that you do the least amount of heavy metals or Mercury is possible because what we trying to do is we eliminate all these extra things that can create problems and that would be number four reduce heavy metals okay so you fish that you can eat and one fish you can helps reduce Mercury so if you do have fish maybe you take selenium at the same time to lock up that mercury so it doesn is something I would also recommend unfortunately this might be a pain but to get one of those distillers where you have stainless steel okay and not the plastic jug but glass and you can make your own distilled water and consume a good amount of the water being distilled water why because you have to realize what is in tap water I mean even like even builted water there sorts of chemicals when you distill it you remove everything and so it really good way of drinking pure water without the heavy metals as well as pulling out metals from your body okay it put the minerals that you want back in so that make sure you don that are synthetic because a lot of times it has the wrong type of iron and that can really mess with all sorts of things because we don synthetic vitamins and we don these Elemental minerals from supplements so it has to be really like food based or plant-based type nutrition not food I supplements themselves make sure that they five methylation I mentioned on that B12 okay you need a lot more B12 you can get a supplement with B12 and folate if you have this problem and so there simple genetic test to see if you have a problem with methylation okay but then the solution is simple B12 and folate number six medications okay if your loved one is on medications you need to work with the doctor to get them off because even with my mother-in-law we found that she was on incontinence medication and she was on all these things that had side effects of memory loss so once we made those changes she did a lot better okay I didn the problem but it improved the problem then we have number seven vitamins now these specific vitamins have a direct effect over your genes okay so we have vitamin A I beta-carotene the precursor I about actual retinol from things like liver and egg yolk cheese things like that then we have vitamin D which will improve things like inflammation in your brain and then there the synthetic version make sure it from natural sources like nutritional yeast B1 is probably the most important vitamin for the hippocampus which is the first area of the brain to shrink when you have dementia vitamin C if you take an Alzheimer always deficient in vitamin C so vitamin C is really important too I would not get this synthetic version I would get a food base or just eat foods high in vitamin C the top vitamin C Food believe it or not is sauerkraut vitamin E very powerful antioxidant not just good for the heart very good for your brain especially the structures of the brain that relay uh you know memories things like that and then we have vitamin K1 and this is interesting because people were on like kumichin drugs which basically block vitamin K1 have a higher risk of getting alzheimer you get a lot about vitamin K1 from dark leafy green vegetables and then number eight lion and it even has regenerative properties for brain tissue as well as neural protective properties as well but a lot of people have dementia report amazing changes when they take lion mane now if you haven Alzheimer the amyloid plaque not being the cause for it you should definitely check that one out next very important I put it right

13 Signs Your Body is Deficient in Nutrients	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we signs that your body is deficient in your nutrients a deficiency of nutrients doesn consuming this from your diet there other reasons why you might be deficient one would be lacking your stomach acid you don absorb minerals that well because certain minerals need a certain pH to be absorbed especially things like calcium and iron another way to be deficient is there problem with your gallbladder or you don deficient in bile so then it doesn matter how many fat soluble vitamins you take like vitamin A d d k without that bio it can reason why people are deficient is they have damage in about lining that called a malabsorption problem and the surface area of your small intestine is just not receiving nutrients maybe you had a history of a lot of antibiotics or some infection or you ate a lot of junk food but that small intestine is needed to absorb at least 90 percent of all your nutrients another reason why you might be deficient is that you refined carbohydrates or refined sugars or alcohol or you like for example metformin will deplete vitamin B12 and one other way you might become deficient is stress stress will deplete zinc be one calcium magnesium and many other nutrients all right that being said let sign I fibrocystic breast so there little cysts that are developing on the breast or the ovary that is the classic iodine deficiency when you iodine you don function of estrogen anymore without iodine estrogen can go too high creating cysts and other problems I mean you can even have cysts in the thyroid so iodine is a really good trace mineral to help regulate that level of estrogen and sea kelp is one of the best sources of iodine all right number two dry eye that is a classic vitamin A deficiency without vitamin A your mucous membranes dry up and this could also occur in your mouth you can add dry mouth or dry eyes the best source of vitamin A comes from animal product not planned all plants have the precursor to the active form of vitamin A called retinol so this carotene has to convert to retinol to actually have it work and unfortunately you only really get about a three percent conversion rate so if you consuming animal products you may easily get a vitamin A deficiency all right next one red cheeks okay like rosacea that is usually a digestive problem there your gut and that imbalance of microphone on your skin but as far as the nutrient deficiency that would be a lack of B vitamins because your microbes make the vitamins and B vitamins protect the skin especially vitamin B3 if you you problems from dermatitis to all inflammatory conditions and it acne all sorts of things but if you see someone with red cheeks suspect that there gut and they need to take the good probiotic or consume foods that have the naturally occurring microbes like sauerkraut or kimchi or even keep her all right the next one I about is a combination of three symptoms shortness of breath uh looking pale and fatigue this is classic anemia but the key nutrients to overcome anemia is iron but also B12 and folate There actual genetic condition this is another thing I forgot to mention the very beginning you can be deficient in a nutrient if you have a genetic mutation which nowadays they and they weaknesses within your DNA and there certain Gene that regulates activating folate and b12 and if there with that Gene you you unless you take larger amounts of the natural form of B12 as well as full length and this is a side note you can also be anemic if you have problems with your stomach because you don if you have some type of gut issue that you just can right number five Corkscrew hairs on your skin now what is that if you look closely sometimes you have to have a little magnifying glass on your skin and you see that these little hairs are going in like little Corkscrew shapes okay and there usually going to be a red dot where that the big symptoms of a vitamin C deficiency now the correlate that there as well like deleting gums like extreme petite and what chemistry of vitamin C is very similar to the chemistry of glucose sugar so if you are consuming glucose and vitamin C at the same time guess who the vitamin C and so you block the absorption of vitamin C so people that consume a lot of sugar usually are showing signs and then vitamin C deficiency but just remember the corkscrew little hairs on your skin it you highly recommend not to use the synthetic version of vitamin C aspic acid I would use a whole vitamin C complex that actually comes from like a food or an herb all right number six belly fat now this is not necessarily just a vitamin deficiency but there is a very common deficiency involved with belly fat you see belly fat occurs when the liver is fatty and you have this spill off of fat from the liver around the organs and your abdomen giving you this protruding effect so one really good way to get rid of fat off your liver is to start taking choline which is in the family of the B vitamins and of course do the ketogenic diet you can literally remove 50 of your fat off your liver within two weeks by doing a ketogenic diet all right so number seven if you someone chewing on ice plastic iron deficiency they need iron realize that there iron that called the bio of valuable iron ore iron from Animal product and then you have the non-hemean version of that which is more difficult to absorb in plants like for example spinach so if someone is just eating plants and not eating any animal products uh potentially they could have an iron deficiency and they may start chewing ice they also May develop anemia all right number eight scaling planking skin okay sometimes it sometimes it may be anywhere in the face the face could be slightly oily but there omega-3 fatty acid deficiency that person needs to start consuming more cognitive oil or fish oil and start to avoid omega-6 fatty acids which which is the corn oil the soil oil all these fried foods that they serve at restaurants all right number nine loss of taste or loss of smell is mostly a zinc deficiency it can also be related to a virus destroying nerves in your sinuses but if we nutrition it the best source of zinc is shellfish like oysters you can also get zinc from red meat as well as liver all right number 10. you have like this symmetrical skin rash that is in the lower legs or the hands or even a rash that looks like a necklace this is a pellegra symptom which is a B3 efficiency and if someone is consuming way too much corn corn products which actually is in a lot of foods corn chips and tortillas and even high fructose corn syrup you can develop a very severe B3 deficiency because there is virtually no B3 in corn so if you eat a lot of it you become deficient that nutrient and you start getting dermatitis but it symmetrical pattern of like your feet or your lower legs or your hands all right number 11. let swollen glassy tongue okay that is a B12 deficiency now again there factors with B12 like you can have a genetic mutation creating a problem with B12 you can have a problem with your stomach you can have a lack of hydrochloric acid you can have an issue with your small intestine you just don eat animal products because you can only get B12 from animal products all right number 12 numb or burning feet there B1 deficiency usually coming from either a high carbohydrate diet or the person a diabetic and this extra sugar is depleting B1 and then your body can make something called myelin that surrounds the nerves and you start getting weird neurological symptoms on the bottom of your foot it could be numbness like tingling burning or pain that is a B1 an efficiency what you need to do is take a powerful form of B1 in a fat soluble form called benphotamine and that will get rid of that symptom and then you well all right 13. if your eyes start Crossing it the muscle and you may see this more in younger children but it can also occur with someone who drinks a lot of alcohol or eats a lot of junk food because this is another an example of a B1 deficiency now if you like this video and you like to learn more about nutritional deficiencies I created a very popular video entitled 23 signs of your body is deficient in nutrients

Take 2 TABLESPOONS Before a Meal for GERD, Bloating, or Acid Reflux	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlQ0qEGujic	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now this is a really really important topic if you have Gerd acid reflux heartburn or bloating gas any digestive symptoms this video is very very important now one of the first things that people normally do when they have acid reflux is they go to their doctor and they get it evaluated and then they PPI or some type of antacid which suppresses the acid now at first it might seem logical you have this acid in your stomach we got to get rid of it right but the question is what causes acid reflux well if you look it up it say that acid reflux comes from the valve on the top of the stomach not closing properly all right well that cool but what causes that valve not to be able to close well they don know right and then my question is okay you how long am I going to be on this is it going to correct my problem what happens when I start the medication and come off are there rebound effects is it safe well for certain ppis uh long-term effects are really bad osteoporosis increased risk of cancer increased risk of gallstones increased risk of sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth increased risk of anemia increased risk of allergies and the list goes on and on so you always want to ask how long am I going to be on these beds for is it going to be indefinitely and what are the long-term problems and what is the underlying cause of the problem these are things that a lot of people don really ask and they don I recently talked to a lady who was on I mean she her early 30s and she medications right and she doesn well I mean how the heck are you going to know what is causing what what is creating different effects I mean I not against poison I but when you it making you not feel good but when we talking about ppis anything that suppresses the acid you really want to think twice before getting that medication but of course I need to give you a disclaimer check with your doctor before taking any of my advice so why don vinegar well mainly there in relationship to acid reflux or gerd using apple cider vinegar that reason who money to do a study because there a lot of profit in selling apple cider vinegar it drugs yes but outside of vinegar no now as far as myself being in practice for 30 years I had acid reflux who tried apple cider vinegar and got great results of course that personal observation that it really really works so we acid an apple cider vinegar okay it called acetic acid in fact these little bacteria acetic acid bacteria live on rapes they live on different foods especially when that grape becomes ripened okay and then when they make wine they sugar into alcohol but during that fermentation process they remove oxygen because one thing about the acetic acid bacteria is they can live with oxygen and that them but if you allow this fermentation process with the conversion from grapes into alcohol to get oxygen it eventually just turns right into vinegar now there things to know about the stomach so if you now because this is very important number one the normal pH of someone one and three that is extremely acid okay that that you have too much acid and your stomach uh what actually are they talking about I mean normal acid is that is acid as you can go like one to three so what does this mean someone has too much acid with acid reflux or gerd so acid reflux heartburn and gerd are really not a situation where you have too much acid you just have acid in the wrong place you have it in the esophagus the acid should be in the stomach okay so the real problem is that valve right well that problem a deeper problem is the pH in your stomach is not one to three it higher it acid as it should be and there sensing mechanism between the level of pH in the stomach and your valve on the top of the stomach they communication and so just think about it it meat or something you need all that acid right and you don flexing so that valve closes tightly if the acid reaches a certain pH you need it very very acid in the stomach and the valve will close so the real underlying cause behind gerd acid reflux and usually bloating okay and heartburn is that your strength of the acid the pH of the acid is not between one and three it might be higher four five six even seven the stuff in your stomach is not just acid you have other things you have an enzyme okay it enzyme and then it converts to an active enzyme pepsin is the active enzyme that gets activated with acid that powerful protein enzyme okay that of the purposes of your stomach is to digest protein you don enzyme up in your esophagus why because your esophagus is also a protein okay so it want that now what makes that enzyme active is the pH being acid okay very acid if that solution is to alkaline the enzyme will not become active it stays inactive so another question is what type of acid stimulates the active form of this enzyme peptase well does it have to be Hydrochloric like in your stomach well actually no it can be another acid it can be apple cider vinegar acetic acid because that acid has a very low PH okay now this also relates to some other data about the stomach having your stomach acid be between one and three also will help release bile okay now if you can and the gallbladder what happens is that you tend to get gallstones this is why one of the big side effects from antacids and ppis is gallstones now we have pepsin which is activated by acid but there pancreas enzymes that help you digest carbohydrates to digest fats so when you don acid in your stomach you less enzymes released from the pancreas and less digestion also you need this strong acid in your stomach to be able to absorb not just minerals but also trace minerals and vitamins as well so you become very nutrient deficient when you don stomach the other purpose of this acid is to kill pathogens coming in from the body as well as to kill bacteria so the bacteria doesn intestine and create a situation called small intestinal bacterial overgrowth where you have these microbes living in your small intestine and competing for nutrition from your your food and leaving you with a lot of problems especially bloating and gas and all sorts of issues now the other problem with not enough stomach acid is that you might get anemia because you can absorb iron and B12 adults there other thing that gets activated with this strong stomach acid it factor which I don into but just realize that if you don have enough stomach acid you going to be able to absorb B12 which can create all sorts of issues with not just anemia but a lot of neurological problems that can be irreversible okay in certain cases the other point about not having enough stomach acid is that can increase your risk of H pylori becoming a problem normally about 80 percent of the population has H pylori in their stomach but it doesn them unless you lose the stomach acid and then that microbe can then become pathogenic and create more issues okay so we don necessarily need hydrochloric acid to fix a lot of these issues you can use this very inexpensive apple cider vinegar the type of apple cider vinegar that I okay Braggs sold their company to another company and I found out they diluting their apple cider vinegar if you look in the back of the label they add water so it should be instead I recommend another company fairchilds okay it company I buy all my apple cider vinegar from that company and I also buy the apple cider vinegar for some of the animals that I they love it I dilute it with water and they is a really simple solution you get some organic apple cider vinegar okay and you just have to use two tablespoons in a glass of water it could be eight ounces it could be 12 ounces and you drink that before you eat okay that Simplicity of it that will help lower the ph it digestion you don apple cider vinegar without diluting it if you look at the problems of the apple cider vinegar it someone not diluting with water and drinking maybe a lot of it in there swishing around their mouth and it could affect their teeth so all you have to do is just take a straw and then sip it so it doesn fine now I also recommend other things too if you want to take it to the next level I would recommend going on omad one meal per day okay why because now you reset and heal because it eating and the frequent eating and all the snacks that really disrupts the digestive system and probably is one of the underlying cause to this GERD problem in the first place and then the last thing I would recommend is cabbage cabbage as a vegetable would be very very important in any type of acid reflux situation even ulcers it really helps the stomach I into why but you digest cabbage better than other greens and it will help you now just realize that you some weeks or months to fully correct it but you and of course I would also recommend a certain eating plan if you have this problem that would be called the healthy Keto Plan and I will put a link down below so you can download this eating plan now this other point I want to bring up is there a situation where your stomach is producing too much acid yes there is a condition okay but it very common the most common condition is something called hypochlorhydria that low stomach acid and one of the biggest triggers for that is just getting older so many people as they go into their 60s 70s 80s and 90s start just creating less acid and they start having all these issues with what I more rare condition would be too much acid and that does occur but usually from three situations okay number one zalinger Ellison uh syndrome basically that benign tumor in the stomach or small intestine and is causing the cells to produce too much acid basically another situation would be if you have autoimmune gastritis which is not as common so the parietal cells that are making the acid are being attacked by antibodies and then there compensatory situation where your body is going to compensate and make more acid until eventually you burn out that cell and now it much acid now you with no acid so you go from a hyper acid state to a hypo acid State okay and then the third situation for this sour stomach or is production of too much acid would be H pylori which I already covered and if you have H pylori which is kind of a pathogenic situation you want to take Mastic Gum garlic to try to kill it off broccoli Sprouts on a daily basis sulforaphane and broccoli Sprouts is a potent way to kill off or put this H pylori into a dormant stage now one very very important point if you you feel worse the burning increases it could mean that you have either inflammation in your stomach lining or in ulcer in which case you don cider vinegar right now you have to heal this ulcer or this inflammation and for that you want chlorophyll I recommend a high quality raw wheatgrass juice powder for that okay you take that and it does take some weeks to heal that area and then I also recommend the intermittent fasting for sure and the healthy version of the ketogenic plan as well as zinc carnosine very very important then after weeks of doing that when it then you can go back to the opposite of vinegar now another common remedy that people use is betaine hydrochloride that really just a no-brainer anyone has gerd anyone who has indigestion bloating acid reflux heartburn should definitely try the apple cider vinegar because it works so effectively now since we topic of digestion there know about it I have a really Dynamite video on digestion you have to check this one out and I put that one up right here	Success
The #1 Most Common Mineral Deficiency in the World	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I have a very interesting video today on the most common mineral deficiency in the world but before I dive in I just wanted to say thank you for subscribing just today I counted up the total number of subscribers on all languages because now my YouTube channel is translated into Arabic Russian Taiwanese and many other languages the total number of subscriptions is over 18 million subscribers 18 million I subscribing all right now that that out of the way what is the most common mineral deficiency on the planet well the answer is iron deficiency and this is a very interesting topic because it very common um it to simplify it and it to fix let me run down first the symptoms if you so number one you can have hair loss or hair thinning you can get arrhythmias your heart goes out of rhythm that could be an iron deficiency you become fatigue weakened you can get dark circles underneath your eyes restless leg syndrome okay I used to have that difficulty sleeping in fact the arrhythmias could keep you up as well you for coal old is very low your nails can become split very easily your concentration is terrible you can focus and you may experience a fibromyalgia or achiness in muscles or joints these set of symptoms can also mimic other problems like hypothyroidism a B12 deficiency a vitamin D deficiency low testosterone and even sleep apnea now one of the challenges that people run into when they if they have iron deficiency is they go to the doctor and sometimes their values their numbers are normal it shows normal iron it shows normal hemoglobin and the doctor might say well you but uh it deficiency when it could be so the thing you need to know about iron deficiency is there non-anemic iron deficiency so that could be like a pre-anemia type state so you might not have a severe deficiency of iron just it could be down somewhat so they call that subclinical now there diagnose an iron deficiency and that ferritin okay so let me just explain that what is ferritin ferritin is a group of proteins okay a lot of different proteins that help bind with iron and store and release iron so ferritin acts as a buffer if you have too much iron which is very very dangerous or you don so if your ferritin level is low that can definitely be more of an indicator that you however there create this false sense of higher levels of ferritin for example if you have an infection okay or you have inflammation in the body your ferritin levels will be higher than they should be so that can really complicate things and make things very difficult to diagnose anytime you also talk about an excessive iron so I going to touch on what to do if you have too much iron in the problems that could be associated with that as well as we go through this now I want to run into this next very interesting area which is why you might be deficient in the first place and there reasons but I just want to say that it more common to have non-anemic iron deficiency than to have anemia so it iron did not affect the blood yet but in fact a lot of other parts of your body and we need iron for other things than just building hemoglobin iron is needed to build thyroid hormones iron is needed to make dopamine iron is also needed for nerve impulses to work correctly that why you would have arrhythmias if you were deficient and so there different reasons why you need iron but I will say though I few patients who unfortunately did not find a doctor that can evaluate deep enough especially this iron problem and the worst thing a doctor can do is tell you it your head that is the wrong diagnosis when people have these symptoms and you talk about something that can really elevate your cortisol and piss you off but I hear it all the time so you really need to find a doctor that evaluator that can dig deep and to help assess different levels of this problem but I want to give you a lot of information to think with so you can sometimes even help your doctor guide them into a certain area especially the reason why you place so number one is that you consuming enough iron from your diet that can occur if you a vegetarian because the most available form of iron is the heme iron okay and that liver seafood Etc the type of iron you get from plants is non-heme and that is not easily absorbed in fact you less iron from plants like spinach but iron is also high in oxalates which can block the absorption of iron so let me go through the list so number one it could come from not consuming enough iron in your diet okay number two having inflammation in the body inflammation in any part of your digestive system whether it or in the intestines okay because if there ability to absorb iron goes down significantly all right the next one would be stress The more stress you have the more trauma that you have surgeries for example which is a trauma all these things can inhibit your ability to absorb iron also a loss of blood whether you donate blood or you have an ulcer or let know some type of polyp in your colon that you experiencing a loss of blood another common cause of low iron in your blood especially if you stomach acids okay if you don enough acid in your stomach you going to absorb iron and other minerals which is very very common it either hypochlorhydria or a or hydria and the way that you would know that you have low stomach acid is you have indigestion gas or even gerd heartburn or acid reflux or even menstruation another reason why you might be deficient in iron is you had a gastric bypass surgery okay that can cause the deficiency because you organs to absorb iron also athletes or people who exercise a lot can be deficient in Iron because some of the iron that you have is stored in the muscle and as you use your muscle you use up the iron and that could be one reason as well all right next one is antacids any medication that suppresses acids could cause an iron deficiency because we need that hydrochloric acid in the stomach to be able to absorb iron fibroids okay if you have fibroids that could be another reason why you deficient in Iron also having a greater need for iron like when you or your breastfeeding or even a young child in the development needs and requires more iron also people with eating disorders usually have an iron deficiency another thing that very common as far as blocking iron is phytic acid now that is in all the grains the soils the bread the pasta the cereal crackers biscuits waffles all of these grain carbohydrates have phytic acid especially the whole grains Okay so if you consume those foods that could be the reason why you Iron but phytic acid is also in lagoons beans as well as like I said grains now there in tea and coffee that can block iron as well so if you long and a lot of coffee you could be low in iron chocolate has certain polyphenols which are phytonutrients that can block iron and of course polyphenols are also in a lot of other things like turmeric for example so turmeric can actually lower your iron now I or tea or turmeric okay or even chocolate I awareness that that could contribute to a lessening amount of iron but if you consuming enough iron at the same time you red wine has polyphenols and even cannons that can block the absorption of iron all right another thing polymorphism what is that that something wrong with your genes there a mutation you can get a DNA test I got it done I because it information that can help you find your weaknesses within your genes so you can then do things about it you know and there epigenetic lifestyle things you can do with the diet or taking more of a certain nutrient so the reason I bringing that up is that I tested positive for this one called MTH fra slightly different one which does affect iron um so I um the genetic defect affecting this Gene called MTHFR it can cause you to have less iron as well as a B12 deficiency and a folate deficiency and as you may or may not know if you can also be anemic as well a different type of anemia and folate is very very important in building red blood cells the point is there are genetic weaknesses that uh go beyond just that Gene that can affect your ability to absorb iron and if you with working on all these other things and you don genetic uh weakness then you can go round and round and round so the solution if you have a mutation in your genes is just to take more and see if that doesn people don don changes because sometimes it could take months to fix a severe deficiency all right another Factor would be taking too much calcium or magnesium yeah or drinking a lot of milk calcium as well as magnesium can inhibit iron all right so I just want to bring that up also infections when you have infection your body will shut down the amount of iron available because this iron is kind of a competition between the pathogens and your microbes so your microbes no the pathogens can eat iron and your microbes also can eat iron so they will kind of hog the iron so the pathogen doesn can leave you in a situation where you have low iron so if you even have a let whether it whatever that could be why you iron and I already mentioned oxalates can block iron so oxalates are iron spinach almonds asparagus okay so I gave you a long list of all the reasons why you might be deficient in iron and then of course then you would correlate that with your blood tests to be able to see what an iron deficiency I know people will take supplements and they Elemental iron they types forms of iron and I that won recommend uh trying to get your iron from food first so start consuming more red meat liver shellfish okay and also try to identify why you if it apple cider vinegar or retain hydrochloride to help the pH so you want to get to the root cause and also if you add vitamin C at the same time like in a salad or sauerkraut you can increase the absorption of iron now one thing you could take as far as pills is take liver pills or another product there actually spleen pills you can get that dehydrated spleen extract that seems to work really good as an iron supplement now realize if you could take weeks to um correct this all right on the flip side let have a condition called hereditary hemochromatosis okay this is a situation where your body is absorbing too much iron so you have too much iron and this is the problem okay it could be very very toxic I can create problems with your liver in your heart and your brain So based on a blood test your doctor can determine if you have this a problem and now what you do about it well there couple things I would recommend start consuming distilled water I would get a machine to make your own and so it in a plastic jug but a glass jug coming from stainless steel because distilled water can start to actually suck out some of the minerals so just realize it but you can then put the minerals back in that you want but not the iron one okay turmeric turmeric can act as a chelator or something that binds that iron and can help pull it out of the body start consuming turmeric cocoa bean that can help because that has a lot of polyphenols that can help bind iron and definitely something like black tea would also help because it tannins which can help bind the iron so basically we want to take the things that are inhibiting iron if you deficient and start taking those because you have too much now there thing you could take I mentioned phytic acid right so you can actually take that as a supplement to help chelate iron or bind and remove iron from the body and you can get that in a form called ip6 okay it phytic acid and you start taking that to help bind the iron and if it problem and you want something stronger you can take something called EDTA that realize you have to put back in those minerals that your body really needs and they all right I gave you a lot of information about iron I think the next most important thing for you to learn more about would be on how to improve the digestive system simply because there are so many things that can go wrong in the digestive tract that can affect not just iron but other nutrients and I put that video up right here check it out	Success
Natural Solution for Plaque, Cavities, and Gingivitis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=950fbVKFwHM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I have a very important and interesting video on how to get rid of this Dental plaque tartar situation that you might have I did a video on this before but it wasn this would be like a part two because there add to this formula to get rid of plaque okay and this involves vitamin C now we have the vitamin C complex that in nature comes with a lot of different things one being a part of the vitamin C complex called ascorbic acid and many times you acid but it part of the vitamin C complex however you can use ascorbic acid in helping get rid of plaque but I want to First give you some background on vitamin C in relationship to oral health now you probably heard of scurvy which is a severe vitamin C deficiency and all the different effects that can be created Sailors at one time developed scurvy and they had a lot of problems because they basically were lacking any food with vitamin C and then over time they found that you can give a sailor limes lemons onions even potatoes to supply the vitamin C and that seemed to cure skirting so what is it about this vitamin that is so important well if you don make collagen okay vitamin C is essential to make collagen and I talking about collagen in your skin in your bone tissue including your teeth in your ligaments in your tendons in your muscles in your joints in all of your arteries including the capillaries so when you don example in your capillaries you get blood going through the capillary wall creating bleeding and so one of the big indicators to know that your vitamin C deficient is when you get bleeding gums anything like gingivitis or a periodontal disease is usually related in some way to a vitamin C deficiency now you probably already know that sugar is bad for your teeth and gums and so the sugar then feeds the bacteria that develop acids that cause cavities inflamed gum tissue and plucking and tartar so what actually is tartar tartar is biofilms okay what are colonies of microbes that have band together and they develop these calcium igloos or shelters to hide from your immune system so in nature like 90 to 95 percent of all these bacterias start to form biofilms in fact if you were to walk through a little stream for example you notice if you step on a rock it very slippery there formation of biofilms so in nature one of the defense mechanisms that these microbes use is these kind of a protective shell and so biofilms form tartar in your teeth they form the plaquing in your arteries also they form these calcium deposits in your joints so biofilms are around us everywhere and I do want to touch on the relationship between vitamin C and biofilms in just second but first let me just complete my thought on vitamin C and its function in your body without vitamin C you actually get really bad breath okay because you have this overgrowth of bacteria vitamin C suppresses pathogens including viruses bacteria yeast fungus mold and of course biofilms vitamin C also helps to act as an antihistamine so in the body when you have histamines it allergies and this is why vitamin C is good to take is to reduce the sneezing the runny nose the mucus production so vitamin C as I already mentioned is involved an essential in generating and making connective tissue and collagen vitamin C also tends to make active folate so in the pre-inactive form of folic acid that converts into folate vitamin C is necessary vitamin C is also a necessary in converting cholesterol into bile salts it in converting tryptophan into serotonin in converting dopamine into epinephrine so there lot of neurotransmitter type functions that vitamin C is involved with also making adrenal hormone steroids like cortisol you need Vitamin C and as you already know vitamin C is very important in fighting off an infection and decreasing the duration of how long you get an infection and also increasing your resistance to infection when you low in vitamin C you getting biofilms okay so another interesting point about this is that we know vitamin C saved the sailors but also there Sailors that I want to cover which is actually interesting the ships developing these things called Barnacles and these Barnacles underneath the ship would add tremendous amounts of weight and resistance when traveling through the sea and these Barnacles are basically collections of organisms um like even like clams and lobster and even smaller organisms with this calcium shell so if you have a ship with all these Barnacles you basically add like a third more fuel because of the weight and so there lot of problems and the name that they assigned to Barnacles would be called Marine following and so they lot of things to get rid of these these growth of these biofilms they try different paints with chemicals and of course all this is very toxic but in 1990 this guy who was a sailor had this brilliant idea why I was eating a sandwich with he had this uh Red Hot Chili Peppers in it and he had this idea that he said I wonder if these Chili Peppers would kill off these Barnacles right well he found out that they did effectively kill off these microorganisms so he developed a type of paint using Chili Peppers right and it worked great and there Chili Peppers Chili Peppers not only have certain active compounds that are going to kill biofilms but Chili Peppers are very very high in vitamin C and even one of the byproducts that vitamin C turns into is hydrogen peroxide which is another anti-biofilm chemical in fact your body even makes hydrogen peroxide to protect against too many biofilms which is another interesting point in my first video I gave you a formula that you can use when you help reduce plaquing tartar but I did not include vitamin C in this formula okay so I explain what I first ingredient to this new formula Edition which is only four ingredients would be to take uh one fourth of a teaspoon of baking soda and dissolve it in a half a cup of water okay warm water dissolve it completely and then add a fourth of a teaspoon of hydrogen peroxide three percent okay because hydrogen peroxide is a great mouthwash and a very powerful anti-biofilm compound but then I something else a fourth of a teaspoon of non-GMO ascorbic acid now all you going to be doing is you brushing your teeth with this um once a day and you out this material and you going to have one of the most powerful anti-biofilm compounds around but I recommend brushing your teeth all around inside and outside and then spitting it out and rinsing out your mouth now you can also add mints peppermint clove as a great essential oil to help as well and so it doesn leave your breath smelling a little bit better but on top of that just to understand What vitamin c does and the effects of vitamin C deficiency for oral health is huge you should be consuming things that are high in vitamin C on a regular basis and that would include several Foods Peppers both red peppers hot peppers mild peppers green peppers green vegetables okay pretty much all the green vegetables are low with vitamin C okay the next thing would be limes and lemons in your diet realize that if you lime juice in a glass or some container it very sensitive to oxygen and heat so there you of course fermented cabbage as sauerkraut has a ton of vitamin C all right so now that your more educated in vitamin C I really want you to understand the difference between natural vitamin C complex versus just the synthetic version of ascorbic acid this would be very very important for you to have the full picture so I created this video and put it up right here for you check it out	Success
The #1 Sign of Iodine Overload (TOXICITY)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Hm6ZRfAbes	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today let of iodine overload the symptoms from not having enough iodine are just as bad as getting too much iodine iodine is a trace mineral meaning that it in very small tiny amounts so we talking about micrograms not milligrams so the amount of iodine you need on a regular basis should be between 150 to 200 micrograms per day but you don supplement called potassium iodide which is meant to take as a protection against some type of nuclear radiation exposure and potassium iodide should not be taken on a regular basis as your iodine supplement now I will say that it common not to get enough iodine a lot of people are deficient than to get too much iodine but you should be aware of certain things that can happen if you take too much now since we are on the topic of iodine we should probably talk a little bit about Hashimoto is an autoimmune condition it hypothyroid condition it was discovered by a doctor out of Japan thus his last name Hashimoto name and by the way as a side note Japan has more Hashimoto other place in the world and I think because of this one point Hashimoto really not caused by an iodine deficiency but can be aggravated or even triggered with taking too much iodine and in Japan they do consume a tremendous amount of iodine from seaweed sea kelp seafood Etc but I do want to point out if you taking like 150 to 200 micrograms of iodine you trigger Hashimoto lot of iodine that you could potentially trigger it now if there triggers Hashimoto is the thyroid can start producing a lot of hydrogen peroxide and then hydrogen peroxide is a very very irritating and corrosive to the thyroid gland but normally our bodies have enough neutralizing factors to buffer that hydrogen peroxide and one being selenium which by the way selenium is really good for Hashimoto convert T4 to T3 which is the active form of the thyroid hormone but the selenium is also like a precursor to glutathione which is the liver antioxidant so probably what with Hashimoto where we don glutathione or we have a weak liver or even we have some problem in the gut that and if there situation or increase permeability in the gut because there that and this is why there association between things like gluten and Hashimoto know is that Hashimoto iodine deficiency and too much can actually trigger Hashimoto there just want to just briefly touch on with the Advent of DNA testing you can now get your DNA tested and find out where your weaknesses are and if there type of mutation in your genes it called a polymorphism you can also have a weakness or a higher risk factor of getting an autoimmune disease especially to your thyroid and that Hashimoto this gut issue you gluten and you could be much greater at risk for getting Hashimoto but I think also hypothyroidism could be a protective mechanism some type of compensation from having too much iodine that because too much iodine could be very damaging to the body all right now let dive into the number one symptom that someone would have relating to getting too much iodine okay the number one symptom is a highly irritable energy that keeps you from sleeping okay so let in this flight of flight mode and you just your body is just on edge and you just can the first signs that of an iodine excess now you could also have that symptom from other things like low B1 for example and being stressed because your adrenals in overdrive but just realize that too much iodine can activate the thyroid which can then activate too much sympathetic nervous system too much flutter fight and so that of the first signs that occurs with taking too much iodine here ones fast pulse rate okay like your pulse rate is just boom boom boom but again that can also come from other things like low potassium or low vitamin B1 another symptom of excess iodine could be atrophib or heart arrhythmias in general another one could be heat intolerance or diarrhea or hand tremors or your temperature is increasing but you don infection fever it just hotter or you could even have bone loss or osteopenia which is a pre-oscoporosis situation or another one would be a loss of menstrual cycle or excessive sweating or even and this is rare but you can have what these symptoms could potentially be you have too much iodine all right so what is someone going to do if they have symptoms of too much iodine well the most important thing is to find out where it eliminate iodine from your diet or your supplements okay so let me just kind of go through a list of sources of iodine now there mention related to getting too much iodine first of all maybe you way too much seek help or seaweed in your diet or you iodized salts or a tremendous amount of seafood or it could be a combination of several supplements you too much iodine so you want to read the back of the label and just start counting up how much iodine you really getting and if it micrograms you should start cutting back all right and the other question is um is there a blood test or some test to know if we have too much iodine okay well there videos I talked about a skin test where you can drop a little bit of iodine on your skin put a little patch on and then see if it gets absorbed or not over a period of time and that the problem with that test is it it really only tells you um recently what there do and that test is a urine test and if I test okay and I to see if you can just get this test ordered and you can send it right to your house but the test is a urinary collection test where you send your urine off to the lab and they measuring something called urinary iodine to creatinine ratio and when you get that test done you want it below a hundred micrograms per gram okay if it gram that means there iodine that you that high all right so that have Hashimoto videos on this but I wouldn instead I would take selenium okay now preferably you get it from your food and the food that has the highest selenium is Brazil nuts maybe you just take a couple of those per day that will be enough or you just get a supplement and only take what label so it because selenium is also a trace mineral so you just need sufficient amounts so if you have Hashimoto really key points here there more to know about it but I would definitely take selenium okay I would also take vitamin D very important vitamin D has been shown to decrease the antibodies in Hashimoto would recommend taking 20 to 30 000 IUS per day and lastly I would take a good natural source of B1 because B1 can also help if you notice a lot of these symptoms also cross over to almost mimicking a B1 deficiency and so these symptoms can be improved with B12 especially if you have this sympathetic nervous system dominance now also another hidden source which is probably not your situation is consuming a lot of Bakery Goods okay or breads or pastas things like that because a lot of times they use iodide as one of the dough conditioners which have something called iodate which is a form of iodine and another thing I want to bring up when you take um like purified bile salts okay which is in my gallbladder formula and where it lot of other products you bile or even a form of tadka if you have hyperthyroid symptoms just realize that can make things a little bit worse because that increases the conversion through the liver from T4 to T3 so that could be a really minor point but it can just contribute to this problem if you have too much iodine however if you need more iodine that would be a great thing to take because like I said before it more common to have a deficiency of iodine than it is to have too much iodine and also if you have Hashimoto I know have zero amounts of iodine your diet but just realize that you never want to correct these things necessarily with just a single element like a mineral realize that in nature it always comes in complexes so if you are deficient for example in iodine taking CCAP would be better than just taking a single iodine because in nature it never comes that way and if you do use a single mineral to correct something work with either your doctor or a health care practitioner to help get the levels just right because it bit complex and also realize that 80 percent of the conversion from T4 to T3 the active form of the thyroid hormone occurs through the liver and the kidney so if you have a thyroid problem and it the problem could be in your liver or it could be in your kidney that this problem so it thyroid issue now there book that I recommend if you have a thyroid problem or you want to get a lot more information about the thyroid gland itself it and she the thyroid the one I would recommend would be Hashimoto we I think it understand other factors that can affect the thyroid especially in the conversion factors from t E4 to T3 and for that information I put this video up right here check it out	Success
Low Potassium: Signs, Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--a-m_9gofI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we potassium okay the signs the symptoms the causes the treatment all the details about potassium I videos on potassium I my videos I I that are really really important and out of all the minerals I think potassium is at the top of the list as far as importance so the reason why we need potassium mainly is because it of a certain enzyme or a pump in all of your cells called the sodium and potassium pump okay that is a pump that keeps these two minerals separated to a certain degree to create a battery effect in your cells so potassium is intimately involved in the power in the cells and I generate energy for your nervous system primarily as well as your muscular system okay all your muscles and I just talking about your skeletal muscles from your legs and your arms but the muscles in your colon the muscles and the lung which is the diaphragm which is a little bit different but that skeletal muscle but it allows you to breathe so that important function right there it also is involved in PH and potassium also works with other minerals like sodium for example it can also work with magnesium and so in the diet for example if one is going too high the other one will also need to go up as well for example you don consuming too much sodium as long as your potassium is at least twice as high and so the average person needs like 4 700 milligrams of potassium and like half of that sodium ideally but that can increase if you but the average person is not consuming even close to what they really need of potassium and this is why this video is important because most people are deficient in potassium so you should know the symptoms you should know how you become deficient it from your diet but the medical term for low potassium is hypocalemia okay that means low potassium in your blood the thing you need to know with potassium is that 98 of all the potassium is located inside the cell only two percent is outside the cell in your blood so when you get a blood test you bit like two percent of all your potassium in your body so it best way to know what inside the body an intracellular potassium test is more difficult and sometimes it will do that so let the symptoms of low potassium okay number one would be muscle weakness okay let and you just so heavy or you exercise and you just don you just feel kind of tuckered out that could be a potassium deficiency this is why it might be good sometimes to take an electrolyte powder with potassium to get more energy while you a lot of times people will feel a significant difference with that now we also have your lungs which is controlled by the diaphragm so in other words a lack of potassium can affect your breathing right it a lack of potassium can affect the colon muscles the peristalsis the pumping action of your digestive system and that can show up as constipation as a symptom and also you can notice cramping in your calves in your feet in other parts of your body you can even notice twitching but also twitching could be a lack of calcium as well or even magnesium a lot of these minerals kind of cross over so cramps in your calf could be potassium it could be magnesium it could be calcium so this is why the video to kind of learn a little bit more about the overview of this one mineral another common symptom is arrhythmias the heart rhythm another one would be hypertension as in high blood pressure and even as that might relate to vascular stiffness in other words potassium helps keep the arteries soft okay to prevent high blood pressure so 90 of all hypertension is called essential which means unknown cause I think a good portion of that is either a potassium deficiency insulin resistance or a low vitamin D situation another symptom would be fatigue and then another one alkalosis you have a situation where potassium is intimately involved with helping regulate your pH so if your blood is a little bit too alkaline or too acid potassium is usually involved if the pH is more alkaline in your blood okay potassium is going to move from your blood more into the cell so you potassium potassium is also involved in the storage of sugar in your liver and in your muscles it if you you in this in the sugar itself it kind of gets stuck in the liver and the muscles it becomes unavailable to you unless you use up that sugar so um but that one way that you could become deficient in potassium another symptom would be insomnia um another symptom would be a higher pulse rate so potassium keeps your pulse rate lower and another condition called pulsatile tinnitus now what is that that is a situation where you start hearing your pulse beat okay it could be a swishing or a pounding where you put your head in the pillow and you just hear your heart beat just pounding like that it pulse rate you just hear or feel your heart rate okay that is a potassium deficiency all right so now the question is how do you become deficient in the first place it could be because you consuming foods high in potassium that a common cause and then also you eating a lot of junk foods which are loaded with sodium that really throws off your ratios another few common causes would be you like your vomit uh you excessive laxatives where you losing fluids or you have diarrhea that could be the reason why you in potassium another common thing is diuretics diuretics many times will pull out sodium and potassium stress in general can create a potassium deficiency and this is why a condition where you have high levels of cortisol called Cushing syndrome can give you signs of a potassium deficiency so by taking potassium you can feel calmer you can have more energy you can have more strength in your muscles you can have better bowel movements but like I mentioned before potassium is involved with storing sugar so one way to to deplete or shift the available potassium to the unavailable potassium is to eat a lot of sugar or refined carbs okay I have done that many times in my 20s in my 30s now and I sarcastic I consumed refined sugars in many many years but when I used to eat a lot of sugar I had a lot of these symptoms that we diabetics are usually always deficient in potassium and they should be consuming a good amount of potassium the higher their blood sugars are and so even potassium can help the insulin work better it can help the insulin resistance situation now when someone starts the ketogenic diet they lose a lot of glycogen since a lot of that potassium is stuck in that glycogen they potassium this is why when you ketogenic plant I always recommend take electrolytes to get back that potassium so you want to get heavy potassium definitely a good amount of sodium as well to get your electrolytes back drinking a tremendous amount of water forcing yourself to drink like a gallon of water can definitely do it as well when you recommend adding more potassium as well as sodium as in sea salts through the process that way you can keep your electrolytes up because you eating any food and so you need to be taking these nutrients because you don really store a lot of these electrolytes for a long period of time so if you doing prolonged fasting you could really end up with a potassium deficiency and feel faint and even pass out you know that electrolytes if you have low magnesium that can affect your potassium as well okay because they it takes a certain amount of magnesium to retain potassium and the last thing that can affect potassium is if you get injured or you go through surgery yeah and so that can shock the body it big source of stress and then you could just dump your potassium and end up with hypokalemia so what are the best foods to get your potassium what about a banana well a banana has a lot of sugar and it only has like 300 milligrams for a medium-sized banana you need 4 700 milligrams okay so a banana is not a good source of potassium what about potatoes well potato has a good amount of potassium but it also has all that starch unless you consume a raw potato which you would avoid potatoes too so these are the foods that are high in potassium at the top of the list you have beet leaves if you put those in your salad you have a lot of potassium you also have any type of leafy green is loaded with potassium the salads I need the cruciferous vegetables any of the leafy greens will give you enough potassium avocados are a very good source of potassium squash and lima beans have a good amount of potassium now of course lima beans are in the bean family I don of those if you have a small amount and we also have salmon has a good amount of potassium so potassium is not just in vegetables it also in certain Meats as well so I hope you now have a better understanding of ask him and a better appreciation of potassium if you haven on electrolytes that I did I have a very cool demo in this video to show you how potassium and other electrolytes can power your body check it out I put it up right here	Success
Recognizing the Signs of Kidney Disease: What You Need to Know	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu56EawudfU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we sign of kidney disease and actually this will surprise you you know the kidney is a filter and it converts blood into urine and it your body because it passive filter it does a lot it recycles all your fluids let don now for those people in Europe especially Dennis from Germany uh eight glasses of water per day is roughly about two liters and so if you drink eight cups or two liters of fluid a day you right throughout the day but think about this the amount of fluid that travels through your kidney in a given day is a 180 liters that there the kidney it because it recycles protein nutrients hormones it recycles like 99 of all the water that you drink and so we have this magical little filter that has all these sensors that coordinate the amount of fluid in your body that help you convert vitamin D into the active form of vitamin D to help regulate your blood pressure and the hydration of your body and the elimination of toxins and drugs if you really appreciate what that nephron the filter of your kidney does for you you probably are going to think twice about eating junk food or or consuming things that might harm the kidney because it average person has between one million to 1.5 million of these little filters they start developing kidney disease the amount of nephrons starts to decrease to the point where you might end up with half of your nephrons and also as you age you lose your nephrons so we have a decreased ability to do all this magic and filter out things there is this one underlying most common cause of kidney disease as well as end stage renal failure and that relates to diabetes it nephropathy nephro meaning kidney apathy meaning disease so it glucose situation that is the most common reason why the kidney gets destroyed and the mechanism of how this filter gets destroyed is this when you have high levels of sugar interacting with these protein enzymes and other protein structures you start to get this reaction called glycation and that you have sugar and proteins okay it starts to damage these proteins to the point where they become unavailable and the medical term for this is called Advanced glycation end products so when you have a lot of those you have a combination of um nephrons or these little filters that don up with protein that is stuck in there and they can thing that they diagnose kidney disease with is the amount of protein in your urine because if we get less recycling of the protein it ends up in your urines not actually pulled into the body so protein in the urine means there kidney damage with that little filter and also because it urine there in your blood and that main symptom is edema okay and it could be all over your body is just filled with fluid so you be puffing the face fluid in your hands and your legs all over and the interesting thing about kidney disease is when the disease starts okay it takes 10 years sometimes before you even notice the first symptom okay and so now I that a person will experience with kidney disease it is nocturia now what is nocturia that is a situation where you urinating at night okay usually multiple times and it hold your urine throughout the night that is one of the first signs that means there your kidney and it makes a lot of sense because the majority of diabetics also have that same symptom and it also makes sense because diabetes usually takes 10 years before you start noticing problems so kidney problems go hand in hand with diabetes and one thing about diabetes is that it affects four tissues one is the kidney okay which we now next one is the eye next one is the nervous system okay and then the arteries and so with kidney problems you and you filtration rate we no longer have the filtering mechanism going on so we have a lot of backup with toxins we have a loss of a lot of nutrients including amino acids then we get a lot lot of Edema but because there of 10 years it the cause and effect relationship but I have found the most successful way to get rid of this nocturium is just to Simply handle the blood sugar situation so let in medicine they will tell you that diabetes is basically a situation where you have poorly controlled blood sugar levels so the key word with that is controlled or they use this other term called managed they manage the complications of diabetes they manage the symptoms of diabetes okay that kind of interesting you manage these complications and symptoms but what about correcting yeah you know they don really get into that why not manage or control what the patient is actually putting in their mouth and I about sugar the amount of sugar or carbohydrate that an average person consumes in America is astronomical if you especially if you take all the hidden carbohydrates like the breads the pasta the cereal crackers you massive amount of sugar right and it just so obvious why we have diabetics in the world because they many carbohydrates yet the American Diabetes Association uh still to this day does not tell you how much carbs you need to control they know there they know you need to reduce your carbs which is great but they don how much you should lower your carbs instead there managing your blood sugar and the complications what are the complications well fluid retention so we can manage that with a diuretic we also have high cholesterol we can manage that with statins we also have high blood pressure we can manage that with high blood pressure medication and of course the blood sugars could be managed by metformin and insulin and other medications for diabetes but my question is this when you manage the blood sugars remove the sugar out of the blood where does it go is it just magically evaporate does it just disappear it one place in the body to another place it cells into your liver around the organs converted into fat I mean what about the complications of all the medications that you complications from diabetes I mean just it kidney problems or you want to prevent kidney problems or you night right now urinating um there turn this thing around the first thing and the most obvious thing is to reduce the amount of sugar in your bloodstream okay that would mean going on a ketogenic eating plan okay second thing is doing intermittent fasting because the less you eat the less you will raise insulin the less insulin resistance you have so those go hand in hand and the type of intermittent fasting that I would recommend is the type that I doing right now which is one and a half meals a day now what does that mean you have your your big meal a little bit afternoon or maybe right at noon okay so you have your protein your fat um and then later I like to do it at three o maybe you can do it later at six o you can you can call it your second meal or your half a meal but you really doing a lot of protein you doing a lot of fat you vegetable carbohydrates okay and so what I do right around three maybe three Thirty at the very latest I big salad with roughly about seven to ten cups it maybe you could do seven cups and it big salad it to eat anything else so I have my protein and fat at 12. and that three of my big salad that way it the salad because I could take my time I do put various things in the salad I definitely put olive oil sometimes I use apple cider vinegar sometimes I use balsamic vinaigrette I seeds on that little nuts but it mainly greens and I might do different types of greens I like to use arugula or cabbage sometimes but if I cabbage I right so when you vegetables you can do a lot less when I talk about seven to ten cups I about the lettuce leaves okay so that seems to work really good I like it because it gives me a very long fasting period okay and am I hungry for that salad no because I just ate you know a few hours before but roughly it gives me like 21 hours of fasting now a couple of very important things about that salad that I want to mention in relationship to what we you know people always talk about oh yeah there salad um well there important in relationship to the complications of kidney disease and the complications of diabetes and that is phytonutrients okay phytonutrients have all sorts of pretty cool properties but the big one is nephro protection they protect the kidney against oxidation and complications of high blood sugar so if you took two diabetics right and you side to side and you gave one a diet with low phytonutrients and you gave the other one a diet high in phytonutrients both of them would still be a diabetic but the one with the phytonutrients would have a lot less complications okay so apparently these phytonutrients are there they have antioxidant properties they help reduce the oxidation they act to neutralize a lot of the bad effects of all this high glucose flowing through your bloodstream so that should be consuming this large salad every single day yes it has magnesium and vitamin C and potassium which by the way is very important for the kidney to protect it of course the only time I would recommend not doing it is if you have end-stage kidney disease then you have to get with your doctor but I talking about potassium from the food so plant phytonutrients are definitely on the list the next thing I want to mention and this is a remedy that you can get and it lot of research behind it it benphotamine it that is fat soluble and it really helps reduce the common applications in a powerful way of diabetes like I said reduce the glycation effect decrease oxidative stress and protect the cells this is why benphotamine is really good for peripheral neuropathy as well that the damage of the nerves in the bottom of the feet as well as problems with your eye called diabetic retinopathy but it complications from diabetic nephropathy okay damage to the kidney you basically take one pill which I think is uh usually like 300 milligrams four times a day another thing that you could add if you really wanted to it necessary if you other things I lipoic acid is another powerful way to decrease the complications from this condition another thing you can use is a turmeric okay turmeric has this phytonutrient called curcumin which is extremely potent and decreasing the symptoms the signs the complications of diabetes we want to reduce the amount of carbohydrates and we want to actually correct the underlying problem and that intermittent fasting are a necessity but at the same time we can do some great things by reducing all these other side effects that are occurring because of the high blood sugar as an experiment okay if you carbohydrates maybe you just want to prove it to yourself and see how these other things can work by adding some of these remedies to see how it can actually reduce maybe even the need for medication or the amount of medication you doctor but it can definitely help you so anyway I just wanted to cover this topic and give you some information that you need to use if you have this problem and I think if you are urinating at night frequently this is exactly what I would recommend now you might say well there no way that I don well you should actually get a test called Homa IR which measures the insulin resistance which happens way before diabetes but the point is there is a connection between the carbohydrates that you eat and nocturia getting up in the middle of the night and urinating now to have the right plan in place to know what to eat and how to do intermittent fasting I have my very simple playlist up here you should check this out right here	Success
Stop Constant Throat Clearing: Understanding the 3 Causes of Phlegm in Your Throat	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RslGnogsyCA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we me okay just one second okay good we going to talk about mucus in the back of your throat I to do that so I six months ago but I didn the underlying causes to this problem and then understand a little bit more about it and then also have remedies that don problems unfortunately when you treat mucus problems medically uh comes with a package it comes with side effects especially if you use antibiotics when you really have a viral infection because it except you know make your immune system very very weak um a good portion of our immune system actually has to do with our friendly microbes that are living all around us outside and inside and as soon as you start killing those guys off you have a weakened immune system and then you get this overgrowth of other problems so when we mucus in the upper respiratory tract um you have to realize that any time you kill off bacteria you then get an overgrowth of fungus or candida or Yeast because the bacteria keep in check all the different fungal type microorganisms and this is why people develop candida and throughout their body and their mouth and the private parts and also that relates to the sinuses after an antibiotic here you are dealing with the bacterial infection now you infection right and then you take stronger medications and then you get this resistance to this treatment and now you have even a stronger microbe so it puts you in a really bad place so an ideal solution is a solution that doesn bigger problem after you to solve it all right so let Right In and talk about all the potential causes starting with the one that I talked about in the other video uh gerd okay gerd is a situation where you have um some really severe acid reflux because the valve on the top of the stomach is not closing so acid kind of goes up into the esophagus it can go all up into the throat and it can irritate the structures of the throat and create this inflammation and mucus and a lot of people have that problem and don really connect the dots okay and of course if they do connect the dots they that shuts down the acid which usually just keeps the problem there longer because the actual underlying cause to gerd usually is a deficiency of acid you don not strong enough so anything treatment wise to weaken that or make this worse or alkalize your stomach tends to cause you to go from bad to worse if you have this problem I do want you to watch a complete video on acid reflux and gerd so I will put that down below but the whole point is this if you attack the right problem you get rid of the problem and the symptoms so one quick way to know if your gerd or acid reflux whatever is causing this mucus is simply not to necessarily spend a lot of money on a scope you could do that to kind of go down and scope and see what and do a very expensive valuation but what about just taking a very inexpensive remedy like apple cider vinegar two tablespoons in some water and you just start drinking that a few times a day before the meals and see if your symptoms go away and then you pretty much know that was it you can also take something called betame hydrochloride which is another good remedy it build up the hydrochloric acid in your stomach and you would just take like five before a meal and you might want to go up each day to like one more one more because some people need like a good amount they might need like seven eight nine ten before a meal before they see changes but then they much better another indication to know that if you might have this gerd connection to your mucus is that you also have gas indigestion bloating when you eat next potential cause is this post nasal drip situation and that coming from on the back of the sinuses and it causing you to cough up mucus this could be coming from a bacterial infection a viral infection a fungal infection which also includes yeast and candida it can also be coming from biofilms if you haven biofilm is a collection a colony of microbes that band together to help them survive and usually they produce this mucoid or mucous layer this slime okay which happens to be common in the sinuses and then sometimes even a calcium shell as in like you would get tartar in your teeth or even plaquing in the arteries but the sinuses you just might have this mucous layer and it biofilm that keeps things resistance against antibiotics and other forms of medical treatment yeah it keeps this constant irritation in your sinuses where your sinus is always stuffy you can because you uh mucus in the back of the throat and a lot of times if you have more of a fungal or Yeast or Candida or biofilms it have this problem and usually it gets triggered by taking an antibiotic so if you months ago or a few years ago and you notice wow my sinuses are worse after that suspect more of a this overgrowth of either fungus or biofilms now normally we have biofilms in the sinuses in the mouth in our bodies but we shouldn situation where it biofilms and that about but think about this these microbes are just trying to survive right they need to protect themselves so anytime you try to kill them with the wrong thing they will resist that and become stronger and especially after antibiotics if this infection is post nasal drip infection is more bacterial the mucus will tend to be more yellow or green if it clear or white but that cross over you can also have an infection where you have both microorganisms living together so there do for this post nasal drip depending on if it it basic salt water or saline solution I recommend using a sea salt solution and you you get a Neti Pot which is like this little nasal rinse and you can put it up one nostril and let it drain out the other one you there demonstrating how to do it really easy but it can flush out the sinuses apparently salt is antimicrobial especially for bacteria and fungus and yeast and candida and potentially it could help viruses too to some degree as well as help reduce how the biofilms stick to the inside layer of your membrane however if it major problem you something stronger you half a teaspoon equals 2.5 milliliters of sea salt into some container you have a cup of water which is eight ounces or 236 milliliters for those of you in Europe and my friend Dennis and so you dissolve the salt in the water and you use it as a nasal rinse and you just flush it out that may be enough to handle this problem okay but let stronger okay this next combination is very effective and a lot of doctors recommend it and use it you be using a small amount of baby shampoo yeah baby shampoo the reason why you shampoo it and it membranes so you want to use something that is like a no tier very gentle and something that has the least amount of chemicals I give you any Brands you to do the research but all you do is you take two teaspoons of this baby shampoo and put it into four cups of water and then you would use that as a nasal rinse four times a day and it mucus dissolve because it it works great on that and because you irritate the inside mucous membranes if you also wanted to add some of that salt water you can just do that too and now you have this pretty effective remedy there mucus is being generated in the throat or maybe lower in the sinuses back up um behind the sinuses way back there or or even in the larynx or just the back of the throat that could happen too or you can have an infection in your tonsils so let it recommend povidone eye dag right you can get at the drugstore okay and you dilute it you want to get that one that says 10 on the bottle that absorption okay and you want to dilute it by 50 with water so you just take basically a half of an ounce of this povidone iodine and you mix another half ounce of water okay so what you do is you take a Q-tip dip it into this solution and rub it around the inside of each nostril iodine is a very potent antimicrobial and it diluted enough where it irritate your mucous membranes but now we add the iodine that cake and that actually will directly kill off things in your sinuses then what you do is you gargle with the rest to get this material in the back of the throats then you gargle it for like 30 seconds and then you spit it out okay and you do that twice a day with a 12 hour time frame between when you gargle it so now we expose the back of the throat to this public down iodine which is a very powerful antimicrobial so that way we can topically put something to start to break up this mucus now of course if this problem is an allergy environmentally the best thing to do is to avoid certain parts of your environment and do fasting prolonged fasting improves the immune system and also it actually can help even get rid of allergies so that then as far as food allergies the most common food allergy involves Dairy so I would just simply cut out Dairy and you mucus will go away now one more point about the mucus and where it so if it throat or it coming up that thing to figure out um that is to really isolate and dig down where the problem is coming from okay now I going to give you another thing to do that I didn work good and I relating to sore throats but you can apply this to this problem too so if the problem is stemming from the back of your throat okay what you can do is a kind of a pressure point acupressure Point thing where you your neck now you can back of your neck you have to have someone do it to you but I did a video on it and you basically have someone take their two fingers right here and press in the vertebra in the back part and then what you do is you kind of isolate where that irritation is or where that mucus is coming from it could be like right here it could be lower it could be somewhere through here and then what you do is you draw a circle around to the back part of your neck now if you think this is weird I understand but it really works you have to try it okay once you isolated the exact opposite point in the back of your neck you have someone press into that point and the way that you know that you found the right points because sometimes it very very sore so have the person kind of go up a little bit higher in the neck or a little bit lower until they find the exact point where it and then you have them apply that pressure for a period of two minutes now the fingers we might get tired you don have to press that hard but you to start feeling things breaking up where things kind of draining or things feeling less congested or irritated I don works and I in fact I would have people fly in from different places around the country for this problem and I would work on through the day within a few days it would greatly help them if not completely get rid of it so this is just another thing to do which is a very ninja technique and so if you have someone around you that can do this on you that have built a device do-it-yourself device you can get that too I some videos on how to apply that but it in the back of your neck and you can lay back and let gravity put pressure in the back of your neck but you can apply pressure different points in your spine to just to help whatever this side right here there of place where you in your throat whether it is a sore throat or just a point of where you generating mucus because some people generate a mucus from their larynx okay and that hoarse so they have all this mucus generated from that this is a great technique when I did a video on this I had so many success stories of people doing this so you can read them check it out try it if it works great I mean what do you have to lose you don anything to lower your immune system you want to enhance the immune system the immune system is ultimately the thing that else not a remedy so all you assisting the immune system so garlic is at the top of the list consuming Morgana garlic through the day garlic in your food very potent anti-everything I antiviral bacterial yeast fungus mold biofilm garlic it should be at the top of the list number two no sugar sugar feeds these microbes especially if you have fungus yeast or candida okay avoid all sugar and then there remedies that I always recommend for the immune system a lot of vitamin D minimally 20 20 to 30 000 I use every single day vitamin C make sure you do a natural version not the synthetic version and then zinc those three are the go-to for every single immune problem I would recommend that and then lastly I would recommend if you have coughing let child that of this mucus sometimes you can take calcium lactate and that will just suppress the cough it for coughing that could be mucus related or not but coughing through the night especially for kids or adults take the calcium if you look up one of the symptoms of low calcium okay hypocalcemia that would be laryngeal spasm so you get muscle spasms especially in this this area right through in the throat and that can irritate and create a coughing sensation all right I gave you a lot to swallow on this one no pun intended but the next video you should watch is the other video on uh how to get rid of phlegm and mucus and I put that video up right here check it

The FIRST Sign of a Vitamin A Deficiency Is...	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMW8E5aLNsE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	what do you think the first sign of a vitamin A deficiency would manifest as in your body now if you guessed Nick delopia you are correct now what is this Nick telopia I mean it sometimes when people give you these words that you might not understand um then you tell them like what does that mean they might slow it down like nicktolopia I me I need to know what the heck it means so you have to get a dictionary out and look up the word but nicktolopia basically is night blindness okay you can whether you um in the dark and you time seeing the road or it and it the road or even if you your office reading a book and there may think you need glasses when in fact you might need Vitamin A now I will say that if you spend any amount of time reading your phone looking at your computer screen like I do many many hours a day what the muscles on the eye go into a spasm okay and they stay in this little spasm which then will affect your ability to see then you go to the eye doctor and you something like this which is interesting because I when I went there I asked the ophthalmologist I said um why do we need glasses um is it a genetic problem and he goes yeah it doesn asked him I said looking at a computer screen or reading a book for long periods of time doesn vision he says well I can with you yeah that probably does but honestly these eye doctors probably are not taught a lot of preventative type things to prevent um you from developing this spasm in your eye what I would highly recommend and I put this in a video is to get outside every single day to try to counter this spasm going on in the eye by looking in the distance looking at trees looking at things and focusing in on purpose various things in your environment for at least an hour a day that would be very therapeutic and the chances of you needing glasses would be greatly lessened in fact if you have glasses you time if you did that but if you have difficulty seeing in dim lighting or at night while you vitamin A deficiency now there interesting things about vitamin A okay the active form of vitamin A is called retinol okay so why did they come up this name Retinol for vitamin A could it be that it has something to do with the retina which is the back part of the eye it allows you to see so vitamin A retinol the active form not beta-carotene which is the precursor that has to convert into retinol retinol is needed to help you create this little protein in your eye that converts light two electrical signals and that visual purple or rhodopsin so vitamin A is needed to form this pigment for these little things in your eyes that are called rods okay and these little rods help you see in the peripheral area of your vision as well as low illuminated areas right now I want to touch on this precursor beta-carotene um that converts into retinol it amazes me that they actually I think they change the definition I don long ago that beta-carotene the precursor is vitamin A well it active form of vitamin A it precursor and it has to be converted into retinol let um the amount of retinol that ounces of beef liver because beef liver is very very high in retinol okay three ounces how much beta-carotene in carrots would you need to have the same retinol okay as in three ounces of beef liver you would need 40 pounds of raw carrots that would be very difficult to consume I mean I can see like 20 pounds but 40 pounds of carrots it happen all right how much kale would you need to equal the amount of retinol and just three ounces of beef liver well you need 454 cups of raw kale to equal the retinol and only three ounces of beef liver incredible it to happen so if you three or four or five cups of kale in your salad whatever and you think you getting enough true vitamin A chances are you high in vitamin A of course grass-fed beef liver okay egg yolks cod liver oil now fish oil has the omega-3 fatty acids but not the vitamin A like cod liver cod liver oil has omega-3 fatty acids as well as vitamin d and vitamin A raw cheese has a good amount of vitamin A raw cream and raw butter has a good amount of retinol but pasteurization destroys vitamin A so if you pasteurized milk or pasteurized cheese which is the majority of cheese or pasteurized butter or even if you eating a lot of overly cooked carrots or cooked vegetables that has the precursor you A now if you raw milk cheese if you can get sheep cheese you in fact there you can get to get a good amount of vitamin A and that is actually rat milk so if you run out of sheep cheese milk you always have a plan B so vitamin A is needed to prevent night blindness okay to be able to see in the dark somewhat it it compensate so this is probably why if someone they focusing in on different things because another symptom of vitamin A deficiency is dry eyes but also dry skin vitamin A is also necessary for any type of skin differentiation so if you don enough vitamin A your skin might not turn into a nice soft skin it might be rough scaly dry skin it the eye compensate for distances as well so some of the accommodation reflex is dependent on a certain amount of vitamin A vitamin A is desperately needed to prevent infections because it important for your immune system and I not just talking about the external scan I internal skin like the mucous membranes of your sinuses like the internal skin of the esophagus of the stomach of the intestines can all be affected by a vitamin A deficiency and as a child is developing early on that child needs a good amount of vitamin A so this relates to why certain people are deficient right a woman who more susceptible to having a vitamin A deficiency because of the demand for vitamin A it goes up also if she breastfeeding she needs more vitamin A this is probably why uh your grandmother or your parents recommended a spoonful of cod liver oil on a regular basis that delicious cod liver oil so other reasons why people are deficient is having this false idea that beta-carotene is retinol it converted into retinol to be active and that leads to another reason why a person might be deficient in vitamin A well there polymorphism that is the genetic mutation that can affect certain things in your body but apparently the gene that converts beta-carotene into retinol could be a polymorphic Gene it could be mutated in fact there that shows that it to have a problem with that Gene that converts beta-carotene into retinol so that could be another reason why someone is deficient in retinol because they might be consuming a lot of beta-carotene it they might be consuming in the active form of vitamin A yet they have this genetic weakness and by the way if that would recommend not just increasing the amount of retinol Foods okay I would also add bile salts and maybe another type of bile salt called tatka to increase more absorption and of course that why people are deficient vitamin A they don problems let or they had gallstones or they have their gallbladder removed or they have a sludge in the gallbladder or they have a fatty liver or some other problem with the liver that makes bile there of reasons why you might not have enough bile it also could be you took an antibiotic the microbes in your gut actually make a certain type of bile as well so that could be another reason let low-fat diet of course if you you high in retinol let medication called Statin that blocks your ability to turn cholesterol into bile you end up with the bile deficiency so taking statins can actually give you a vitamin A deficiency as well and the last point on why you might be deficient is just some knowledge on vitamin A gets destroyed with heat so if milk is pasteurized if someone consumes milk and it not going to get a vitamin A or let say they or kale that that just destroys the precursor so it not going to turn into retinol or again you just doing the regular pasteurized cheese another problem all right so now you definitely know more about vitamin A okay I think the next best video for you to watch would be the one on cod liver oil so check that out I put it up right here	Success
How to Rid Your Xanthomas (Naturally)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH8XTQAbIRs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	So today we to get rid of xanthomas what is a xanthoma a xanthoma is a buildup of cholesterol and triglycerides on the top of the skin it called macrophages which is an immune cell that eats up things and it sucking up too much cholesterol and triglyceride and it it shows up as this yellowish white deposit sometimes on the inside of the eyelid right through here on both sides or in the palm of the hand or your elbows your knees your Achilles tendon and that but what is at the bottom of this what is really causing this and then how do we get rid of it but first let about what we know about xanthomas we do know that many times these xanthomas are associated okay they don but they hereditary lipid disorder okay lipids are fats so one example would be a familial hyper cholesterol anemia and that passed on by your genes where you have high cholesterol which is very resistant to various types of treatment it really a problem where you don enough receptors in your liver for LDL cholesterol and so your body just can get rid of this cholesterol so sometimes it these xanthemas but it with various other things that I want to talk about too one being delivery track obstruction what is that that is a blockage of your bile ducts because bile is the primary thing that gets rid of excess cholesterol you just have excess cholesterol because the bile can its job then you have another condition called primary biliary cirrhosis and this is another condition where we getting a blockage of the bile things are not flowing correctly through the bile ducts so we problem with getting rid of cholesterol then we have another condition called choleostasis now the term stasis means stagnant it cholesterol is not moving through the body there and this is actually I find it common in a lot of people they have this bile sludge that is not along the flow of bile and they have all sorts of issues with right shoulder pain because of the backup of the system with inability to digest fats with um discomfort underneath the right rib cage with an increased risk of getting gallstones which is a bile salt deficiency and choleostasis which is his bio sludge is really kind of like the step that occurs before you get a stone because bile helps thin this sludge and xanthalmas are also associated with high A1C and diabetes which means there much glucose in your blood and so when someone has this xanthoma okay it little red indicator light letting you know that you have high cholesterol probably high triglycerides and probably high LDL caused by the things I just mentioned a lot of times people have this idea that if they have high cholesterol or triglycerides in their blood that means they cholesterol fat or triglycerides when in fact this is not always the case carbs sugar refined carbohydrates convert very easily to triglycerides and color strong and so your high LDL cholesterol and triglycerides could be coming just because you not necessarily fat and on the flip side of that many times people think that the ketogenic diet is really a high fat diet when actually the ketogenic diet really means low carb it doesn necessarily high fat but of course when you lower your carbs and you have moderate protein you end up eating a lot of fat but to generate ketones you do it by lowering your carbs all right so what can someone do about these xanthomas okay I things the most important thing is to take niacin in the amount of niacin I would recommend would be 500 milligrams extended release and I would take that two to three times a day by the way niacin is one of the most potent ways to lower cholesterol in the body especially the buildup of cholesterol in different parts of the body as well as reducing the uptake of LDL by the macrophage okay number two I would recommend choline okay choline is a supplement choline helps to prevent a fatty liver choline helps to reduce cholesterol number three tadka what is tuck cup it specialized type of bile salt that helps cholestasis which is that stagnant cholesterol in your bile ducts it helps the flow of cholesterol it helps reduce cholesterol it helps The receptors in the liver take on LDL it helps to lower LDL cholesterol it does a lot but what we want is a nice flow of cholesterol out of the liver so you can get rid of the excess cholesterol so niacin choline Tucka okay I also recommend consuming huge salads okay like seven to ten cups of salad every single day and I would also put walnuts on the salad because they omega-3 fatty acids okay which actually helps lower cholesterol and I would also put extra virgin olive oil with some garlic on there and that assist in getting rid of some of this cholesterol now the next recommendation is to exercise every day especially if you have high triglycerides those extra triglycerides in your bloodstream can be burned off with using more energy so we need to add exercise into this protocol all right the next recommendation is to try to get a good portion of your protein from fish or seafood high in omega-3 fatty acids that will also help there called red yeast rice extract is like a natural version of a Statin it is very powerful in lowering your cholesterol you may not need it but if you have a very very stubborn situation where you can would be something I would investigate and look at implementing as well number eight doing the healthy ketogenic diet with a Twist so you just did a ketogenic diet without adding a lot of fat okay consume fat in this ketogenic plan that normally comes with the protein just don don or all these other extra fats and maybe the fats that you do focus on would be the avocado oil the olive oil the omega-3 oils in either cod liver oil or fish oil or sardines but this way we can lower the carbs so we don extra conversion of cholesterol being created especially if you are a diabetic or you have a high A1C and the last thing is doing intermittent fasting that can greatly assist in regulating your cholesterol profiles now since I mentioned niacin as the number one thing to do if you haven niacin it check it out I put it up right here	Success
Take This IMMEDIATELY after a Stroke	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBDYdTaMUTg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you know having the right information for various health conditions especially a stroke um could be the difference between you having a full recovery and not having any recovery so today I you some really important information on what to do if you have a stroke as far as what nutrient to take as well as the best nutrient to recover from a stroke if you get one now you have many strokes and then you have severe Strokes the mini strokes can last anywhere between 15 minutes to 24 hours and the symptoms are not permanent they go away but then you have a severe stroke which can leave permanent damage on one side of your body and if you get a mini stroke the odds of you getting a severe stroke are pretty high it the next year so it clue that you better change things really quick and this video is going to be very important if you mini stroke now there way to identify various indicators that you is be fast and b stands for balance let coordinated so that that gets blurry all right F is for face so one side of your face starts drooping and you can identify this if you smile then you have a for on so one of your arms just does not want to go up and then s for speech your speech is a little bit slurred and then T basically for time because you want to call an ambulance really fast there drug that they give you if you catch it under four hours to help dissolve the clot so what is this nutrient that important well it but it you might have heard of like tocopherol it called tocatrino and each type of vitamin E has their own subtype so you have like Alpha the beta the gamma the Delta for each type of vitamin E and the alpha tocotrino is a thousand times stronger than the alpha tocopherol in protecting the neural degeneration that occurs from a stroke and all it takes is extremely small doses to prevent a glutamate induced brain cell death so let you have a problem with your speech or your arm or you you immediately to prevent more damage but even if you don hand I would go out to get some and use that in your rehab for a stroke and whatever it recommends on the directions I would take probably four times that and I would spread it out through the day and I would not take it with tocopherolsk I would only take tocatrinols in a blend that includes the alpha the beta the gamma and the Delta because apparently the decofalo all and the tokatrinos tend to compete and we don so tocotrinos can be used to prevent a stroke to help during the stroke preventing damage and in the recovery phase after you get a stroke the tocatrinals have very special properties protecting the cell membrane of a neuron so it Alzheimer Parkinson involuntary movement or twisting motion it which is this condition where you are very uncoordinated your balance is is terrible and you don some type of damage in the back part of the brain called the cerebellum and it also good for another condition called dis autonomia okay so basically that dysfunction of your autonomic nervous system the sympathetic and the parasympathetic if there two systems that are working in overdrive or not working strong enough vitamin E is what you should take so one example would be let just can exercise you do another opposite condition would be you just sweat all the time and you you can that would be an example of dysautonomia another condition would be called pots okay that even stand up without you know passing out it autonomic nervous system and I about that in a lot of videos B1 is very very important but also vitamin E in the form of tocotrenals and one last thing that tocotrinos are really good for has nothing to do with the brain it has everything to do with the heart okay as in like a heart attack so you can look at tocotrinals as a natural version of nitroglycerin because it in increasing the oxygen to the heart muscle itself now vitamin E in general is necessary to allow the omega-3 fats especially DHA to work in the brain so if you could be taking a lot of fish oils and DHA directly and not notice a lot of change one of the biggest reasons why people are deficient in vitamin E is they consume too many refined grains so refined grains are a big reason why you might be deficient in vitamin E or it could be you enough foods that are high in vitamin E now we talk about tocotranos it difficult to get it from Foods because I Neto which you of then we have palm oil well a lot of people don in rice bran oil okay which a lot of people don in olive oil in very small amounts out of all the conditions that you can get you don how do you prevent it do you just take an aspirin a day well you should check with your doctor with that but there some recent information about aspirin that could be damaging especially if you have a hemorrhage type stroke where there you take an aspirin and it causes more bleeding in your stomach and other parts of the body I take your aspirin but just check with your doctor and then get the full information on if you should take it or not but there thin the blood like garlic that being on the ketogenic diet and getting the sugars out of the diet which is one of the deeper causes for a clot or a plaquing or the formation of a plaque omega-3 fatty acids okay fish oils very important cod liver oil is really good as well as well as getting rid of the omega-6 fatty acids which is in a lot of restaurant foods and it soil oil and the corn oil and the canola oil in the safflower oil the sunflower oil so they can create inflammation in the arteries and potentially cause a problem with the stroke down the road and regular exercise to keep the blood flow and to actually decrease your risk of stroke but if you ever experience any symptoms of a stroke where you know someone that had a stroke get them on the tocatranal version of vitamin E now if you haven top katrinos I right here check it out	Success
11 Ways to Protect Your Liver from Toxins	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so there that takes a beating it does the majority of detoxification and that cell is called the hepatocyte and hepatocytes are liver cells so your liver is the main detoxification organ of the entire body to a lesser degree the kidneys help you detoxify in small intestine helps you detoxify the skin can help you detoxify and even your fat cells can help to some degree detoxify but it a beating So today we about how to make sure your liver is doing its job I want to give you some solutions that are simple easy changes to protect yourself but you do need to be aware of the quantity of chemicals that we are swimming in every day because they do affect us in a negative way but it versus another because there are so many chemicals and variables it to test for this I mean think about this we have 27 trillion pounds of chemicals that are produced or imported from other places to the U.S every single year that day which comes out to about 250 pounds of chemicals per person so there chemicals now you might say well I live a pretty clean life and I don really exposed to chemicals it doesn include fuels doesn it doesn your food and I poisons I meant medications from health care I mean it think about health care well that another way we chemicals to suppress symptoms I mean really what the health part I mean what is in health care that Health these chemicals they build up the half-life and some of these chemicals can be from weeks to years to decades and a half-life the substance is that you by 50 over a period of time so it becomes less activated and a lot of times they certain chemicals okay the book on toxicology you can see there quite a few toxins in our environment and a lot of information on it but the half-life a lot of these chemicals are measured usually through the blood not necessarily through your tissues the cells outside the blood which is a whole different thing we definitely need to do three things we need to be aware of the chemicals we need to reduce the exposure to the chemicals and we definitely need to increase the ability to detoxify the chemicals and the main support needs to be to the hepatocyte that liver cell and now a lot of these chemicals in the environment act like estrogen okay so they even endocrine disruptors because what they do to the endocrine systems they can act and mimic like your hormones and so they can really throw off the thyroid the adrenals the pituitary all these different hormonal Pathways and there definitely a direct connection between what those chemicals do and how they damage the DNA how they alter the DNA they can mutate and change the DNA and they create a lot of diseases a lot of oxidation and free radical damage and of course this free radical damage can create a whole Cascade of problems and this is why antioxidants help to counter that our bodies make antioxidants and we also can get antioxidants from food now another really interesting thing about certain chemicals in foods that can help us detoxify is the fact that we already have the Machinery the enzymes within our bodies okay we have certain enzymes that can turn poisons in Thomas particles but they can become activated by certain things in our Foods so sometimes we have this idea that it just the antioxidants that are kind of countering the oxidation but also they already have inside we just need to turn on those genes to do the job a little bit better and I just had my DNA tested and apparently I also have certain detoxifying genes that are not working like they should so I have to work harder at getting them to work so there called the cytochrome p450 enzymes and there that goes from phase one phase two phase three that helps to turn these poisons into things that are harmless so the majority of that occurs in that hepatocyte that it does incur in other places in the body so I going through uh things that we can do to minimize exposure to the poisons well you can do to activate them and also the number one food that will help you activate these enzymes that you already have all we have to do is trigger them we have toxins and pollution from the air from the water from the food from beauty products right lotions shampoo hair gels conditioners hair dyes etc etc etc we need to make sure those are as clean as possible let just talk about it so air pollution I would highly recommend getting some type of filter there Merv 8 and that can be very essential if you live in polluted areas especially if you live in the city you want that air filter to minimize the amount of chemicals and that can make a big difference in your exposure number two growing certain plants that can help soak up chemicals like Benzene and formaldehyde and many of the other chemicals in the air so it expensive thing to just have more plants in your house and I video down below of what plants I would recommend spending more time in nature is very very therapeutic from just breathing in healthy air all right what about a water filter do you have a shower filter do you have a water filter you definitely need to get one the amount of crap that mean even chlorine yes chlorine will kill off pathogens but on the flip side it can increase the risk of cancer so we have chlorine we have fluoride we have all these other chemicals in the water so you need to get a water filter and they don really simple uh relatively inexpensive water filter and you get all different kinds you can get it from the shower or a pitcher or under the counter or over the counter just go to zero water I put a link down below I with them but they have a good system they have three ways of getting rid of chemicals the carbon filter they have one that binds to heavy metals and they have another filter that will help reduce other things like chloride and fluoride and things like that now another really important thing is fish okay always it fish are loaded with pcbs okay just more chemicals you want to do wild caught and you definitely want to consume the fish that are smaller you don consume the big fish like avoid swordfish shark tuna these fish accumulate a lot of mercury because they tend to eat smaller fish that eat smaller fish so there much higher concentration of mercury like sometimes up to a thousand times more and that mercury can accumulate in your body but with the smallest fish there selenium can bind to the Mercury that in there and inactivate it so it problem now what about organic vegetables absolutely let can a considerable amount of organophosphates by using apple cider vinegar and water you just put a fourth of a cup of apple cider vinegar and a gallon of water and wash your vegetables you can remove a lot of chemicals just by that simple procedure so organic food is without pesticides and it is more nutrient dense now I already mentioned the chemical free beauty products so many people are exposing their bodies deodorants and hand creams and they not really reading the lab able these things accumulate they go into the liver the next thing I would really avoid is canned Foods canned foods greatly increase things called bpas and I going to get into the technicalities of them but if you go through this book right here and look at the section of bpas you create a lot of problems with your endocrine system their endocrine disruptors and you of them if you canned foods especially those soups so I would just avoid canned foods or if you do consume them don all right so let one food to help strengthen and trigger the detoxifying enzymes and the hepatocyte the liver cell and that is cruciferous vegetables now there will do it too like garlic for example onion will do it oregano but the cruciferous family of vegetables are potent inducers of cytochrome p450 enzymes and there of research on this it those Foods consumed on a regular basis can help too not just pull chemicals out but they also provide a lot of other benefits anti-inflammatory anti-cancer now every time you deal with toxins or free radicals or antioxidants people always think about plants right because we all know that these antioxidants are not in you know meets well that actually true I recently was involved in a study sending my beef from my farm into a study okay it nutrient density study I just want to show you this one graph right here I don this green bar right here okay right there versus the Blue Bar versus the this other colored bar right here I think it Berg Farmers on average of the grass-fed beef and then we have the grain-fed beef now what this is evaluating is phytonutrients these are plant-based chemicals plant-based chemicals in beef now the healthier the beef the more you chemicals that can act as antioxidants and create a lot of other health benefits but you can see there are definitely more if you compare grain fed to grass-fed definitely more but the healthier the beef like I do grass-fed grass finished okay and I really take care of my cattle so you can see the amount of phytonutrients this would be a great substitute for vegetables if you have gut problems right because there definitely a increase in people doing carnivore because of their gut issues and people will say well you can all the nutrients from beef or other types of organ Meats well apparently you can but I really think it well this just proves it it quality of meat you know you going to go down to the local um Safeway grocery store and get deli meat and think you getting those phytonutrients you know you market or you grass-fed grass finished to really get the full health benefits of these products is the animal being fed grains okay or grass and weeds grown unhealthy soils so we have the cruciferous vegetables like the kale the broccoli the arugula the radish all those are very very key but you also have all the herbs too that can greatly help you and then we have things that contain B vitamins that can help you detoxify I did a whole video on that it a very interesting video which I a link down below and then we have minerals that help you detoxify like selenium like in Brazil nuts very important to help increase glutathione which is another enzyme to help break down poisons and your gut microbiome is so important in supporting detoxification if you don your gut microbes that your ability to get rid of poisons so start consuming foods with microbes like sauerkraut kimchi kefir very important the next thing I want to talk about is fasting when you fast especially periodic prolonged fasting you increase your own body okay you strengthen and turn on the genes that help you detoxify your liver starts increasing its capacity to get rid of poisons you go through what called autophagy which is the recycling of old damaged proteins and getting rid of pathogens strengthening the systems that help keep you clean you know I had this really bizarre thought I would love to go into a nursing home and just replace their food just to see what would happen to the health of these elderly people I think the need for medications would go way down and it would probably just be miraculous but unfortunately I just found something out that certain regulations about people in nursing homes and I think even hospitals that they have to eat every 14 hours and they have to have these certain foods which I very very healthy so I think it would be very difficult unfortunately to put them on some type of intermittent fasting program which is exactly what they need and actually have them eat food that came from the farm that would be just awesome but if you have the ability to do intermittent fasting do it it to help you and last point about toxins is exercise and sweating very important when you exercise you stimulate genes that help you detoxify but if you over train you the systems to get rid of toxins because think about when you exercise you generating a lot of free radical damage and oxidation from just the metabolism of pushing yourself so that requires a strong robust antioxidant system there are certain things like grapefruit okay and grapefruit juice and St John that inhibit that detoxification system in the pedocyte so this is why if someone and they the same time they these chemicals in their body and I not telling you not to consume them I just telling you that they do tend to slow down the elimination of poisons there vitamin deficiency that can greatly influence your ability to detoxify and I put that video up right here check it out	Success
The END of Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx2YpCEL0sU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	90% of blood pressure is called essential hypertension and they don even know what causes it after all of this research today I blood pressure and give you some natural solutions that uh may have a lot less side effects than medication of course check with your doctor before implementing any of these Solutions so you have about a 100,000 miles of blood vessels in your body well that is a lot of blood vessels and these blood vessels do go to many Loc ations in your body many organs in fact all of your organs receive blood from your vascular system and so the problems with blood pressure extend Way Beyond just the vascular system Way Beyond just your heart it can affect the brain it can affect your eye it can affect the kidney increasing your risk of getting heart attacks and it definitely increases your risk of getting a stroke by a factor of 3x and blood pressure problems are very common if you of getting hypertension to me that is just way way too high now hypertension can also be compensating for various things for example if you have hypoxia let you have a lung problem where you don have enough oxygen the body is going to automatically sense that and start increasing blood pressure to get more blood in the area to get more oxygen low oxygen situation in another place so when someone then takes medication to lower the blood pressure pressure what happens to the lungs right it already is not getting enough oxygen now it really not going to get enough oxygen so this is one reason why people don really feel good many times when they get on blood pressure medication especially in the brain because it creates other issues I mean I think a really important question would be to understand why you have high blood pressure in the first place and this is just not emphasized very well it like well you have this disease we don really know what it is take this medication for a while you know drink more water get more exercise etc etc from my viewpoint there reasons for blood pressure low potassium low magnesium and low vitamin D levels so if I had hypertension those would be three things that I would look at immediately but instead in the medical profession you told to restrict sodium that is the primary focus not to increase potassium to reduce sodium and if that doesn work then the next thing to do is to give you a water pill a diuretic primarily they use a common one called hydrochloro thide This is a diuretic it gets rid of fluid and the sodium in the fluid but it is also a silent depleter of potassium so now we end up with lower amounts of potassium and a potassium deficiency could be the reason why you have high blood pressure in the first place now we go from low potassium to extremely low potassium so therefore this going to be more need for medication and of course when we talk about potassium they may recommend potassium but unfortunately potassium only comes in 99 milligram pills or less and the requirement for potassium is quite high it you have these pills that are 99 milligrams okay how many times this 99 or let to 4700 okay okay you do the math you have to have a lot of pills but this diuretic also depletes magnesium the other common reason why people have high blood pressure another side effect of this diuretic is the increase of homosysteine now if that doesn channel blockers okay those are medications for high blood pressure as well just working from a different angle the problem is it has some slight minor complications if you take it chronically over five years it can have a tendency to shrink your brain it also tends to increase your risk of certain types of cancer and in one study as far as the effectiveness goes they compared it against other medications that lower blood pressure and it really only brought your blood pressure down by 0.1 that okay so to me that insignificant then you have other medication like the ACE inhibitors problem is with that one it does increase the risk of getting allergies or even being allergic to the medication significantly also it can create a chronic cough as a side effect now I not sure if you got the recent memo about aspirin they finally found out that it doesn good benefits the outcomes are not that great and this was in jamama Aspirin myio cardial infarction study research group they found out that an aspir today has no benefit now there was another study that rekindled uh recommending aspirin taking an aspirin a day but they didn bufferin okay which is a different type of medication and that had magnesium oxide okay magnesium actually helps lower blood pressure and they also had added some beta cartine so who knows what was causing what there else that you should know about it called Nitric oxide nitric oxide greatly supports the inner layer of the arteries okay it helps to lower blood pressure because it vasodilator some people even try to increase it to uh handle their erectile dysfunction because that problem you see we arteries but it can affect a lot of things you probably heard of even vascular dementia because of what it can do to the brain we have an enzyme that helps make nitric oxide okay and that enzyme can be inhibited or turned off to a certain degree by a genetic variation problem so if you have this problem you might not have the benefit of that enzyme to make nitric oxide thereby developing hypertension and you can get a test to evaluate if you have this problem um there it you can uh look at a DNA test or even uh get this other test it ADM and that asymmetrical dimethyl Arginine so getting that test will tell you very quickly if you nitric oxide now the solution that I would recommend that has very minimal side effects if any is just to go out and buy some L Arginine L Arginine will help you make more nitric oxide so you can just include that as your uh protocol for helping yourself with this high blood pressure situation another really good natural remedy for high blood pressure is garlic garlic can act as a natural ace inhibitor as well as increasing this nitric oxide another really good food to take if you have high blood pressure is celery celery has a a couple powerful phytonutrients that can help lower blood pressure and reduce adrenaline so it helps you sleep it helps your blood pressure you stocks of the celery maybe with your last meal of the day and you that you from that now to support the endothelial layer of your arteries tokros is one of the best remedies for that that of vitamin E so when you think about anything um damaging the inside of the artery think tokat trinal and tokros are really good for Angina heart problems but especially to help act as a powerful antioxidant for the in side layer of your arteries let so we have potassium magnesium where can you get that from salads okay larger amounts of salads on a regular basis you can also get these an electrolyte powder as well vitamin D3 you can get that from the sun it start taking vitamin D3 that might just handle your blood pressure but you need to take at least 20,000 IUS every single day start including garlic in the diet celery and don Arginine okay you can get in a powder and maybe take a half a scoop or even a whole scoop each day okay to help increase nitric oxide and those tokat trinal that might come in handy to support the inside layer of your arteries but realize that you also need to handle the foundational problem of your diet and for

The Hidden Cause of Anemia You've Never Heard About	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today I source of anemia both B12 and iron anemia that you probably have never heard before and this involves a microbe called H pylori and each pylori is a fascinating bacteria that the majority of the population have already in their stomach and when the timing in the environment is just right it can come out of remission and create all sorts of problems primarily with gastritis inflammation of the stomach ulcers as well as atrophy of your stomach so the stomach starts shrinking out of all the places to exist why would you want to live in an acid stomach right and also it actually eats iron right that now typically what causes this microbe to come out of remission and create problems is when the stomach pH oses the acidity okay so the more alkaline your stomach becomes the more that that microbe can survive and potentially come out of remission when the pH becomes more alkaline as well as in individuals that are susceptible like their immune system is weaker as a survival mechanism it also has a enzyme called urease which basically causes the breakdown of urea and then that turns into ammonia now this is a survival mechanism because ammonia is that it it has a pH of like 11. I mean think about this we have the stomach which has a pH between 1.5 to 3 which is like battery acid so you have a pH of 11 for ammonia it allows this microbe to exist and Thrive now there molecular mimicry okay what is that that is another survival mechanism where that microbe can mimic your own stomach cells and so it radar and for the most part your immune system is tricked by that but not a hundred percent a lot of times there an immune reaction okay and then what that immune reaction does is it starts attacking your own stomach cells as well as something called the intrinsic factor and both of those situations lead you to a very severe B12 deficiency and then when the stomach atrophies because of this microbe now you to get what which is a B12 condition in the first phase when you have gastritis you have a lot of inflammation and you have a lot more acid and that quickly decreases as there stomach and you start having atrophy and you lose the function of these little gastric cells and then the stomach becomes more alkaline so you start off being too acid and then it goes over here to alkaline okay and that survival mechanism and when your stomach is not alkaline now we lose the ability to absorb iron we can that can deficient so we have both an iron deficiency and the B12 deficiency not a good situation so here you are taking all this iron taking all this B12 and wondering why it this thing but there going on completely underneath it and of course once you pylori the treatment is at least two months of antibiotics okay usually multiple antibiotics and the real unfortunate problem with that is that a lot of people end up with antibiotic resistance to this H pylori microbe so now the antibiotics won because the microbes quickly counter that mechanism so here you are two months of therapy right you have all these side effects of the condition as well as all the side effects from the antibiotic in your gut and other places this is why the treatment for H pylori with antibiotics is uh it successful long term because they looking down the road of what happening they microbe is the problem and so they just need to wipe it out and then the problem solved when in fact it the iceberg there with the pH of your stomach the strength of your immune system which now you just weaken because of the antibiotics now we still have gastritis we might have ulcers we have atrophy of the stomach we also now can against microbes that are coming in from our food so now we have an increased tendency to get infections to the body viruses bacteria fungal You Name It We also can also can so you can see this problem goes from bad to worse what could we do about this I would recommend taking something that is more of a natural antibiotic that is not as potent you have to take it longer but there and one of the best things they researched on this is sulforaphane which is interesting because it plant it broccoli Sprouts sauerkraut it cruciferous vegetables so sulforaphane is a compound is a potent anti-microbial and the extra cool thing about this is this it can work against antibiotic resistant microorganisms and infections okay so if you have this antibiotic resist instant microbe well sulforaphane can actually still work on that whereas a antibiotic won taking a natural remedy not as potent but we that we do this without the side effects so that add another natural antibiotic called wormwood okay wormwood extract and you don small amount over a long period of time and I months now you can get yourself aerophane from a supplement or I would recommend better yet get it from microgreens or Sprouts broccoli Sprouts or broccoli micro greens right and have a little bit of that every day in your salad that next thing I solution is zinc there forms of zinc you can take but it important to just get zinc than to focus on what type of form of Zinc but zinc can be very effective against ulcers gastritis as well as healing the stomach and helping you build up your hydrochloric acid and so once the gastritis settled down and the ulcer is healed then we want to add betaine hydrochloride or apple cider vinegar to your stomach but not until the ulcer is gone and the inflammation is gone the other thing that you want to do that can greatly help put things back in the balance is to either take a really good probiotic or better yet start consuming a little sauerkraut or even some pickles there are certain microbes in sauerkraut and pickles that are very beneficial to help counter this H pylori because remember we have the good bacteria and the bad bacteria right so we want to increase the good from this probiotic or the sauerkraut and help counter the situation and plus sauerkraut also has sulforaphane and it the digestion if someone has gastritis or for that matter any digestive issues all right so now that you know this other source of anemia which is very valuable if you have anemia probably important to show you the other causes of anemia okay and I put that up right here check out the video	Success
Sodium Sensitivity is a Potassium Deficiency	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcKc5TXbUH0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I want to talk about the dangers of too much salt or too much sodium okay we have heart disease we have high blood pressure we have stroke edema increased mortality sounds pretty scary right well these things occur not for the reason you think I mean the question is is it really too much sodium is that what causing the problem in reality our body tends to hold sodium if there fact there sensitivity where the body is retaining sodium but the reason why you retain sodium and therefore water is because you have a potassium deficiency this is something that not talked about too much we focused on sodium we kind of forget about this other mineral called potassium but sodium potassium always work together in the body it like a teeter-totter the requirements for sodium per day are 2300 milligrams but the requirements for potassium are 4 700 that this ratio is really really important okay two to one twice as much potassium as sodium and guess what you will no longer be salt sensitive in fact the symptoms of this excess sodium will disappear when you increase your potassium you see the majority of the population has as this problem of too much sodium and not enough potassium okay they don they eat a lot of processed foods you get your sodium from junk Foods refined foods and restaurant Foods very few people ever consume enough potassium foods right they think if I have a banana a day that banana has about 300 milligrams now remember you need 4 700 okay you to have you know more than 12 bananas and then you sugar which is not going to happen so you have this situation where people are just really heavy on the sodium but very very low on the potassium and this is where we have the problem on top of that okay 38 of the population has a genetic uh variation with a certain Gene called the ace Gene which means that Gene is overactive which means they be more salt sensitive when they have more sodium and they more blood pressure because of that this simple solution is just to increase your potassium especially if you have this Gene problem and not do what everyone else is doing by reducing their sodium reducing their salt going on the low salt diet because now they have a situation where they and low in potassium and that worse because they around so tired you need both sodium potassium for something called the sodium potassium pump okay in fact all of your cells have this pump this is what activates the nerves this is what activates the muscles and when you deficient in these key electrolytes boy you get all sorts of issues with the heart like arrhythmias you get tired you feel weak and all you need to do is increase the sodium and potassium but in the right ratios and the real problem is a potassium deficiency low potassium causes the retention of sodium and this is where you have all the problems with the heart with the blood pressure with hardening of the arteries with increased risk of arrhythmias and stroke potassium is not retained like sodium is so when we have a lot of potassium it the kidneys unless you have like stage five kidney disease which is very rare however sodium is much more retained especially if you have low potassium so this is probably a common cause of leg cramps as well so we do need sodium okay we need sufficient amounts but we need a lot more potassium now to really learn about how to get more potassium through your foods this is the next video you should watch right here	Success
The ANTI-INFLAMMATORY That Will Surprise You	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDwcr8ogZJQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	we powerful anti-inflammatory that you anti-inflammatory before in fact you probably think of this thing I to talk about in a negative light like something you should avoid but it is a potent anti-inflammatory and the cost of it is pretty inexpensive in fact it free ultraviolet radiation but I even say the word UV radiation you probably immediately think wow skin cancer avoid this radiation it bad but you have to realize this UV radiation which is a part of the spectrum of energy from the Sun I mean human beings animals and plants have coexisted with these Rays for a very long time so we have developed all sorts of adaptation to survive this radiation and use it to our advantage in fact when we with the sun radiation is the only part of that sun energy that you can make vitamin D and you know how important vitamin D is it the most important uh vitamin for your immune system it the most potent anti-inflammatory but it now before you disagree and click off hear me out because we about the dosage Okay small amounts of UV radiation now I much of it chronic exposure to UV radiation is really bad it can increase your risk of melanoma it can produce a lot of wrinkles it can take the water right out of your skin and make your skin very dehydrated it dosage of this radiation but a small amount here and there not the amount that it would create a burn but maybe a very slight tan could be very very beneficial so let me first explain what makes up ultraviolet radiation you have UVA UVB and UVC let UBC and get that on the way because it doesn going to talk about because you really not exposed to UVC UVC is generated by the sun and it gets trapped in the ozone layer so it never ends up on Earth but they do make UVC artificially in different wands that they use to kill certain microbes and so it can definitely create some problems believe me but you don about it from the Sun so now that leaves us with UV a and UV beads what are the differences very simply majority of this ultraviolet radiation is in the form of UVA like 98.7 and it damaging energy but if you are exposed to much of it it you the wrinkles loss of collagen it can even give you the Aging spots which by the way if you have enough antioxidants in your skin that can protect you now let that that can give you a moderate amount of damage like a little bit more than the UVA but not if you smaller doses it vitamin D by interacting with cholesterol on your skin so right there we have two things that are like a negative right people think oh my gosh I need to protect myself against ultraviolet radiation and protect myself against cholesterol well if you combine those two things you get vitamin D which is very very important especially since the majority of the population is deficient in the vitamin D in fact there think I agree with it impossible even to develop an autoimmune disease if you have sufficient vitamin D simply because how Vitamin D is so intertwined with every part of your immune system now UVB radiation also is the one that triggers the melanocytes to make melanin okay melanin is the the pigment that makes your skin darker okay and so people that are more fair complected have less melanin versus people with darker skin and this pigment is interesting because it acts like a sunblock it protects you against the UV radiation the damaging rays that can affect your DNA so it sunscreen or a sunblock and so when you that cell that makes the pigment so now you become more protected against that radiation so that effect where you small amount of stress to then be stronger than you were before the UVA does penetrate deeper than the UVB it penetrates into the dermis whereas the UVB only penetrates superficially into the epidermis now again both of these Rays can produce DNA damage they can produce cancer they can produce a loss of collagen and wrinkles Etc but it all depends on the dose and your level of antioxidants in the skin but let benefits to ultraviolet radiation in general okay that type of energy can give you an anti-inflammatory effect now in large doses it can create inflammation but in smaller doses it can actually reduce the cytokines that produce this inflammation cytokines are involved in the inflammatory process the UV radiation can trigger a certain T Cell It which is involved in decreasing your risk for autoimmunity which is very very interesting because there are a higher risk of developing autoimmune diseases the higher you live away from the Sun like in higher latitudes like in the North if you live away from the Sun you autoimmune diseases you of getting cardiovascular problems you certain types of cancer which is pretty wild now this partly has to do probably with the creation of the vitamin D but there this vitamin d a fact but just realize that the further away you are from the sun latitudes the less ultraviolet radiation you also decreases the risk of getting TB and their Associated skin disease that comes with it in fact the sun was considered the antidote for TB way back when they had the sanitariums now there radiation that are not even associated with vitamin D in suppressing the symptoms of eczema psoriasis dermatitis Vitiligo which is the loss of pigment and even Scleroderma there different type of light remedies using UV radiation photobiomodulation therapy that they use in these skin disorders and they use a very narrow band UVB radiation to help in these conditions but again they they of time they to create these interesting effects there it an opioid effect of this UV for pain so the next time you in the sun and see if it doesn you the UV radiation also has an effect on the HPA axis that pituitary adrenal axis in that it can help regulate cortisol which is a positive thing when you have stress and you can important hormone but UV does affect your endocrine system in a positive way if you have these small doses UV radiation also increases nitric oxide I inside of your arteries but nitric oxide also can be very beneficial to your skin and act as a protective mechanism against the UV radiation UV also in short doses gives you reparative actions probably because of the Hermetic or stress effect and then the adaptation that comes after UV radiation can elevate your mood this is probably why people feel better in The Sun Also it can increase and help balance serotonin in the body so I just wanted to create this video to kind of show you the other side of ultraviolet radiation it has a lot of positives if you don it avoid the Sun and use a lot of sunblock and wear hats and glasses all the time a little bit can help you and of course out of all of these factors that are related to UV I think vitamin D is probably on the top of the list as far as the most important and I want to give you some more information on a vitamin D itself in relationship to the Sun so I put that video up right here check it out	Success
The #1 Vitamin Deficiency behind Bladder Issues (Freq. Urination, Leaky, Urgency)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElKTOnm2kEw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	this video is very applicable to anyone with a problem with their bladder whether it urinary urgency okay leaky bladder incomplete urination or frequent urination or you get up several times at night this video is for you and unfortunately when you do a Google search on this topic you of these sites that you go to say almost the exact same thing and what they do is they just hire search engine optimization people SEO people to write articles these people have no experience but they just get the keywords and they create articles and then they rank on Google so it find anything valuable on Google relating to health information especially the bladder and unless you know what to search for and some possible links it I have the advantage of just have been in practice for 30 years so I things that I would never have connected the dots unless I had that practical experience so when we talk about the urinary bladder we about um a muscle that stores urine and releases urine so we have this muscle that surrounds your bladder okay it we look at the Common Thread to all these bladder problems it problem with the nervous system I going to explain why we have a valvular system that involves smooth muscle as well as the neurological Supply and the main control with urine elimination really stems from your brain it gray matter not that you need to know that but there that is in control of this bladder okay and then connects to the nervous system and this part of the brain is very vulnerable and sensitive to a thymine deficiency a B1 deficiency in fact other parts of the autonomic nervous system that bladder control are also very vulnerable to vitamin B1 deficiencies I found some fascinating information which I share Down Below in the description on the link the very strong link between a B1 deficiency and your bladder problem that you bladder is overworking or underworking B1 seems to be Common Thread and this also makes sense if you look at a diabetic right when we there people who have bladder problems now if you watch some of my other videos you saw this huge connection between diabetes and peripheral neuropathy problems okay I numbness the bottom of the feet or the pain the bottom of the feet relates to a B1 deficiency I diabetics having just general problems with their autonomic nervous system and there autonomic neuropathy so anytime you have a problem with neuropathies like nerve problems you really want to look at this B1 because there B1 is involved in the myelin sheath production around the nerve and B1 is also necessary for the production of energy especially if it carbohydrates or glucose and so the more carbohydrates or glucose that are used by the body okay the more B1 is needed now a B1 deficiency in the brain can even starve off the energies of certain neurons in the brain and cause a lack of function in those brain neurons as in this case that part of the brain that controls the bladder actually is shrinking and you the entire control system and this can be a very common thing when we age especially if someone pre-diabetic or they have chronic insulin resistance which is very common it population and this is another reason why so many people get so much relief when they start to cut the carbs out of the diet and a relief with bladder issues so it is true that your bladder problems could be coming from let a prostate enlargement or a prolapsed bladder if you disinfection in your bladder or of course you water before you go to bed or you have I don are valid but there more common involved in all of these bladder issues and that is a B1 deficiency and if you don okay you may end up at the doctor office getting more medication maybe a surgery and not fully fixing this problem so here are some simple things you can do you need to First correct the B1 deficiency and I would recommend correcting it with two different types of B1 one is a fat soluble B1 called benphotamine and two is a natural water-soluble regular B1 but you want to make sure it I would take both of these remedies for about two to three months okay because if you are very very deficient it going to take a while to build up but for most people they should start seeing Improvement within the first two weeks now number two you want to stop the depleting of B1 there can deplete B1 but the most common thing is a high carb diet so you need to get on a low carb diet okay and that also includes doing intermittent fasting now the next thing you can do which I highly recommend is based on this you have two types of receptors in the bladder okay for urine you have mechanical receptors which involve pressure or volume of urine okay but you also have chemoreceptors which involve the concentration of urine so for example if you don of urine because maybe you drinking a lot your urine can be very very concentrated and despite having a lot of urine you might just need to go yet when you go not a lot comes out so just by drinking enough fluid through the day and I and a half liters of fluid not past six or seven o can dilute the urine to the point where the need for urination is less at night and you can also try that as well in addition to drinking this extra water you may also benefit from adding apple cider vinegar to your water why because apple cider vinegar can greatly help your blood sugars okay especially if you have insulin resistance I of videos on this apple cider vinegar is like a real simple thing to do you put one to two tablespoons in your water when you drink it and it can greatly help your blood sugars and then you might find based on how much caffeine you consume is to reduce the caffeine beverages to maybe a small cup of coffee in the morning but not a lot of coffee that has caffeine because the caffeine can really affect your bladder in a big way and just by reducing your caffeine that can to make a huge difference now the last thing I would recommend is to manually massage the bladder okay why because your bladder over time can be congested it could be atrophied and if you press into your bladder within your tolerance and just kind of massage around that area and then you might find that you need to urinate right after that I used to recommend this in practice and it really helped stimulate the bladder to actually get more tone into the bladder and to help push out some of the residual urine that could be potentially sitting in your bladder for too long now there are many other things that can cause a B1 deficiency Beyond just sugar and carbs okay and I really highly recommend that you watch this video on that topic right here	Success
The #1 Overlooked Cause of Artery Calcification	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzzSSvp4hlI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now I heart I coronary artery classification vascular calcification but there cause that I recently found through reading a book which I link down below which I think is pretty common and I haven and I think you should know about it especially if you want to prevent calcification of your arteries and this additional cause is called lactic acidosis now when I mentioned lactic acidosis or maybe lactic acid you might associate that with um kind of a burning you feel after you exercise in your muscles right you might think of that but lactic acidosis goes way beyond that lactic acidosis occurs as a byproduct of glucose metabolism and both lactic acidosis and lactate in your blood are associated with a lot of additional problems okay like sudden death from heart attack thrombosis which means you in your arteries panic attacks autonomic nervous system dysfunction which could include a lot of other problems even like in bipolar schizophrenia sepsis which is a systemic infection certain arrhythmia problems like ventricular fibulation and liver disease and definitely diabetes and even cancer and restless leg syndrome but my primary focus today is to show you this connection between lactic acidosis and hypoxia in your arteries okay hypoxia that the next consequence of that is a calcification so vascular calcification can definitely come from this hypoxia which is caused by this acid situation in your blood called lactic acidosis and so calcification in the arteries is not just from old age it you know consuming too much dietary calcium or even just a lack of vitamin K2 now there reasons why someone might develop some version of lactic acidosis one is they too much sugar in the diet can then cause this abundance of lactate and that can develop into lactic acid so anything that can increase the metabolism of glucose is called glycolysis like consuming too much sugar can create this problem the other common link that was discussed in this book which you just need to be aware of is an overactive sympathetic dominant situation you too much in the flutter fight and basically we stress chronic stress is very similar to constantly eating chronic large doses of sugar because stress puts you into this flight of fight mode and you basically using sugar okay as your fuel source both from adrenaline as well as cortisol cortisol is a hormone adrenaline is a neurotransmitter but another name for cortisol is a glucocorticoid because it it uses glucose right but adrenaline also will activate and release a lot of sugar and this can very easily develop this lactic acidosis situation metformin causes as well metformin has a warning sign on the label uh it can cause lactic acidosis why because one of the big problems or side effects from metformin is lactic acidosis now even Warfarin a very common drug to block vitamin K1 to help thin your blood so you don has a side effect of vascular calcification because it can produce lactic acidosis also statin drugs which help block cholesterol also have a side effect of this calcification problem as well and lactic acidosis also drinking too much alcohol will do it and even if you over train if you exercise too much you can develop a lot of lactic acid I wouldn develop calcium deposits from that but it can definitely put you in a state of lactic acidosis and when you have lactic acidosis the pH of your blood starts going down that means it acidic and probably the first symptom you problems it hard to breathe hard to get oxygen because you need a certain pH for that you especially in the leg muscles but there is an effective remedy for lactic acidosis that you need to know about if you have enough B1 thymine chances are you probably won acid in the first place so of course the deeper remedy of lactic acidosis is to find out what consuming too many carbs are you eating too much sugar well then go on keto are you going through stress are you in this chronic flutter fight mode well there to lower that but B1 can vary effectively pull you out of this lactic acidosis and also it will counter the complications from consuming high amounts of carbohydrates as well as the complications from diabetes as well as the side effects from being under this chronic state of sympathetic dominance or stress B1 is the best vitamin for stress in fact I about this before when you take B1 it really helps nervous agitation this buildup of energy this restlessness so B1 will help with that because you actually curbing or reducing this these effects of lactic acidosis you breathe better when you take Natural B1 so B1 is really good to pull someone out of anxiety and the symptoms or side effects from lactic acidosis so B1 can actually also help you with hypoxia which is a lack of oxygen in your in your vascular system it can help balance out the pH B1 has also been known to directly help inhibit thrombosis or clotting so it the heart and of course B1 is also good to inhibit this calcification buildup in the arteries and we all know that consuming too much alcohol will really deplete your B1 and so that common cause of why someone would end up with a B1 deficiency you know I live in a farm and we have cattle and when we first bought this cattle we you know we were asking Farmers around what do we need for cattle do we need to supplement their diet with vitamins whatever and many of the farmers around our area said you you should also buy large amounts of baking soda and I like why do you need baking soda oh well because they can develop lactic acidosis so if you look up why a cow would develop lactic acidosis you will find it many grains okay too many refined carbohydrates a cow is meant to consume grass in plants and weeds not grains and if a cow has lactic acidosis they can become very depressed and active not be around the rest of the cows they can get diarrhea they can get dehydration and they can die and unfortunately some of these Farmers just go ahead and treat these cows with baking soda or some type of alkalizing agent okay instead of really looking at the underlying mechanism a cow designed to be actually that acidic like our stomachs it slightly alkaline in its fermentation of grass so this is just another example of how grains and sugar and refined carbs are not meant to be in our diet and number three make sure you have enough B1 natural B1 not the synthetic thymine but natural B1 in your diet if you potentially could have this issue now I think the next most important video for you to watch would be to learn all the underlying causes of a B1 deficiency so that way you you understand the whole picture and I put that video up right here check it out	Success
The 5 Nutrient Deficiencies Behind Depression	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today I want to talk about five nutritional deficiencies that can definitely cause depression from a physical level I serious Deep dive into DNA and I finding all sorts of fascinating things in relationship to people becoming susceptible to nutritional deficiencies on top of having a fairly decent diet and out of all the things that DNA can definitely influence the mood is right at the top of the list now I just want to clarify something when you at a DNA test you levels of neurotransmitters or vitamins or hormones things like that you looking at Gene variations or alterations between people and there are certain genes that can give you susceptibility to having more of a problem with a certain thing than someone else and I vitamins that can affect neurotransmitters so today I talk about the five nutrients in relationship to them being the most common reason for depression and when I get done with the list I don taking all of these vitamins okay I just recommend taking one at a time so that way you really know which one is involved in your mode now let with number one it deficient in B12 you able to make serotonin now b12 is involved with a lot of different things in the body but I want to focus more on your mood so B12 is absolutely necessary essential for making the neurotransmitter serotonin and there can be several genes involved with why you in the transfer of B12 but the point is if you have a problem with this genetically but it satisfy B12 now I consuming animal Meats okay I assuming that you a vegan because that could be the reason why you is in red meat it an animal protein the other reason is that your stomach acid is not very concentrated so you have like this weak stomach acid where you don acid and the way that you know you don have enough acid is that you actually have acid reflux okay it through that valve on the top of your stomach if you have acid reflux heartburn gerd then what you need to do before you even take B12 and start taking betaine hydrochloride okay and I put a link down below of what video to watch best source of B12 you have a choice you can either do a methylcobolamine or hydroxy B12 okay do not take this synthetic version of B12 called cyanocobolamine now the second thing I would try is folate okay folate and I not talking about the synthetic version folic acid I you are deficient in folate okay and there 30 to 40 percent of the population based on their genetics they have this problem with this very specific Gene called MTHFR now normally folate is in dark leafy green vegetables and to fix this problem you don folic acid in fact you want to make sure you don synthetic version in your supplements or even in they put it in like an enrichment for nutritional yeast you want the unfortified version of nutritional yeast but the nutrient that you need to take is called a methylfolate in fact it doctors as a natural antidepressant folate is involved with a lot of things and if you lot of problems you could be weak you could be tired you could be lethargic but you can also be depressed and you might even be good to get a a supplement that has both B12 and folate and take those together so you that has like the methylfolate and the methylcobolamine I know I told you to take these separately but with these two especially if we talking about genetic issues um it probably a good idea to take those together because they do work together all right so you take these for a few days see how you feel and if you feel great then I wouldn even worry about going on to the next three deficiencies okay I would just focus on this right here and then now we know that was your big problem and the question is how long would you take those well if you truly have a genetic problem you would have to take those the rest of your life let your depression does not lift when you take B12 or folate what would be the next thing to take that would be vitamin D3 vitamin D3 is called the happy vitamin because it Sunshine right now there that you can get from the Sun that can elevate your mood but vitamin D definitely if you going to likely be depressed in fact I would venture to say that great majority of people who are depressed have very low vitamin D levels so vitamin D is involved with so many things the immune system inflammation your blood sugars and the production of not just serotonin but dopamine as well and recently when I genetic reports and I with various people I would say like so far like 80 of them have a problem with the vitamin D receptor so either they converting the inactive to the active form of vitamin D very easily or they not able to absorb vitamin D very easily so this simple solution is to start taking vitamin D3 now how much I would recommend taking about 20 000 IUS especially if you depressed now if you it might not be a bad idea to take 50 000 I use once a week after you try vitamin D3 you go on to number four thymine B1 now A deficiency B1 can definitely make you depressed but it can also make you have anxiety and also um highly irritated like you have no patience and you and you have a lot of nervous energy and tension that you can most common reason for a B1 deficiency is the over consumption of refined carbohydrates and sugars okay yeah so that biscuits waffles pancakes that type of things if you start taking B1 probably take three to four minutes maybe five and you will see a change okay it going to lift you up it you feel better um then you know you definitely need to change your diet but B1 can definitely affect your mood mainly for anxiety but definitely for depression as well the last one is zinc zinc is involved in many many different biochemical reactions but if you zinc which a lot of depressed people are you making neurotransmitters I think the reason why people might be deficient in zinc could be a genetic problem it can also be a diet issue they are a vegetarian or vegan because zinc is in red meat and animal products and also shellfish and seafood those are the five nutrients that I would recommend taking one by one excluding the first two take them together if you have depression and anxiety now there are many other things you can do to also improve your mood probiotics is a really big one so get a good probiotic because your microbes make neurotransmitters as well and whatever into your gut is going to affect you up here especially if you had antibiotics okay there after about of antibiotics and they stay depressed because they never replenish the microbes so anytime you ever take an antibiotic also take a probiotic at the same time the next thing is fasting start getting on an intermittent fasting program I would say like a pattern of um 18 hours of fasting and six hour eating window would be perfect to help bring up your mood when you fast you fix your brain you fix a lot of things in the body and definitely your mood will go up and of course I combining that with keto both the ketogenic diet and fastened together will usually fix a depression and then of course being out in the sun can actually increase your mood as well as regular exercise just to keep the stress off the body and stimulate certain genetics that can actually elevate your mood and so if I depression I would want to know all of the key factors involved in getting rid of it and the next most important video would be this one right here you should check it out	Success
The MOST Important Nutritional Protocol for HIV/AIDS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgybqwSQQSI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I Professor Harold Foster what really causes AIDS and I thought it was fascinating because it involves nutrition let me explain when you have this virus HIV which stands for human immunodeficiency virus over time if the immune system is weak that can shift to AIDS which stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome now age is a condition where you basically don an immune system anymore because that virus targets a key player within the immune system it of the entire team I mean if you playing football and you don good quarterback you can can kind of an essential key player in this whole thing well as far as your immune system the T helper cell is called CD4 is that quarterback without that key player the T helper cell your immune system cannot coordinate with the other players and launch the attacks the defense systems it can provide for any protection and so this T helper cell is such a vital essential player involved in your immune system and without it you sorts of pathogenic secondary infections tumors cancer that can result from not having that key player and on top of that the virus can then keep reproducing reproducing reproducing and just forever a lot of different viruses have very clever strategies for their survival which is pretty bizarre because a virus technically is not alive it genetic material wrapped in a Sac that can only live off the host Metabolism and Machinery so it mystery whether it the point is that HIV can encode for glutathione it has the exact same gene that you have when you make glutathione and so glutathione is the key antioxidant for all of your cells it like the most important antioxidant but it immune system and so this is what this virus does it starts making glutathione and in the process it depletes your selenium uh and three other amino acids and these are all building blocks to make glutathione so it depletes the precursors leaving you high and dry now this is really important to know because if you can just Supply these three amino acids and selenium you can hopefully build up your glutathione and prevent the transition from the HIV virus to the full-blown AIDS syndrome and so the other amino acids that get depleted which are precursors are cysteine glutamine and tryptophan so Professor Harold Foster uses this protocol in Africa for AIDS patients and apparently it there are several other viruses that also use the same mechanism that you should be aware of hepatitis at C hepatitis B and the virus Coxsackie so this protocol would probably help those individuals with those viruses as well I mean even the code discoverer of HIV he said this AIDS is characterized as this persistent oxidative stress and balance as well as the glutathione deficiency now glutathione has everything to do with getting rid of free radical damage and lowering this oxidative stress in the body and so then the person just really has no chance of fighting off these secondary infections in tumors because it just overwhelms the body there sucks up your selenium that then creates a major deficiency of this tea helper cell and then a lowered T helper cell will directly decrease selenium and then the decrease selenium decreases the T helper cell so it it downward spiral so this is the protocol that I would take if I had AIDS okay in addition to doing other things number one I would take 400 micrograms of selenium which is double what the high end should be I would also take the three amino acids cysteine glutamine and tryptophan so those are the four natural remedies that this professor recommends but I would add one more thing I would add something called NAC NAC can double glutathione so I would add that just to put the icing on the cake but for those out there that have HIV I think it this as a as a deeper understanding of something that you could try I mean you have nothing to lose and unfortunately when you very difficult to find natural remedies that literally have no toxicity but you know selenium does a lot more than just act as a precursor for glutathione it involved in the conversion of the inactive thyroid hormone to the active thyroid hormone it also helps prevent cancer but I have a lot more to say about selenium in this video right here check it out	Success

Why You Are TIRED All the Time	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4kCN3Lgvdc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we the oh my goodness the deeper source of your fatigue now I will say this I am an expert in this area simply because I been tired a good portion of my life and I overcame it so I have something very important I want to share I remember driving down the street with my wife in my late 20s being completely exhausted trying to find a healthy store to find some vitamin to give me energy it never worked I had tons and tons of vitamins and did know what was going on so if I can teleport this video back in time and show it to myself this video would have solved my problem if I really understood how the body makes energy and also this is going to be very motivating to you especially because you finally understand what really is behind fatigue in general because you can take various vitamins and energy drinks and try to boost your energy and and more coffee but that doesn problem and if you go to any of these 7-Elevens you counter this huge section 5H Hour Energy Drinks everything starts with this mitochondria what is the mitochondria it cells that produces energy if you have any aspects of fatigue even if you exercise and you run out of gas really fast or even if you have many of the different problems the health problems that most people have this mitochondria is at the root of it in fact most diseases come directly from this mitochondria so what is the pondria it a battery making machine because food directly can be converted into a chemical form of a battery so you can use it and so the energy battery itself is called ATP so the mitochondria is actually the battery maker and the ATP is the actual battery and whether you took biochemistry or not this might help you to understand the Simplicity of what going on with the massive complexity of what mitochondria maybe you have or you haven thing right that battery maker okay so it comes right before the battery maker Because the actual battery maker is connected to it the kreb cycle gets everything prepared and ready and helps strip out some of these electrons but we have to somehow extract these electrons from the food that you eat and since we topic of food certain foods have more energy than other foods and so if you living on Ultra processed foods it going to be almost impossible to extract energy from that simply because it dead there there and on top of that there of nutritional factors in food that we need that the battery maker assembly line requires in each step of the assembly line okay you need B1 B2 B3 folic acid B12 magnesium manganese selenium vitamin C and something else called co-enzyme Q10 so these are the helper molecules that are essential for making this battery now there very important enzyme that making ATP it that you needed to know that but what interesting about this ATP enzyme is that it turbine it spins it helps to generate energy but it so it would take like a 100,000 of these little enzymes to be the same width as one hair okay so they they and every time they rotate one rotation they produce three atps and so how fast do they rotate well they roughly about 7,000 to 9,000 rotations every every single minute so you can imagine how much ATP is generated I mean just one enzyme you 27,000 atps per minute now if we just look at one cell and determine how many mitochondria is in that one cell you looking at on average between a, to 2500 mitochondria per cell and how many cells do you have in your body you have 10 trillion cells incredible now check this out a healthy person makes a massive amount of ATP the actual weight of that ATP would be equivalent to your own weight so if I weigh 180 pounds I make 180 pounds of ATP every single day that would be equivalent to 12200 Watts which comes out to about 282 AA batteries now that might not seem like a lot of wattage but your body is very efficient at using this energy but the fascinating thing about this ATP is it not really stored it demand so if you exercising or moving you generate nearly as much as if you were exercising the point is that this ATP doesn used okay it turns into ADP which then can be recycled back to ATP and ADP does get stored but ADP gets recycled about a thousand times a day okay into ATP and so at any given time during the day you have really only a quarter of a kilogram of ATP that as you start exercising that ATP generation goes way way way up now the next question is if we don ATP what energy do we store well there two fuel sources you have sugar stored as glycogen in your muscle in your liver which it probably have 1,700 calories worth of stored glycogen and soon as you deplete it your body is going to require more sugar or glycogen if you that sugar but you also store energy as fat and once your fat adapted you can tap into this fat a lot easier because you lowering your carbohydrates and you become very efficient at burning fat then you can very easily use that fat as energy and have that go through this KB cycle but if you you quick because you haven fat fuel you energy and so this is why the ketogenic diet is so important for your energy first of all you get more ATP from ketones and fat then you do glycogen or sugar and secondly you have a lot of fat uh Reserve to tap into I mean the average person who about a 100,000 calories of of fat on their body compared to the glycogen storage which is only like 1,700 enough for one day so with my problem way back when I was in my late 20s I would consume pure carbohydrates okay and my energy would come up when I would eat and then it would come crashing down because I ran out of energy and I required more sugar or more carbs to get my energy I was completely dependent on carbs I didn then but I was always tired especially in my head even when I would wake up in the morning I would be so tired and I couldn later in the morning or even the midday so what 70% of all your ATP is used by your brain your brain Hogs a lot of this ATP so if there go around for various reasons your brain why we have so many problems with dementia add brain degenerative disorders mood disorders I mean try to be depressed when you have a lot of energy available with your mitochondria it reflect back on the times that you were depressed chances are you were also tired at the same time so the first clue about getting energy is to get on the ketogenic diet so then you can supply your body with a quick source of fuel which is more efficient to you can not only make more ATP but then so you can tap into this energy reserve a lot quicker and not be stuck uh with this machine that as your fuel it yeah research now has shown that the primary source of oxidative stress in cells is leakage of oxygen and these electrons from the mitochondria and this leakage increases when the key nutrients or protective molecules are missing in like co-enzyme Q10 especially if the person drugs that deplete that nutrient that a really important nutrient to help transport electrons now just so happens that that biochemical pathway that involves the co-enzyme Q10 which is needed to generate energy um is the same pathway that we make cholesterol and so the drug Statin which basically inhibits that enzyme also inhibits Coen have Q10 and this is why one of the biggest side effects from people taking statins involves muscle uh problems weak muscles inflamed muscles muscle disorders lack of energy because think about just in general uh your muscles need energy to function I mean this is how we move you can imagine how much mitochondri is in your muscles and how much Coenzyme Q10 that we need in our muscles in fact if you wanted to consume something with high amounts of co-enzyme Q10 you want to eat muscle okay like red meat fish things like that and the food that has the highest amount would be organ Meats liver and especially heart okay extract you can probably get in supplements but you know people don heart but um it lot of coin Q10 but you have to also realize that your body makes co-enzyme Q10 so it dependent on the diet you can make it as well if you have all the co-actors that allow it to be generated and so all those co-actors especially B vitamins are needed to allow coenzyme Q10 to work so just as a side note uh if you Statin if you you chances are your coenzyme Q10 is very very low so you should start taking that there will put down below um about EXC exercise they tested like athletes versus people who don and they gave them Coen mq10 so in both groups they found significant Improvement in endurance so you can go longer without being tired and now you know why because that Coen and Q10 is necessary in the generation of ATP as well as acting as an an oxident to protect you against all this free radical damage that exercise so one big side effect from statins too is you just run out of gas really quick especially if you exert yourself or you exercise now as far as the food that you should be eating you want food that contains a lot of electrons and a lot of life and a lot of energy so you can extract the energy from that if you the average American consumes processed foods I think it calories in the grocery store are Ultra processed foods they don the actual food it literally impossible to get energy if you nutrient-dense foods with red meat at the top of the list I will tell you when I have red meat I have more energy it not just the iron that that helps build up my hemoglobin there factors in that meat that give me energy not just Coen mq10 but just a lot of energy generating factors there another interesting study about this I just found this I think it I will put the link down below but what they did is they wanted to test the nutrition factors in red meat okay versus the plant-based meats that they artificial meats and so if you look at the nutrition labels on both of them they look very similar right look healthy but what they found is out of 190 biomarkers they found 171 out of one for 90 were significantly higher than the plant-based fake meat type uh food if you want to call it that the point is that when you eat nutrient-dense foods like truly nutrient-dense Foods uh there of things in there that can actually help you get healthy and instead of trying to make food just taste good I would focus on trying to help grow your food that more food that is nutrient dense because what they meat now is just to try to mimic the taste of it the texture of it but what about the nutrition the other really really really important thing about um your mitochondria and actually producing more mitochondria is exercise hands down that is the number one way to reduce more mitochondria this is another reason why you should consistently exercise on a regular basis and that override a lot of other bad things that you might have done in your past and also if you have any type of diseases or uh problems currently this can help um counter that why because a lot of disease comes from damage to the mitochondria and if you and you with in a minute fasting that fasting triggers another thing called autophagy autophagy is recycling old damaged proteins but also the recycling of the mitochondria how cool is that and then you how you is the stuff that I wish I knew back in my early 20s actually before that I wish I knew this in kindergarten I would have saved uh myself a lot of years of fatigue now a couple other things that could increase your mitochondria Cal therapy I do that on a regular basis and man do I feel better after doing it if you that you can do kind of like a partial cold immersion with a cold shower the most difficult part about this is when you submerge um around your heart because your heart is pumping and it trying to keep you warm and it like the the most vulnerable area but you can always do half of your body cold and you there increase increase the reproduction of mitochondria and actually help repair some of the mitochondria as well like sulfurane and the cruciferous vegetables and the broccoli mic grains as well as the radish micro grains it different foods there actually are quite a few phytonutrients that when you consume those they help your mitochondria and then on the flip side it avoiding the refined Foods avoiding the sugar going on keto avoiding chronic stress heavy metals smoking alcohol these are all the things I wish I would have known back in my 20s and also this is the understanding of what the mitochondria really is now because of the censoring and the suppressing of the algorithms on YouTube it difficult to find my content and there a lot of content that I cannot put on YouTube

This SUCKS! - Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LEGd8r84Tc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I know I know I know you don tell me I shouldn picking fights with people I know but you should have saw the other guy no I did not get punched this is poison ivy I get it four times a year I just said a dream last night I was dreaming like wow I didn wake up with this it sucks CU I have to do videos and I do videos every day and but I just decided you know what I just going to do a video anyway and I I happened to me with uh years of prazone and uh also we it relates to stress and is it possible that you could end up with the side effects from pregant Zone by going through chronic stress we talk about that this is hideous maybe I should talk to you like this it little bit no that even look at this I these I don look at it looks disgusting but this looks better so let in cortisol but let me just tell you a quick story about what happened to me in my 20s I was gardening and somehow there was some poison I in there and I got exposed to it and I reacted really bad go to the doctor take the prazone it goes away next year same thing happens this went on for like probably 10 years in a row until the point where my poison ivy reactions on my skin didn so I couldn know from that prazone it created a lot of problems with my body which I to talk about but it you have some type of severe inflammatory skin reaction or other reactions and you need something to help and prazone doesn but a very unfortunately it figured this poison ivy out in fact I don could get close to it I could get maybe a few feet away from it and all of a sudden I it must be in my nervous system because these similar patterns of poison ivy itching start to pop out in certain places rarely on my face but this time it was on my eye which really sucks because now I have to wait for like two weeks before it goes away so why do people take prazone mainly for an anti-inflammatory or some type of immune supressant effect so they give it to people with autoimmune diseases arthritis injuries and even uh if you have an organ transplant it the immune suppressive effects because the immune system will start attacking the new organ that was put in you now the problem with this prazone it comes with a package it gives you side effects if you take higher doses I think like 80 milligrams you could start getting a moon face but I think a lot of people have a subclinical version of this not even taking prazone just by high levels of cortisol and they start developing somewhat of a round moon face in fact I had it when I was under a lot of carbs there is a big association between a condition called Cushing syndrome where you have this high level cortisol uh and uh also Diabetes Type 2 metabolic syndrome polycystic ovarian syndrome things like that a lot of things that are unknown but just realize that prazone is a synthetic version of cortisol and cortisol um is a hormone in the adrenal glands that actually helps your immune system it does a lot It prepares the body for stress situations so to better understand this I you in this medical book right here okay right here a condition called pushings syndrome which the person has high levels of cortisol and the fat is redistributed to their face their belly and like on the top of their shoulders like a hunchback they get a fat pad there and the body is literally taking protein from certain places and turning that into sugar and converting into fat from the thighs the butt so you lose your butt you lose your legs and it goes right to the belly and there lot of problems because you get rosacea spider veins osteoporosis you lose potassium calcium magnesium you also deplete or block vitamin D you don is interesting allergies asthma immune suppression so you to viruses heartburn as well as diabetes because the body is turning its own self protein into sugar at a massive level so you can end up with diabetes so that was Cushing syndrome but I think there is a subclinical situation going around with people because you don with that overnight it gradual slow process with this high level of cortisol over period of time so you might have some of those symptoms because of stress now if you look at the cause of Cushing syndrome um you know they talk about genetics they talk about a tumor on the adrenal gland or maybe a tumor on your pituitary gland which by the way if you have a tumor on the pituitary gland um you a hyperpigmentation your skin will be darker but also Cushing syndrome can occur with animals you know they can have tumors and they can create these problems but here can also create Cush syndrome and all of those effects so pregnazon comes with a package you get high blood glucose diabetes you get heart problems arhythmia problems palpitation even Strokes psychosis you can have all sorts of mental side effects you become highly irritable usually with the lower doses but then when you get higher doses you can get depression you crave sugar in salt and you retain fluids which makes sense from several things but um you know you have to realize if you adrenal stimulation it cortisol that other hormones in the adrenals that control your fluid balance as well but realize that cortisol itself is a glucocorticoid so basically cortisol can affect glucose in a big way it gets your body to run on glucose it messes up glucose metabolism so you can with glucose or sugar very well anymore this is why stress is one of the big causes of insulin resistance and so does prazone cause the side effect of insulin resistance in diabetes so it interesting because a lot of the effects of sugar are similar to the effects of stress this is why you can get off sugar but go through stress and your body will start to uh act like you a couple things you need to know about prazone is that once you start taking it you don fast get with your doctor to make sure you do it gradually because you can have more side effects because when you take a prosome uh the body now depends on that and it stops producing its own cortisol and so if you come off of it too quickly and the adrenals can produce that I mean you can imagine the side effects um because it just doesn bounce back right away for everyone and then sometimes people come off of it and now they get those symptoms that come right back so that with this prazone is that okay it gets rid of your inflammatory conditions and your symptoms but then you come off what you really can forever and the more you take it the more it weakens the system but if you don back so it you depletes a lot of nutrients calcium magnesium potassium zinc B vitamins vitamin C chromium um there uh basically has a whole Channel about prazone I below she has some great information but the point is that prazone and cortisol deplete you of nutrients so if someone is on prazone they should also be taking these nutrients and also especially as they come off prazone and that way they hopefully so whether you or whether you stress let cortisol the number one thing is to do whatever you can to lower your stress wherever that from people is it coming from videos that you news like anything that stress you just have to deal with that the other thing that you can do and I released a couple videos on this topic um a lot of times when you have this sustained chronic uh mental stress the body doesn the physical stress and mental stress so being chased by a tiger could be equivalent to going through this chronic stress to some level so I think uh a good way to counter that is to do uh physical work exercise of course long walks especially in nature would be good uh also there certain Hobbies like in the Arts or even music huge benefit to lower cortisol and stress because it shifts your attention off the worry and worrying is the worst form of stress because you solving any problems you thinking about them and you up the problems so the more that you can your mind off of it and focus on something else the better from a nutrition angle magnesium potassium and B1 and uh vitamin D almost forgot about vitamin D and uh I should mention this too I forgot one of the side effects of prazone is a loss of cognitive function memory Focus brain fog another thing that is really good for U lowering cortisol is ashwagandha there is really good and then the next thing you could do is just focus on your breathing your breathing can put you in a state of relaxation calmness it can help lower cortisol by slowing the breath down uh I have videos on this but if you can slow your breath down to six breaths per minute that seconds out um and you control it it can help pull you out of a panic attack it can help you sleep it can help reduce cortisol and there we might have that out already ready so check in the description but it device okay that we looking at the oxygen we your pulse rate there extract off the pulse rate and there technology called heart rate variability that measures this uh stress and Recovery cycle because that way you can kind of see where you really improve something if you can measure it so this is a very good objective and visual way of looking inside your body and seeing where you really at with your stress and Recovery your ability to adapt to stress and uh it I will um put that link down below when I want the complete list of all 25 ways to lower cortisol I have a link for that press the link down below you go to my website download it for free and start applying this information for your own

14 Earliest Signs of Nutritional Deficiencies	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW_pBDhJSkk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we earliest signs of nutritional deficiencies that being said there are a lot more nutrients and I have a complete list of all the earliest signs of specific nutrient deficiencies on our website and I so you can download when we today we starting with vitamin A what would be the first sign of a vitamin A deficiency that would be difficulty seeing in the dark especially if you night and it a really hard time seeing in the dark that is one of the first signs of a vitamin A deficiency all right now what about the B complex well I to talk about B1 uh in the complete document you vitamins but the first sign of a B1 deficiency is nervous tension you feel this buildup of nervous energy that you kind of like you could say a feeling of some stress buildup and this is why when you take B1 that just goes right away within like two to three minutes next one is Vitamin C what would be the first sign of that that would be a pink toothbrush so let you notice there maybe not bleeding gums but let your gums are a little swollen or red that foods that are highest in vitamin C raw sauerkraut bell peppers berries lemons limes okay what about vitamin D well one of the First Signs would be bone pain so you can press on your shins right now or your breast bone and if there suspect a vitamin D deficiency one other symptom that I noticed is that your lower back is just aching suspect a vitamin D of course there other symptoms for vitamin D but we just talking about one of the first signs all right what about vitamin E one of the first signs of a vitamin E deficiency is weakness in your muscles if you find that you stairs and you are heavier and your muscles are weaker or it could be any type of let you muscles feel weak suspect a vitamin E deficiency all right what about K1 well excessive bruising okay you bruise easily what about K2 a buildup of tartar is a vitamin K2 deficiency because vitamin K2 keeps the calcium out of the tissues of the body what about calcium one of the first symptoms of a Calcium deficiency is uh chronic cough irritation with your throat but especially if you have this chronic coughing that just won take some calcium and Watch What Happens what about an iodine deficiency well that can show up in many things but the first symptom would be breast tenderness and then that can lead into what called fibrocystic breast where you have the these little cyst just suspect uh any type of cyst on your body being an iodine deficiency what about a sodium deficiency well that typically is going to be overall weakness not necessarily in the muscles but it could be but overall you weak and you you lost that get up and go but this deficiency can also affect your sleep being but there which I it especially if you the ketogenic diet okay what about magnesium the first symptom of a magnesium deficiency is a loss of energy because of magnesium making ATP you just don anymore but also uh leg cramps okay especially when you since we going to throw one more in there is potassium deficiency one of the first symptoms to show up with that would be when you go to sleep at night and you hear that pounding in your inner ear on the pillow very loud you should never hear that because you just ate a lot of carbohydrate that locked up your potassium and you pulse rate in inner ear just take some pottassium and it will go right away and also a lack of potassium will start increasing the pulse rate too so your pulse rate will still go up all right the next one is the selenium deficiency you maybe some memory issues but definitely a negative cognitive effect and realize selenium can come from a Brazil nut but you don day also from shellfish Seafood uh oysters SE calp as well organ Meats red meats and eggs but selenium is important in many different things including uh making uh glutathione which helps you detox X ify and then we get to zinc which is a very important Trace mineral involved in so many different things one of the first signs of a zinc deficiency is you become out of breath when you exert yourself so let exercise and you just don strength and the the get up and go you need some zinc zinc will also create a lot of other issues especially with lowering of testosterone as well as a lowering of your immune system now to get the complete list on a one-page document click the link down below and go to drberg.com	Success
Ultimate Support for Your Cataracts	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWOOo2VsyRQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I want to talk about the ultimate cure for cataracts cataracts are the leading cause of blindness the main treatment for it is surgery so if there that we can do to prevent it and even if we get it possibly reverse it uh we need to know about this first I want to just share what is a cataract it cloudiness opak andess of the lens of the eye okay and apparently what causes it is too much oxidative stress now what does oxidative stress mean think about oxidation is kind of rusting out something I was raised in Wisconsin we have a lot of salt and we have a lot of rain and we have snow and our cars rusted out so when you think about oxidation think about rusting we have a lot of oxidation and not enough antioxidants okay so that thing against this oxidation so if we have this situation going on in the eye chances are you catac so where does this oxidation come from it comes mainly from sugar right if you have high levels of sugar in your blood there are four main tissues that are affected kidney nerves arteries and the eye so in other words this high sugar in your blood ends up with high sugar in your eye and about onethird of it converts to something called sorbitol and sorbitol tends to accumulate in the lens of the eye Sorbitol is a sugar alcohol and it ends up in the lens of the eye because when it accumulates it creates inflammation it creates what glycation so just think of it like the the proteins are binding to the sugar Like Glue in your lens and that creates the cloudiness now what I didn about the lens which I just learned about which is actually quite fascinating early on when we were very young the lens of their eye does have certain things in it like mitochondria but as we get older they tend to go away and so the oxygen and the nutrients in The Lens comes from the fluid in the eye but the front part of the eye okay it called the anterior part has a single layer of cells that do have mitochondria which means this they susceptible to having damage if there high levels of sugar and when the mitochondria the energy factories of the cell get damaged they can really put out a lot of um oxidation which creates free radicals which create an instability it creates inflammation in the lens and it going to become very opaque now the sorbitol doesn it also ends up in the retina of the eye it also ends up in the cells that make myelin in your nerves and it also pulls in a lot of fluid into the eye increasing pressure as in glycom so when people get cataracts a lot of times they also have glycom they also have like macular degeneration uh they have all sorts of issues so right off the B if you need to change your diet and you need to get rid of sugar immediately but now I want to talk about how to undo this process right if you have it and uh let first I want to just kind of tell you what this word carnosine means let me move my head carnosine what is carnosine carnosine comes from the word K which means flesh which actually implies meat and the carine molecule actually works within the mitochondria and that what carnosine in the mitochondria act as a pH buffer okay so if something reasons it can help buffer the pH because that acidity can create damage also ELC carnosine works as a very powerful antioxidant remember over here we want more antioxidants it also gives a anti-glycation effect that glycation is like glue that kind of keeps the protein and the sugar together and makes them unusable so carnosine is anti-glycation it this molecule is very good for preventing in the reversal of catx but the problem is it can the eye so that something called n acetal to this carnosine compound because this and acetal part allows it to penetrate to go right through the eye with drops and deliver this antioxidant anti-glycation type thing this something to actually reduce the acidity going on because of the high level of sugar so this is really important in kind of repairing also the mitochondria which came from eating too much sugar usually I found some interesting research and I put it down below uh one paper uh involved 50,000 people with significant results not with just with cataract but with also glaucoma Immaculate degeneration another research paper talked about a reversal after five months with a 1% solution but then when you go on uh Amazon to try to find a product like this you can it all you see is NAC for pets like dogs or horses so there used for dogs or horses that are getting uh cataracts but why not humans that really interesting so you have to get this off of Amazon and search for a good product that has good reviews make sure it carnosine and you want to take one to two drops of this in each eye two to three times per day now I recommend taking some zinc okay because zinc is also something that can help prevent cataracts it antioxidant plus NAC depends on on it you need enough zinc for it to exist in the body so zinc and NAC is going to be what I recommend of course the zinc won take it orally now you may see results uh pretty quick depending on how severe it is but it could take weeks to months before it completely goes away however I limitation of matter and of course it may not work for you but it safe and the investment that it would cost to buy some is pretty low and potentially if you could do something that was pretty safe that could reverse this without surgery it option so anyway I put some links down below to talk about some of the research that I just mentioned and if you have not visited drberg.com to sign up for my newsletter to get some unfiltered content that you YouTube I put a link down below check it out	Success
Rid Throat and Sinus Mucus with SALT	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so if you have any type of excuse me one second oh man any problem with mucus in your throat today we about how to get rid of it using salt very very simple this is part of a series of three different videos to address this problem from different angles so whether you have a sinus mucus or mucus in the inner ear or coming from your tonsils or up from the throat we going to get into it so I you know this but salt is is really good for anything bacterial fungal yeast and mold even if you think about um how they cure meat they add salt to actually raw meat to stop any type of bacterial growth and even when you make sauerkraut you have this bacteria that is fermenting this cabbage but then when they want to stop it they add salt to it then it stabilizes this stage of making sourkraut I want to explain what salt does to these microbes okay we take a look at my little chart right here if we put salt on either a bacteria a fungus yeast or a mold the salt concentration is a lot more outside than inside right in inside you have water and water tends to flow towards a concentrated salt mixture so the water is going to move out of the cell into the extra cellular area right here turning this bacteria into a shriveled dehydrated dead particle so the salt will kill bacteria fungus mold and yeast through dehydration another cool thing that the salt will do is it lot of times people get this really thick mucus it won bodies well you can use salt to loosen it up how does it do that the same mechanism it takes the water out of the mucus it breaks it up and it thins the mucus so we have two things going on we have the inhibiting of the microbial growth and the killing of microbes and we also have the thinning of the mucus so this is really good for an infection anywhere in your respiratory tract you could have a postnasal sinus drip situation that back part of the sinuses into the throat you could also have a situation where there mucus buildup through the esta tubes on either side and that can end up in the throat as well and so here you are trying to get rid of the throat infection but it keeps coming from the ear so the source is the ear the effect is the throat so you have to be able to handle where it also if it handle that as well so this mucus can be originating from the sinus from the ear or even from the tonsils which are little uh immune glands in the back part of the throat which can swell up especially in children and be a source of infection but really the tonsils are trying to fight off the infection and protect any invading of the microbes deeper into the body so it intends to create defenses and it creates inflammation and a lot of times you end up with a sore throat on occasion some of the mucus could be coming up from the esophagus because you have either acid reflux that esophagus or you could have some mucus that there you can do related to salt from very expensive to very inexpensive so let start with the least expensive thing you can do you can basically take a teaspoon of sea salt now as far as the salt that I recommend I don table salt because they have so many additives in their anti-caking agents and you really don where they got that refined product I would highly recommend uh you find a good rock salt something that has been preserved uh that hasn Plastics and pollution in our oceans a lot of times people will use Himalayan sea salt but I will mention if you going to use one of the therapies that I when you buy one of these units which I own rock salt and so in that case you maybe you don sea salt because that does have a bit more iron but certain units also just use sodium chloride so let example you units you sea salt Himalayan sea salt is a really good one what you you this sea salt and dissolve it in a glass of water and you down just by drinking it down you going to expose everything in your mouth and the throat area to this salt plus the salt and strengthens something called the autonomic nervous system which especially focuses in on this uh flight or fight mechanism it it tends to improve that so many people will get results just from from drinking some salt water so you want to heat up the water to a certain degree so you can dissolve the salt in there so you have the option of drinking it or using it as something you can gargle with right so you just you drink this salt water you gargle it get the back of your throat all exposed to this sea water and you going to start to improve your immune system because it microbe and start loosening up this mucus so salt water gargles are great but just remember when you gargle with this make sure you dilute the salt in the water you may want to also add a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar I like fairchild concentrated and it apple cider vinegar changes the ph and it kills microbes as well so we only going to dehydrate the microbes thin the mucus but we can actually also kill the microbes by adding this Alid of vinegar which is acetic acid now I telling you to put this straight concentrated acid into your body because that if you have a sore throat you want to dilute it like one teaspoon in a glass of water to make it more diluted but both salt and apple cider vinegar works really good for an antibacterial effect as well as an anti-inflammatory effect the next thing you have an option to do is get a nety pot a nety pot is something called a nasal Irrigation in which you to pour some salt water up into your sinuses through here and it come out the other side over the sink so the reason I like that is that you using this diluted salt water and it very gentle to your sinuses you using any chemicals and it seems to really thin the mucus and you will notice that you nose a lot of mucus will come out if you have a postnasal drip all year around suspect a fungal infection or some type of mle growing in your is because that would indicate it hopefully you diet and come off any sugar because sugar feeds this mold and candida and fungus you nasal irrigation netti pot maybe every other day until it down the problem with some people is they get their sinuses scraped out and they might get surgery and now they damage this very delicate layer of skin that has all these good bacteria to protect you against pathogen so in another video I talked about using a drop of diluted kimchi juice and a little cotton swab to add that microbiome into the sinuses to give you relief there that now the next uh thing you can do is use a humidifier which basically turns a liquid into a vapor and so you would use this while you turn it on you put your salt water in there and you let it run all night long so you can actually breathe this into your body into your lungs and it can help to uh in the mucus one more thing I would recommend is to really bundle up and get warm when you a lot of times these infections especially if it the respiratory uh area or even the higher part the upper respiratory um that could be viral and so antibiotics don body up and generate more like a natural fever so you want to bundle up get in your bed stay warm and try to sweat so you can cook these viruses with temperature and so so we kill them with dehydration kill them with an acid kill them with heat and then the next thing you can do is what called halotherapy which is a couple options you can actually uh go somewhere and they have these salt caves that you can go in uh or there machines which basically are like a dry salt machine that puts this dry salt out into the air and they usually come with their own type of salt which is purified sodium chloride and I don use sea salts they may I these Halo therapy machines are a little bit more expensive so if you can afford one they might be worth it now let for example you do this and it not working it could be the source of your infection is coming from an ear infection or some type of microbe in the EST station tubes which can get really clogged up for that you have several options you can just take a drop of this seawat and put it about four drops or five drops in each ear let it go in there kind of Shake It Out and and what that will do it will create a thinning of the mucus through here and kill off those microbes you can also do the same thing with diluted apple cider vinegar not concentrated just a few like maybe four or five drops of that diluted apple cider vinegar in the water one teaspoon per glass and you would put that in each year so you have different options of things you can do based on your feeling comfortable about it there else you can do you can add uh one drop of garlic oil in each here that works really well it kills the microb and allows this thing to clear out and of course you also have this acid reflex thing if that is the problem uh you have to watch my video Down Below on how to get rid of acid reflex but you to know if you have acid reflux because you you might have heartburn you might feel it uh indigestion down here typically this is not going to be the issue it mainly going to be either coming from the sinuses or or even the tonsil so the Garling will really help now on top of all of this I would highly recommend you take vitamin D there data on the relationship between kids that have enlarged tonsils and a vitamin D deficiency kids and adults that have sinus allergies sinus mucus and low vitamin D ear infections okay in people with vitamin D deficiencies and so just the fact that vitamin D receptors are in every single cell in your body including almost every single immune cell it makes sense to take vitamin D and probably at least 20,000 iuse one little extra strategy that I would use instead of taking regular doses of vitamin D for something like this is I would just take 50,000 IUS of vitamin D once a week that way you get this shotgun effect and uh you can actually speed up the clearing of this mucus now if you haven how to get rid of respiratory mucus with salt you have to check that video out I put it up right here	Success
Why Is This Country the MOST OVERWEIGHT in the World (THE REAL REASON)?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2v_jJfbVYQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we number one fattest country in the entire world can you guess what it is go ahead and comment down below we about 94.5% either overweight or obese with an average weight of 225 lbs per person and on top of it this country has the highest rate of diabetes of any other country it the South Pacific it it population of 11,000 now what happened in 1975 there was this huge boom with this mineral called phosphate and this country became one of the richest countries in the world in a short period of time so they had a lot of money they had a lot of cars a lot of buildings and of course with that came corruption until the point where all of this mineral was completely gone it was depleted from the land and this country went into into a deep poverty state where it ever since now the question is what happened to bring this obesity rate from 2% up to I think it 61% we do know they went from their traditional foods to westernized processed food if you want to call it that traditionally they ate a lot of fish they had coconuts fruits they had vegetables they had terot root but they didn had palm oil and coconut oil but they made the shift to more grains process grains uh what we call alra processed foods which also include highly refined seed oils and so some people might blame this inactivity that may be part of it and other people will say it more sodium or more saturated fat and that obesity problem or diabetes so here you have this culture that can no longer grow anything on their soils because it garden 40% of the marine life has been destroyed from pollution nearly 100% of the food is imported they have to import the water which is expensive it actually more expensive than soda they started seeing obesity start at 15 months old and so if we take a look at the guts or the basic building blocks of ultra processed food we have mainly three major major ingredients okay we have artificial starches and these synthetic sugars as well as in corn syrup or glucose syrup the definition of ultra means extreme process means you changing something into something else and you of that food it definition of food is something to nourish the body to give us energy how can you do that with these ingredients and then we we also have these highly inflammatory seed oils I mean seed oils are a highly reactive not very stable fat that can now sit on the shelf for a long period of Time how can it do that because it so when it goes in your body it can create a lot of problems I about insulin resistance I about obesity on a very large scale in fact seed oils are really the only trending item that parallels obesity even more than sugar sugar actually has come down but seed oils have gone straight up in vertical you know when people talk about Ultra processed foods they talk about oh yeah it with saturated fats I mean they might put some saturated fats in there like palm oil and that well but that has a lot less amount of this omega-6 oil I think if I mistaken it compared to the others that are just completely filled with and so what gets people is that when they read the label they don understand what these things are so they don be called like modified food starch or modified corn starch or molto extran the sugars would be corn syrup or glucose syrup and the synthetic seed oils would be of course corn canola or cotton seed or safflower or soy oil now I have a personal friend that has just visited vised these islands and they gave me a lot of information about this topic they these oils but not just that they are also in these other foods and so they create a lot of damage including nutritional deficiencies as well as creating more hunger so it make you want to eat uh and eat and eat but never really be satisfied because there turn off the brain so it constant hunger in a constant inflammatory state it just must be miserable Ultra processed foods should come with a blackbox warning that they put on certain medications to warn people against the serious side effects I mean the side effects from multiprocess food are worse than some of the drugs it should basically say ultrapress maybe food-like stuff with a blackbox warning so people know what going to happen if they eat that that is not the solution the solution starts with education on the Basic Foods that really fit this definition of the word food out of the dictionary and if you want that information I put it in a video right here check it out	Success
Bloating: The Ultimate Indicator of the Right Diet	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q	Dr. Eric Berg DC	probably out of all the things to figure out if you it bloating we intestine this is a tube that long and it has a very large surface area if we open it up and stretch it out the surface area is roughly about 2700 Square ft or about 250 square meters the bottom line is you have a lot of surface area for absorption of food because 90% of all all your digestion and nutrition happens in the small intestine if you get inflammation if you get an infection or you take a medication or you have food allergies all of this can irritate that lining and cut down the surface area of that absorption of nutrients and then you deficiencies vitamin D as well as bios salts you bios salts so if you run in a bile now we can of vile is to get rid of excess cholesterol there sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth that of microbes that normally should be in the large intestine but they wrong place when you eat food especially fiber and things like that you start getting tremendous amounts of bloating because you see fermentation is a different process and that intestine and if it intestin in boy you in the wrong place and it extend and create a lot of bloating pain and disc Comfort there are apparently certain microbes that can help it but generally speaking I wouldn adding more probotics down there because you already have microbes there on the flip side let you just have some type of inflammation or damage or scar tissue in that small intestine why would that be how would you end up with that well usually it comes from eating processed foods early on seed oils the synthetic starches the synthetic sugars too so all that creates inflammation it depletes you of nutrients it feeds the pathogens and now you have this inflammatory condition realize the more inflammation you have the less you can absorb in the small intestine the solution is to do carnivore for a couple months at least to clean out the gut while you also do intermittent fasting it probably be beneficial if you took um ban Hy chloride as an acidifier to actually help strengthen the stomach if you constantly shoving food down this pipe right you don go through it it keeps the the bacteria just growing so we have those two conditions okay but we also have another condition where you don you have bloating and you might have other issues too like constipation and your stool might float okay which means you could be either your gallbladder your pancreas or it could be some type of dysfunction with your digestion so in some cases it might be beneficial to cut back on your fiber okay and then slowly increase it because that way you feeding the microbes you digestion and you have better stool I consume a lot of fiber from Plants right from salads and things like that I don get them from grain or brand because it you have a salad you thing there salad beyond the fiber to the microbes even the phytonutrients can help these microbes to a certain degree but the way to get more microbes is to slowly increase the amount of like salads you eat starting off with maybe a couple cups to then gradually over some weeks more and more and more and more where you day but if you want to increase the diversity of microbes which will make things even better then you use different types of plants you can also do fasting to increase the diversity as well vitamin B1 though is another really uh important factor for constipation because B1 is all about supporting the nervous system another thing that can help that is having enough magnesium uh as well as potassium and even sodium so you need these electrolytes so to prevent cramping of the colon the absolute best way to know if what you eating is the right diet is to see how you blow okay to see if there not if the stools are coming out really good there feeling good then whatever diet you on don another really popular video that little bit more in depth on bloting and if you haven right here check it out	Success
Look Younger Instantly: The Secret	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8dfLN5qpsI	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today I want to talk about how to look younger instantly okay this is what you do very very important start to find some new friends that are a lot older than you and just start hanging out with them and you younger but in all seriousness there really two viewpoints to look at when trying to you know look youthful uh the outside in approach versus the Inside Out approach so many people are focused on trying to look younger from the outside in they facial creams and different things are putting your face to like anti- wrinkle things and creams and lotions and all sorts of things not to mention surgery and those things as well but what about from the inside out what are some things you can do to change your youthful appearance from the inside well let start right at the most important thing and that would be something called age advanced glycation end products that is a combination of a sugar and A protein that is bonded and stuck together these get stuck in the body and they accumulate and they make you look older and they create all sorts of chronic inflammation in chronic disease so if you were to take um I don barbecued ribs for example you have sugar sauce on these ribs and they heated so heat tends to cause this chemical reaction to occur and so there cook like meatloaf for example and it can even be proteins in junk food right that but it can also be the amount of sugar that you own bloodstream and you have heat inside your body and it starts to interact with your own proteins okay you have something in your blood cells called hemoglobin there A1C what is that that is a measurement of how much glycated protein that you have and it gives you a number so you can kind of look at on a scale from good to bad and you can kind of from that determine your blood sugars over a period of three months these ages are behind a lot of problems with just looking old okay but you also have something else that related a e what is that that stands for advanced lip oxidation and products okay that is where you have fat that gets bound to glucose or sugar so ages are are sugar and protein that gets stuck Al are sugar and fat that gets stuck same thing it creates chronic inflammation disease and it accumulates and it makes you look older because think about it you have various um proteins in your body you have a lot of different proteins I mean you have proteins in your tendons your ligaments you have protein in your blood but you also have fat membranes too and then your nervous system and your endocrine system your brain and even every cell in your body has a cell membrane made out of fat let fat with sugar heated deadly for this this process of binding this sugar with this fat you have also uh french fries right because you have high Heats with a starch which is a carb which you can turn into sugar really fast and then the fat the oil that they cook with then you have the cereals and the chips the donuts etc etc now when we talk about um this Al the one that affects the lipids um if we look at just saturated fats and unsaturated fats like seed oils the seed oils are much worse than the saturated fats because they fat and so if you want to look young you better avoid those unsaturated fats because they old really quick and when I use the word oxidation I of like certain parts of your body just like rusting out creating what free radical damage which is another thing that the best way to understand that is think about uh if you had a plate that spinning on your finger right now around a circle and it had different weights on it and if you took one of the weights off it would be out of balance right and it would no longer balance because it not paired anymore it starts to becoming very radical and it starts to damage things too much oxidation and not enough protection like antioxidants you have this thing called oxidative stress and the reason I because this relates directly to your aging if you could just balance this thing out back and bring up your antioxidant levels you can counter all the oxidation in the free radical damage to a major level now as you know other things also oxidize you as well smoking drinking pollution taking drugs you know things like that but what interesting about this you always hear someone say well I know of my grandfather he smoked like a fiend and he died at 100 years old how do you explain that well if you take a look at certain countries where people live a long time like Sardinia for example these people that live in the mountains live a lot longer than people that live at the sea level okay and uh there interesting uh article on this talking about men because the men that lived in the Mountaintop in Sardinia smoke like a fiend so wait a second I thought smoking was bad for you how could this possibly be they should be dead by the time they past a hundred years old well yes they do smoke but they lot of antioxidants and some of the antioxidants they in the cheese that they eat because they grass in the higher altitudes which have much much higher antioxidant levels and those transfer into the milk which goes into the cheese which goes into these people that smoke not to mention all the other antioxidants that they eat and also the lifestyle they doing a lot of ultr processed junk Foods so you really need to look at the whole picture okay if you Foods yet at the same time you other things that are countering that uh then that could explain why you might be surviving a lot longer I live in a certain area where there people who eat junk food but even though they seem to be eating a lot of junk food a lot of them are farmers and they until dark right you have all this physical activity that is so protective against everything it countering all the bad effects from the chewing tobacco and the smoking and all the junk food if you have enough antioxidants to the oxidation then you can we build up our antioxidant levels well we can eat animals that had eaten grass or even a diversified uh group of plants versus animals have just lived on grains or we in a feed lot right they not going to have near the phytonutrients and those phytonutrients are more protective against things in fact I study and the researcher contacted me after six months and says what are you doing I says what do you mean he says let me send you the report so I the page up right now but you can see in this report the level of antioxidants compared to other Farms right so my cattle not only get a lot of exercise because there just mountains up and down and there not even a lot of grass there lot of different weeds and different plants and different herbs which obviously is contributed to these phytonutrients and so when you go to like Europe uh France and Italy we have some cheese where these goats and sheep that have lived on different types of grasses and higher altitudes I think they Viewpoint could be this these antinutrients can create an epigenetic effect just like exercise does right on our bodies when you exercise you actually damage your body that then causes an adaptation and you become stronger the same thing with cold therapy or heat therapy or fasting well what about some of these uh plant-based chemicals right it could be doing the same thing we don time I think we want to build up our own antioxidants and I means from within our body makes these antioxidants there do that okay we can do that by consuming antioxidants like if you were to consume food like cruciferous vegetables the phytonutrients in those cruciferous vegetables like sulfurane for broccoli Sprouts or radishes will actually not only give us some antioxidants it will trigger our genes are enzymes from those genes to make antioxidants another way you can increase your own endogenous antioxidants is through fasting exercise and sleeping and the more antioxidants you have the better you because one thing about our skin our youthfulness we want a good detoxification system we don build up toxic waste and so we need a very healthy liver if you ever take a look at someone who has a bad liver okay their skin is always bad it doesn healthy now all of those things also trigger something else it autophagy Now what is autophagy autophagy is a a condition where your body starts to recycle damage cells and damage things within cells to repurpose them for new cells and theophagy can also help you look younger as well now if we look on the posing scale of that frequent eating eating a lot of sugar eating a lot of grains eating a lot of ultra processed foods will stop autophagy now what do I mean by alra processed foods well if we just take a look at the definition of the word processed what does that mean it means to change something to alter something to modify something as in modified food starch right and then if we add this other word before it called Ultra we okay and making it so dead those are the foods that are on the bottom level that aren chemicals and the more of those foods you eat the older you unhealthier you things are designed to sit on the shelf for a long time and if you think about it even the bugs won other thing about creating a useful appearance is to make sure that your your liver is working especially with this thing called bile bile is made by your liver and it helps you extract fat cable nutrients from the food that you eat so what depletes bile going on a lowfat diet this is why if you hair dries out it doesn healthy there called Ideal Protein and they use soy protein isets which is like this modified soybean right and like a powder and they use other ingredients that are really really cheap so it a lowfat version of Keto because it low carb I have noticed in practice that when people do this diet they lose weight but they start to look kind of older they look dried out also if we look at the type of fat that you should be eating the saturated fats are very stable the unsaturated fats are very unstable and this is why when you buy these oil seed oils at the store and they from going rancid they so when you consume them in salad dressings mayonnaise basically it most of the foods at the grocery store so you really have to start reading the labels and if it says soy oil canola or cotton seed oil or safflower oil or sunflower seed oil I would avoid those and on your salad I would put real extraversion olive oil maybe some vinegarette now I do want to bring up this point on cholesterol cholesterol has a purpose and the purpose of cholesterol is to help make hormones also um the cholesterol is needed to make cell membranes so when someone is either on a Statin drug which blocks cholesterol or they saturated fat diet because they been told they have to replace their saturated fats with the unsaturated fats which is probably the biggest mistake in history because it problems especially obesity than anything else if you take a look at the graph of obesity over time sugar actually has gone down but the only thing that hasn oils it keeps going higher and higher and higher and so another good fat is the omega-3 fats from fish oils could be sardines salmon cod liver oil is a really good one that I like because it not only has the omega-3 it has the vitamin D and the vitamin A vitamin A is really really important vitamin A um supports all of your skin both externally and also inside your body one of the best sources of vitamin A is from egg yolk now you can also get an omega-3 or at least a precursor it from walnuts okay but I would recommend getting the sprouted walnuts or just buy walnuts soak them in water overnight then dry them out in the oven for a little bit and then consume them that way you don things that can create digestive issues and then you get um the sun okay the sun can make you look older especially if you allow the skin to burn if you are in the Sun and you just get a slight tan um and you don be okay and you age the skin what happens when you out in the sun as well and we need sun is that we also get uh over 50% of the rays are infrared infrared is very very therapeutic to your skin infrared can penetrate like two inches inside the body and it goes in the body and it can help increase melatonin and it just for sleep it antioxidant so when you your skin to Sun okay you don it it can overdo it I know as a teenager I I overdid it you know I let myself get burned so many times well that healthy you know that can really age your skin anyway right now you know the secret to looking youthful and younger so now your next step is to go out and apply what I just said if you have not seen my video on exactly what you should be eating I put that up right here check it out	Success
8 Ways Your Body Tells You Have a Disease	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	anytime you understand warning signs to predict what body before it happens is a very valuable thing there of my favorite books called the technology of War it Advanced knowledge so you can predict things now this book they about Advanced knowledge of an enemy coming so you have knowledge about if you want to go to battle with them or not but what I like to apply this to is your body having Advanced knowledge of what indicators of your body is so important the problem in healthcare is when you go to the doctor and you have these clues or symptoms whatever they treat them directly they don understand what you were to use these indicators differently to help understand what the body really needs so I through eight diseases and give you some of the warning signs that your body is trying to let you know there so you can do something and prevent this problem from occurring so let with the first one heart attack or cardiovascular disease so the warning signs for that are usually chest pain pain in your left jaw pain in your left shoulder or pain that goes down the left arm or maybe when you climb stairs or go anything up an incline you don right something feels off whether it you feel out of breath dizzy this could be the beginning of a heart attack and one really good test to get is called the CAC test this is a relatively quick test that can measure the calcification inside your arteries which is a really good predictor of whether you to have a heart attack or not one of the best things to take as a natural remedy is uh vitamin E in the form of tokat trinal another good remedy is vitamin K2 because that helps remove calcium in the arteries and of course radically change your diet all right all right number two stroke some of the early warning signs of a stroke or that you stroke could be anything on one side of your body being a problem let smile and the left side of your face just doesn both of your arms up and one arm doesn go up those are classic examples that you could be having a stroke another one is your speech is slurred so when you have a stroke there period of time where you can do something about it quickly and uh they can give you a certain medication that thins the blood to uh get rid of the clotting because the problem with a stroke is a lack of oxygen in a certain part of your brain is called epoxy and the longer that your brain goes without oxygen the more damage that can occur so the best thing to do is to go to the emergency room and get that checked out art number three an infection some of the early warning signs would be like a little tickle in your throat this irritating cough that won maybe uh it sneezing or you might have a running nose all of these can be indicators that your body is coming down with something the most important thing to do would be to take vitamin D3 in large amounts I talking about 50,000 IUS uh adding some zinc and vitamin C would also be helpful if you have any easia around that another good one and then also just to stay really hot and warm to the point where you generate a fever that can actually quickly kill it off versus what a lot of people do is they medication to suppress the fever which is the very thing that you overcome the virus in fact when people take aspirin to cut the fever down now the duration of the infection is longer all right number four fatty liver disease one of the warning signs for that would be like a full feeling or maybe even a tender or tightness underneath the right rib cage that some sometimes refers to the right shoulder this this trap this muscle right here or it could even go back into the romboid all of that is more liver gallbladder kind of swollen could be a fatty liver but one of the big indications of the fatty liver is that your stomach is protruding you have belly fat the extras spilling off into and around the organs in your midsection in the lower part of your body other symptoms of fatty liver could be itchy skin the solution for that is to go on a low carb healthy ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting and you avoid alcohol eating frequently like snacks and you may even want to take some choline which actually can help strip off fat from the liver all right number five gall stones some of the warning signs for a gall stone would be your urine is darker your stool floats your stool is light colored or you might have constipation all of those items that I I mentioned are a symptom of low bile salts bile salts are made by the liver stored in the gallbladder and when you don developing uh a super concentrated Crystal form of cholesterol if you had enough bile it would dissolve all that cholesterol but you don these cholesterol stones that are developing because you don bile so the solution for this is to add more bile salts and then do that for a period of time next disease I want to talk about is kidney stones one of the early warning signs of a kidney stone is a kind of a deep pain that is either on the left abdominal area or the right side or it could be in the back part called flank pain which is usually going to be like a a dull achy like pain on one side there this little tube between your kidney and then the bladder called the urer and a lot of times if the stone is uh stuck in there or right before that at the level of the kidney that can back up pressure and you can feel pain especially in the uh deeper part of your abdomen so if you have this what I would recommend is you start doing lemon juice like at least 2 ounces with water you can drink it down fresh lemon or just lemon juice because you need that citric acid to help it combined with the oxalates which are the most common uh Stone combine with that at least two half liters of fluid a day because that way you can prevent the super saturation from happening another really good thing to take would be magnesium I would take magnesium glycinate and I would also avoid foods high in oxalates okay that would be almonds and almond flour uh chocolate and spinach all right number seven an ulcer now what kind of early warning signs would be an ulcer well there signs but there are signs because most of the time there if you have an ulcer you have uh pain or burning pain in your stomach area you eat now if you eat and you get stomach pain usually that indigestion because you don enough stomach acid and the remedy for that would be Bane hydrochloride but if you have pain on an empty stomach and you have an ulcer if you added Bane hydrochloride which is an acid that going to make it worse which then you know it for that would be wheat grass juice powder with water and then drink that down as a chlorophyll healing agent another good remedy would be zinc carnosine whether you have an alcer in the stomach or the small intestine and then number eight diabetes okay what are some early warning signs of diabetes it meal without being really super hungry you may be hangry which is kind of a combination of hungry and angry irritated when you don you feel better or you around when you eat you may also crave carbs you may need a nap after you eat you may also have puffy eyelids you might have worsened vision and even start to have this urinary frequency thing where you start to urinate more and you blows my mind uh what the medical profession does for diabetes I mean they give you a medication to lower your blood sugar but they don diet you need to get off carbs you need to go low carb and you don eating all these snacks we want to do intermittent fasting and the healthy version of the ketogenic diet now I done a lot of videos on how to use various Clues to figure things out if you have not seen this video I think you it	Success
The Nutrient Deficiency That Makes You Short	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJa6F3fEy8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today I common micronutrient deficiency that can keep you on the short side personally growing up um I think my growth was stunted through wrestling I wrestled uh junior high school high school and I started college until I fractured my neck but for about three years I actually went through cycles of literally starving myself to make weight I think that growth and I say well you Dad is 6 foot no I so if you yourself you know especially three years in a row that can have an influence on your nutrition most stenog growth is related to malnutrition it is so important in the beginning years of life that you have all the essential nutrients I talking about vitamins minerals healthy fats because as because this relates to growth and development not just your height but organs and tissues if you deficient in iodine for example it can affect your cognitive function if you deficient in zinc you can definitely be shorter as well if you have some problem with your pituitary that affect your height because pituitary controls something called growth hormone but generally speaking girls generally have a growth Spirit between 10 years old and 14 and boys between 12 and 15 but if we take a look at growth we going to talk about all of the things we talk about vitamins and minerals and we start with hormones okay in a child growth hormone primarily helps you grow helps your bones grow helps your muscles grow helps your height then when you become an adult growth hormone has other functions it keeps and preserves protein on your body it you with weight loss and there things about growth hormone I want to talk about number one it amino acids protein if you consuming enough quality protein your growth hormone can be diminished if you have a high sugary diet if you have high blood glucose or you have insulin resistance if you don growth hormone is made by your pituitary goes to your liver and then your liver makes insulin like growth factor number one now this hormone if deficient can definitely make you shorter and this hormone is also triggered by a good amount of Amo acids and zinc you know how could you become deficient in zinc number one not consuming enough foods high in zinc and out of all the foods that are high in zinc we have red meat other animal Meats we have fish shellfish and there in plant Foods especially grains and especially corn especially cassava especially rice and if we just take a look at the country that has the highest zinc deficiency that would would be in Africa the Republic of Congo and I primarily talking about children and mothers now why would that be because if you look at their diet it composed of rice corn grains and cereals Okay now what of all of those it certain chemical that blocks zinc creating a a massive zinc deficiency which can affect the immune system okay what are some other things that can create a deficiency of Inc stress sugar eating junk food that was me now I also mentioned something related to Sugar insulin resistance most of the population has insulin resistance and that can create an effect on your growth as well because the insulin receptor has another function that goes beyond just the regulation of blood sugars it helps you absorb nutrients this is why when someone goes on the ketogenic diet and starts to repair this insulin resistance and now insulin becomes more sensitive sensitive they start having a healing effect with their muscles another important nutrient is vitamin D vitamin D is another really common deficiency uh simply because first of all kids don go outside much anymore it impossible to get from your diet all the junk food inhibits it and the inflammation in our guts block the absorption of vitamin D all of these things influence your growth hormone and your igf number one which is the insulin like growth factor so if you have a child that has St of growth grow I would definitely um Implement some of these strategies and there that I used in practice that seemed to work very well because your pituitary is at the heart and anything you can do to support the pituitary would be a good thing there is one product that standard process uh sold when I was in practice that seemed to really work it seemed to help children grow a lot more in a short period of time and it tropen PMG I would definitely recommend that maybe one before bed for maybe three months just to optimize the potential for a child we more to learn if you have not seen this very interesting video on zinc I put it up right here check it out	Success
The Early Signs of Colon Cancer You DON'T Want to Ignore	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCMN5UJzalo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let of colon cancer you absolutely do not want to ignore so when I give you these six warning signs just realize these are indicators they you indicators are symptoms that there is a situation but it doesn what it is unless you look at all the information but here the time there is no early warning signs so it is important not to ignore these signs but to understand them and and pay attention to them now I do want to mention pops little mini tumors that can grow in your uh colon and uh a lot of times people think that if you have Pops that means you have cancer no it could be a benign little tiny tumor that does not grow does not turn into cancer in fact 80% of the time there very tiny risk between 0% to 2% risk of getting cancer there are various risk factors that people talk about about you know like smoking and drinking and junk food and obesity and H pylori that microb that tends to live in the stomach but it can travel different places and then there processed meat that you may have heard of they always tend to talk about that there was a group that concluded that it data and the evidence is pretty weak especially since this new report came out in jamama which was a bigger evaluation of the data on red meat and processed meat and they found out if you actually include carbohydrates into the equation there no association between red meat or even processed meat and cancer and I to put that link down below I hope you read it because there massive push to make meet the villain when in fact um that may not be true there different types of red meat right you have grass fed grass-finished meat versus grain-fed meat did they evaluate those two no they lumped everything in together and their evidence was based on observational studies using questioners and they ignored a lot of the data into this evaluation and from my viewpoint my opinion uh I do not think that red meat puts people at risk for cancer now what about genetics well yeah there genetic component but it epigenetics your lifestyle are senior and what you do what you eat your environment can control your genes and then that leads us to this microbiome being out of balance 80% of your immune system is these microbes in your gut your immune system is what protects you against cancer I mean look at another thing antibiotics in one report it was like it increased your risk by 45% so anything that can alter your microbiome in a negative way can put you at risk so you want to look at what causes inflammation or a gut right what can that be well you have gluten you have certain foods seed oils all these things can create inflammation in your gut and then that can create a Cascade and create alteration in this microbiome but the microbiome can keep viruses in check so and I you eat food you two okay your own cells and your microbiome okay so what are the early warning signs that could potentially indicate colon cancer number one blood in the stool okay that if there your digestive tract by the time it gets out it be black number two anemia okay you anemic yet there anemic that could be a potential indicator number three the shape of the stool is thinner because there obviously some cancer obstructing the colon uh altering the shape of your stool number four you have constipation that seems to be getting worse why would that be because there in your colon number five abdominal pain why would you have that well because there your colon and it endings number six a sudden cause of weight loss or a loss of appetite so again these six indicators or Clues are just indicators that doesn have a problem and you you you don want to treat them as a problem you want to find out what you know the doctor comes in with authority and says you have this period of time to live and it people tend to live that particular time you everyone that and what do you do especially um based on um this particular person who should have been dead six years ago because he had a stage for 4 cancer and the prognosis of stage four cancer is like weeks to months he should have been dead six years ago he it did but we potentially avoid cancer okay what are some things you can do as far as antibiotics avoid those if you possibly can um and if you have to take antibiotics um definitely fortify with a good probiotic I think intermittent fasting and periodic prolong fasting is essential why because it clear out the colon you allow your colon to have a chance to regenerate heal and not be so stressed 24/7 I think the cruciferous vegetables would be something to look at and consume not every day but maybe a few times a week uh that would be like kale broccoli brussels sprouts cabbage now if I eat broccoli it tears my gut up so any of these cruciferous vegetables that you eat that you bloat don do cabbage and arugula very easily and then when you ferment it you get all this probiotic now remember when I talked about inactivity well activity as an exercise is probably one of the most potent things you can do to avoid cancer why because you mitochondria and all cancer originates from a dysfunctional mitochondria so by exercising you actually generate more mitochondria and you actually strengthen the mitochondria things like garlic thyme Sage different spices I think you should start putting those on your meat or your salad you want to avoid certain things that create inflammation like gluten and Grains and Seed oils and junk foods and also one point about inflammation is cancer tends to grow into areas of inflammation now I think there about the microbiome and if you have not seen this video right here I think you it	Success
The 15 Causes of ITCHING You've Never Heard About	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80	Dr. Eric Berg DC	So today we oh yeah oh yep mhm that a little to the left good A little to the right oh my gosh he handy today we the 15 deeper causes of itching that you probably have never heard about before so the medical name for itching is called pruritis okay and the remedy typically is just to scratch the itch right and it usually involves some superficial nerve that is within your skin that level you can have Lys on your body scabies which is a microorganism you could have hookworms herpes an insect bite like bed bugs you can even have a yeast infection different places in your body usually private parts or you can have poison ivy now I am deadly allergic to poison ivy and when I get it it spreads and boy does it itch like crazy and I have to resist the temptation to scratch it I found that going into a hot shower tends to be the only thing that can relieve the itching for 3 hours but I can definitely relate to poison ivy then you have a tick bite right usually tick bites initially kind of numb the area and you don think in the last year I had 20 different tick bites that I found on my body because I live in the countryside and some even had the bullseye and I never got lime so that sometimes you have to kind of check yourself because you don ticks are on your body but sometimes they do leave an itch and you can find out where they are and you can also itch from having diabetes Now why would a diabetic start itching because they have problems with circulation specifically blood flow to nerve endings so like even in the bottom of your feet you could have what where the blood flow to the nerves are not happening and so the nerves start dying off and so the sensation could be anywhere from an itching to a burning pain to an actual severe pain you can start losing circulation and this circulation is necessary for the nerves to function correctly there condition called polycythemia where you have too many red blood cells which can create a lack of circulation in your blood flow lowered oxygen into your actual skin itself and that causing the itching and even a problem with the parathyroid gland the parathyroid gland is four glands that are around your thyroid and they control calcium and if the thyroid is working too hard you could start developing too much calcium in the blood and then too much calcium that deposits in the skin and even create calcification of your skin and that can affect the nerve endings so there um Associated relationship between people that had severe itching and then they have their parathyroids removed and then itching goes away and then you have a problem with the kidney called ureia where you have this buildup of uh Ura in the skin and that of irritation on the nerves because someone has an advanced kidney disease then you have the liver okay and this is very common whether you have therosis of the liver or hepatitis when the liver which is supposed to make bile salts can you start developing this thicken sludge that comes down these little ducks into the gallbladder called colestasis and you underneath your right rib cage and maybe even pain that refers to your right shoulder blade and then you have also a condition where you have dry skin that can create itching probably because the gallbladder doesn be able to pull in vitamin A from the foods or you vitamin A or it could be also a lack of vitamin D which can increase inflammation and so when I was in practice there between people that have itching and people that have gallbladder issues or liver issues one would be just irritation on the gallbladder directly number two it can decrease your omega3 fatty acids because Omega 6 and omega-3 compete the average person has like 20 times more Omega 6 to omega3 the remedy is very simple you just need to change your diet and there cup it the bile and it significantly decrease itching in people with like sorosis so I will put that research down below as well now what interesting about uh the relief of scratching in itch is that you to stimulate serotonin and dopamine as the relief chemicals and there professional back scratchers that you can go get your back scratch and and pay someone to do that which is pretty wild because it wanted to increase your awareness on what on a chronic nature and give you a lot more information so you could potentially identify the real reason why you might have itching now since I did mention the gallbladder if you have not seen my videos on the gallbladder I put up a really good one right here you should check it out	Success
The #1 Nutrient Deficiency in High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlQyvXS6kLk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	boy if you have blood pressure problems you watched this video I about why people have hypertension the number one mineral deficiency behind this whole thing 90% of all hypertension is essential hypertension what does that mean it means unknown cause which is very convenient for a drug company who sells medications for blood pressure I mean in fact anti-hypertensive medication is right at the top of the list as far as most prescribed medications in the world first of all what what is hypertension what is blood pressure this top number which is systolic and the bottom number which is diastolic normally it should be 120 over 80 and what this number represents is the contraction of the heart muscle that pushes the blood throughout the whole body down to the little capillaries where it then goes through veins and eventually ends up into the lungs where it gets re oxygenated so the top number is the contraction of the heart and the bottom number is the relaxation of the heart muscle collectively together this systolic and diastolic is a heartbeat and when you have high blood pressure there it could be a blockage it could be a lot of things but the point is that when you have any type of blood pressure issue it puts more stress on the heart there lot of research in the relationship between a potassium deficiency personally I think a potassium deficiency is behind a good majority of this essential hypertension why do I say that well number one most people are deficient in potassium why are they deficient because it potassium since the requirements are so high out of all the nutrients potassium is the largest amount of nutrient that we need we need 4700 milligram and an average person does not get that much and the other interesting thing about medicine is that the whole focus is to reduce sodium for hypertension right but what about enhancing potassium didn about that what does lowering sodium do well it indirectly increases potassium we need about half the amount of sodium to potassium and I think these ratios are more important than the amounts many people are very heavy in the sodium very low in the potassium to the point where they to potassium but what does potassium actually do to your blood vessels and your heart number one it directly controls the tone of the vascular system which is the neurotransmitter for the autonomic nervous systems which is directly connected to a a high blood pressure situation because when you a hill you have adrenaline that kicks in to raise the blood pressure well potassium lowers adrenaline pottassium helps support the layer of the inside of the artery called the endothelial layer and potassium also helps improve insulin resistance it makes insulin more sensitive and what you go buy a potassium supplement usually comes like no more than 99 milligrams per tablet how many tablets would you have to take to achieve 4700 now there are electrolyte powders that have more than that the other consideration that people have about potassium is that oh potassium is bad for the kidneys that is completely false potassium is very very healthy to the kidney it when you have advanced kidney disease like stage four stage five that potassium can be dangerous now this next thing I interesting because if you look at the top medications for blood pressure they all retain pottassium interesting could it be that some of the positive effects of the these blood pressure lowering medications could be because of the potassium effect now where do we get our potassium from well you can get it from salads but you have to consume at least 7 to 10 cups to make a dent into this potassium requirement and the average person only consumes like a cup and a half and also these leafy greens contain magnesium too so the combination of both potassium and magnesium will greatly help the blood pressure there prehistoric Paleolithic times there estimations that we consumed like 11,000 to 15,000 milligrams of potassium now there it about what we used to eat way back in the day we pretty much ate whatever we could find if we could catch an animal we would eat it if we couldn animal I vegetation or anything laying on the ground like an acorn or anything but when we consume refined Foods especially refined sugar we lose potassium when we increase adrenaline or cortisol we lose pottassium so I have a challenge for you I would recommend that you start to beef up your potassium consumption through salad just try it for one week and see what happens to your blood pressure if you can then find a good electrolyte powder high in potassium I think you might be pleasantly surprised if all the amazing benefits now just to give you some visual on how much salad you should consume I put that in this video right here check it out	Success
The #1 Best Vitamin for Arthritis (NOT VITAMIN D)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWSfGrh-gus	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I best vitamin for arthritis and I talking about vitamin D vitamin D is great but there amazing I stumbled on this by accident I was taking this vitamin I never took it before go to sleep wake up and I just noticed like all this stiffness that would normally have because of all the injuries to my spine it to put WD40 in my joints I I feeling so loose so I that vitamin day before so with arthritis you have inflammation breakdown of the carage you have wear and tear you have pain people are taking nids to get rid of inflammation the problem is there bleeding ulcers kidney problems things like that if you take a steroid the side effect is it will lower your immune system so is there something that you could take that doesn the answer is yes specifically in the mitochondria and it this molecule called naad NAD is kind of a helper molecule for turning food into energy like ATP and so we about biochemistry here we about uh helping move these things called electrons which are really unusable until you package them into a certain energy form so that with and NAD is involved in over 400 different genes so it important molecule and I about first what happens when you deficient in NAD all right number one you repair number two you inflammation number three you because you make energy number four you have muscle pain muscle weak weakness and even loss of muscle number five you that could range anywhere from diabetes Alzheimer aging faster than you should because if you can age faster and then the next one is lowered immune system but aspirin targets something in your cells that helps make proteins and certain types fats well it just so happens that this vitamin that I similar thing to aspirin but without the side effects it helps to reduce the oxidative stress in the endoplasmic reticulum so that that right now which I all right so what is this vitamin called vitamin B3 ni acetamide there versions of B3 you have nin and you have netam nin is really really good for uh lipids and cholesterol and all that stuff nicomide works more on inflammation arthritis and many other things as well and so ni acetamide so here want to take smaller amounts of it through the day than higher amounts once a day so maybe you take 100 to 150 milligrams three to six times a day depending on how severe your are arthritis is so in other words taking a little bit more ndide through the day helps to allow your biochemistry to work a lot better despite having these genetic issues they polymorphisms okay a couple other things about this you have sufficient protein for it to work because you need protein right it the building block to help you repair the joint also make sure you drinking any alcohol I don you convert to B3 as well but the efficiency of that is not very efficient uh it takes like 60 times the units of tryptophan to turn into one unit of B3 a lot of times people are not getting that conversion despite all the problems in the diet especially if you consume a lot of corn that can block your um tryptophan and also if you junk foods and things like that you can definitely easily be deficient in vitamin B3 but I just wanted to give you the mechanism of how this ni camide works and I think out of all the things that I taken and I take other things like vitamin D and but this Nomine is just fascinating I recommending taking it right before bed at first you know you want to kind of gradually work into it maybe earlier in the day but there that just helps them sleep niten also helps to give you energy to exercise which is really cool but I wanted to just kind of focus in on this natural remedy for our arthritis that boy if you have arthritis it sure is nice to have something that is um non-toxic that effective and that is very low cost now if you wanted to know the number one anti-inflammatory food you should be eating you should probably check out this video right here	Success
Avoiding the Sun is Just as Dangerous as Cigarettes?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	what I probably going to reject it and click off before you do that just hear me out avoiding the sun may be just as dangerous as smoking cigarettes now I know you probably think I exaggerating but just hear me out there 17 different cancers and a vitamin D insufficiency and autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular disease vitamin D is intimately involved in over 2,000 different genes our immune system absolutely cannot work without vitamin D and check this out it impossible to get your required Vitamin D from your diet you between 5 to 10% and that consuming fatty fish organ Meats egg yolks which a lot of people don do that 90 to 95% of vitamin D comes from the Sun now check out these statistics there are over 5,000 deaths per year worldwide from too much sun but look at how many people die from a lack of sun 1,684 677 people every single year so there 329 times more people that are negatively affected by lack of Sun versus the actual exposure to Sun this is based on a fascinating book called embrace the Sun by Mark Sorenson who looked at and evaluated 1,300 different studies on the topic so they concluded that for every one person who dies from sun exposure there people who die of a lack of sun exposure I mean just think about the mainstream recommendation for Sun by The American Dermatology Association you must stay out of the Sun and if you sun use sun block because the sun is dangerous even in the early 1900s they had sanitariums that you can go to to bathe in the Sun as a cure for TB and asthma and many different illnesses well what about melanoma the deadly form of skin cancer in 1935 one out of, 1500 people developed melanoma in 2014 1 in 50 people develop melanoma and if we compare these two time periods in the past we got a lot more sun we were on the farm nowadays we 75% of all melanomas are located in areas where we don Sun it at risk for melanoma and I about being out in the sun and cooking yourself to the point where you burned you should never do that I talking talking about a moderate amount of Sun so you never burn but there something else the sun gives us for protection against cancer let me show you 70% of the sun is UV rays 39% is visible spectrum of light and 54% of all the sun potent stimulus of melatonin and 90 to 95% of all the Melatonin is is produced by this interaction between infrared and your skin and it increases the production of subcellular melatonin it the Melatonin it also enhances ATP so there mitochondria vitamin D and melatonin and both of them are triggered by the exposure to Sun I do know that there going to be people that will disagree because we thinking that sun all of a sudden is really bad for us but I hope you could at least take a different Viewpoint and just take a look at the information I put the references down below check it out I think your next step should be to start to get more sun exposure be outside more often and on that note if you have not seen my video on vitamin D you might want to watch it I put it up right here	Success
16 Signs That the Body Needs More Nutrients: Fixing the Deeper Cause	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I your body needs more nutrition now the problem is when I teach you this information you want to evaluate your friends and family and neighbors if you do that don mention my name sometimes it offends people if you don their nose or something like that so we you need to kind of know first of all why people are deficient it could be because you nutrient-dense Foods or you foods that are grown on soils that don have the right nutrition or even like grown in water like hydroponic you can also be deficient if you have genetic weaknesses or if you have low stomach acid and you can things like proteins and you can extract minerals or let example you don you have a gallbladder problem you not going to be able to absorb vitamin A d e and K all right here we go let Dive Right In number one brittle nails this usually means low protein and this is common in horses because a horse will keep eating until it gets enough protein and sometimes if there grass like in the spring they eating too much just because they trying to get enough protein in the process to get too many carbs and this is really common in humans we keep eating until we get enough protein and so if you example has no protein it down many bags of chips because we constantly are trying to fulfill this protein requirement all right number two blue Scara and what are iron deficient okay anemic the whites of your eyes are starting to turn blue okay and you transparent collagen which allows us to see the Venus part of your blood which is blue all right if you have pain in the tip of your scapula on the right side that means you are deficient in bile from the gallbladder and if you deficient in bio you gall stones all right the next one is tetany it kind of Twitches underneath the left eye or could be on the arm what that is is a magnesium deficiency magnesium regulates this amount of calcium and so now we don relaxation going on because the lack of magnesium accelerates the nerve impulses so you get this like this extra twitching thing that goes on in your body next one flaky scaly skin that is a classic omega-3 deficiency it also could mean you Omega 6 because they both compete as in too much soy oil or corn oil or Canola or cotton seed oil or safflower oil or sunflower oil instead you want to have more uh like fish oil especially like cod oil next one is high blood pressure the first deficiency that I would look at is a potassium deficiency pottassium supports the tone of the arteries it helps keep the arteries softened and it also helps reduce adrenaline and reduce the sympathetic nervous system that flight or fight mechanism that keeps your blood pressure high also potassium helps regulate the fluids especially balancing out sodium all right next one is excessive worry okay this is a classic B1 deficiency if you took some B1 you would feel really calm and you wouldn there worrying is going to be a lot less all right next one is hyperthyroidism the deficiency for this one is boron now if you were going to take Boron I would recommend you also take it with uh all of the trace minerals at the same time so that way you don Trace mineral because they all tend to work together but boron different things it like laundry detergent but boron important for your bone health it helps increase magnesium absorption and it can also reduce inflammation but it good for someone who has a hyper thyroid problem all right next one is hypothyroidism the key Trace mineral for this that something called selenium selenium allows the conversion from a T4 to to the T3 the active form of the thyroid hormone so when you think about Hashimoto think selenium next one is hip clicking or joint clicking if you getting this excessive clicking the deficiency in this situation is vitamin D3 now to fix it you have to increase your vitamin D3 to at least 20,000 iuse or more because one really interesting function of vitamin D3 is remodeling of the joint pretty wild eh all right next one is low testosterone this is a classic zinc deficiency zinc will increase testosterone the way you become deficient with zinc is eating too many grains Okay because of the phytic acid or too much refined sugar one of the best foods for zinc is red meat or shellfish or seafood all right next one is your hair is just taking way too long to grow what usually is manganese okay the trace mineral called manganese again anytime you take a trace mineral uh take it in a blend of all of the trace minerals next one is premature graying of your hair this is usually a vitamin B5 deficiency now vitamin B5 is good also for your adrenals and of course the more support you have with the adrenals the less stress but vitamin B5 also supports this enzyme called catalase which can then help clear out more of the hydrogen peroxide which can build up in the body next one is red gums this is a classic vitamin C deficiency it could also be that you because vitamin C and sugar compete and one of the foods that has the most vitamin C is raw sauerkraut next one is feeling weak this is a sodium deficiency you just need to consume more sea salt and last one is you okay this is a vitamin K1 deficiency now if you want to learn more about the different signs of nutritional deficiencies if you haven video it up right here	Success
#1 Vitamin Deficiency in ALL Autoimmune Conditions	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KUMT9PCwhs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I have a very important video today talking about autoimmune diseases and the most important vitamin deficiency related to this condition and answer a lot of important questions that people have first of all how do we know if we are we going to deal with the toxicity factor with vitamin D and so I have some really good solutions to all of the questions and the problems that come up with uh dealing with vitamin D in relationship to autoimmune diseases now if you coimbra protocol okay that was developed by a doctor in Brazil you need to put this on your radar because a lot of people are getting amazing results by using his high vitamin D protocol however there important that I you in relationship to this problem this is why he checks a hormone called the parathyroid hormone the parathyroid gland produces the parathyroid hormone which has everything to do with regulating your calcium if there calcium in the body parathyroid gland is going to rob calcium from your bone and put it into the blood now what does vitamin D have to do with it well vitamin D helps the absorption of calcium by a factor of 20x okay so it helps you absorb a lot of calcium in your bloodstream but you have something called vitamin D resistance that means that you can be taking vitamin D but it body so we really have to step away from just this calcium regulation because it controls a lot of different factors as far as this parathyroid hormone okay what it actually does it tells us if vitamin D is working biologically in your cells you can have normal amounts of vitamin D in your blood yet be very deficient in vitamin D and the parathyroid hormone will tell you if that sufficient amounts of vitamin D you going to have problems with calcium absorption and the pariy gland is going to have to overcompensate to overcome this vitamin D resistance and so we look at your vitamin D levels we look at the parathyroid hormone okay we want to look at the relationship between both of them because normally if you have high vitamin D you should have low parathyroid hormone or if you have low vitamin D in your blood you should have high parathyroid hormone it to know that the parathyroid hormone also helps in the conversion of the inactive vitamin D to the active vitamin D as it relates to your kidneys and the liver you resistance and one way to pick this up is by testing the par par thyroid hormone and really understanding what a high level means and what a low level means you of vitamin D because you check the blood but your parathyroid hormone is high suspect you have vitamin D resistance okay now how are we going to fix that well you vitamin D and this coimbra protocol has everything to do with adjusting your vitamin D increasing it to the point where your parathyroid hormone starts to come down to like a low Normal area and that means that you biological effect of vitamin D but the big question is what is up with this vitamin D resistance how do we develop it and what is it typically it has to do with the vitamin D receptor but it can also be in the lack of conversion from the inactive to the active vitamin D because there by the way is very very common the term for this genetic problem is called polymorphism I relation ship to vitamin D and every single one of them had at least one problem with a genetic issue with vitamin D and of course on top of everything else you also have a lot of other barriers of getting vitamin D right people don darker your skin uh the less vitamin D you the older you are the less you to absorb the more stress that you have the more vitamin D you and also the things that go along with it like the absorption of calcium this is why one of the side effects is osteoporosis and then of course you have where you live let North right where you don sun I mean just think about the fact that the closer you are to the Equator the less autoimmune diseases you have the more pollution you have in the environment in the sky the less vitamin D you this interesting topic of pathogens all will have strategic effects of downgrading your vitamin D receptor and your immune system doesn Vitamin D it needs to defend against these pathogens they then you get another pathogen which is the pathogen that comes from a tick bite do you realize that that microorganism will downgrade your vitamin D receptor by 60x all these people with Lyme disease they are so deficient in vitamin D then you get cancer cells especially of the colon and of your bone they also downgrade The receptors for vitamin D so they can survive there else I want to share with you it toxin from bacteria and you see this in like systemic infections you when someone detoxifies then you also have like other heavy metals that can also downgrade and make the vitamin D receptor less receptive now I hope this is as interesting to you as it is to me because I think it fascinating to understand the mechanism to understand there Vitamin D resistance and the way that we more vitamin D and the way we know that it this parathyroid hormone but let we want to protect ourselves against this calcium in the blood that high well there are several ways you can do it okay you can do with magnesium you can do it with zinc which are co-actors but the biggest protector of this excess calcium in the blood is vitamin K2 this is why I never recommend taking vitamin D without K2 now usually you would need about 100 micrograms of K2 for every 10,000 iuse of vitamin D and they were taking vitamin K2 in super high amounts seeing amazing results to overcome osteoporosis so instead of taking micrograms they weren micrograms of vitamin K2 they were taking 45 milligrams of vitamin K2 which is a lot more I your radar because let you have calcium in your arteries or you have a kidney stone or you have hypercalcemia or you have arthritis where you have too much calcium in the joints you might want to beef up your vitamin K2 to the levels of milligrams not micrograms and some of the information I on this amazing Kindle book that I just read twice okay because I couldn reading it this author has a very interesting way of writing that makes it easy to understand which I appreciate and I highly recommend you also check out that book I down below so thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video	Success
Best Nutrients to Remove Plaque from Arteries	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let remove plaque from your arteries when I talk about plaque I three things the combination of cholesterol a certain type of protein that creates the fibrosis and we about calcium these are the three ingredients to form a Band-Aid when you have inflammation or some type of problem in the inside of your artery the first thing to know is there of plaque there there plaque they the soft plaque is very unstable it more dangerous the hard plaque the more dense plaque the more stable the less dangerous the soft plaque is four times as common as the calcified plaque when you get a CAC test they give you a score and this score really represents how much plaque you have in your arteries mainly the calcifi plaque because a lot of the soft plaque is involved in the turning into calcified plaque that does not show up on a CAC score now there something called a CAC Paradox in which you might find that your CAC score goes up after changing your diet cleaning up the bad stuff and starting to get healthy the score might go up well what you plaque to hard plaque where it becomes more stable and there that you can do which I explain at the end that will help you identify more of the soft plaque because that CAC test really is not the best test to pick up this soft dangerous unstable plaque but I will talk about what tests you should do about this to assess this problem in a moment you usually have something called glycation connected to it what is glycation it where you have a sugar and a protein that gets stuck together and so that involved in a certain protein that kind of locks up and creates problems and inflammation in your body this soft plaque is usually involved with more oxidation okay especially of the LDL and I talking about the the one that pathogenic there there it that pathogenic type versus the other LDL which is very different it buoyant type and it type you just have to realize there two types I simple way to use what they give you on your blood test to determine what type of LDL you have the first one it long name myop peroxidase the next one is lp- pla 2 so those are the two biomarkers that help pick up if you have this soft plaque now another test that probably would be even better if you can do this and it inexpensive quick non-invasive test it an ultrasound of your kateed and that gives like a 98.6% prediction of having the problem there values to look at too is is your HDL okay you want that to go up hgl tends to clean up that pathogenic bad LDL the next thing you want to see on the low side is triglycerides because if the triglycerides are high then you can pretty much know the person too many carbs now there that if you can get this it good way of assessing what going on with these lipids okay and it called lipoprotein insulin resistance if you happen to get a blood test and you can request this it to know where your number is at because out of all of the factors that that cardiovascular athro sclerosis all right so now let out if they have the the small dense particles for the LDL versus the large buoyant okay without even doing that test what you do is you divide the LDL by something else called APO B it part of the Lipo protein that indicates the number of particles ideally we want it to be greater than 1.2 which will indicate large buoyant LDL which is the non-pathogenic version now all of that is very interesting and a bit complex so I want to jump into what nutrients can help remove this plaque okay well the first two nutrients are number one pyal that you helps convert the soft plaque to the calcified plaque where it becomes more stable and also it prevents the formation of plaque and the next one is called go to Cola you milligrams of go to Cola go toola helps enhance the function of pical so it going to help this conversion to more stable plaque it will also prevent the formation of plaque number three remedy is is vitamin K2 which is the most potent inhibitor of vascular calcification it basically stops the calcification from occurring in your arteries I would not recommend taking vitamin K2 in micrograms I would recommend taking it in milligrams and I that will give you the amounts in milligrams there personally don that and I don affiliations or associations with any other companies that do except I did find one company that does have it does provide it it called Mega K2 I below so the next remedy is nyise Nat kindness can help decrease the thickness of the kateed wall and the last remedy is called niin don release one get the one that creates the flush I know some people don but as far as cholesterol goes it is what you need now I that you take just a lot of nutrition I most poent I some other ones next that also create some amazing effects for plaing I just want to mention them because I don want to leave them out tokat trinal helps decrease inflammation of the arteries it berberine is a really good one you have also aged garlic you have magnesium and potassium that helps to soften up the arteries if they then you have vitamin D which is a very potent anti-inflammatory really good for the arteries really good as an anti- plaing vitamin and so I put a lot of the references that I talked about down below check them out but if You know the best meal or foods to help you avoid plaing I put that video up right here check it out	Success
Intermittent Fasting Doubles Your Risk of Dying from a Heart Attack	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMsItnMlhuo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I have some more bad news for you guys it reported on the news in New research finding intermittent fasting May pose risks to your heart the practice where people eat within an 8 Hour window or less researchers finding it poses a significant risk of dying from cardiovascular disease now this sucks because I have to now change 442 of my videos so I got my work cut out for me this weekend so just to be safe I I think what you should start doing is you should start eating at night snacking between your dinner and right before you go to bed and then soon as you wake up start eating because we have to save your heart now apparently this study is mainly focused on cardiovascular mortality but they did find that if you do fast for longer than 16 hours it does lower your risk for cancer so you need to choose do you want to lower your risk for heart attack cancer now of course I an abstract okay that means a short summary of an observational study it was based on a 24-hour dietary recall it based on having that person remember what they ate which I don what I ate two days ago and they mainly looked at this pattern of 16-hour fasting with an 8 Hour eating window now this was sponsored by the American Heart Association so we know it because they finding set to be presented at an American Heart Association conference but this is just another one of those studies where all you have to do is put a little doubt in the consumer and that question you know should I do it should I not is it going to be dangerous and going I die have a heart attack this is a tactic that the tobacco industry has used for many many years now what I found about the author Victor Wentz Zang from China I before which directly opposed red meat and eggs and cholesterol and of course all of these studies are also observational studies and so apparently lead studies were sponsored by the American Heart Association strategically focused research networks but the American Heart Association is the same Association that promotes healthy seed oils for your heart personally my viewpoint is they not very heart healthy but the reason they get away with it is because it does apparently lower cholesterol but that topic what I want to just kind of mention right now is four more credible studies that were peer-reviewed that talk about the benefits of intermittent fasting and supporting cardiovascular health so the first one was a single blinded randomized study and I to put all these Down Below in the description uh longterm effects of Tim restricted eating with resistance training right this was over 12 months significant decrease in body mass fat Mass decrease in inflammation increase in insulin sensitivity and also a more balanced lipid profile without adverse effects it was safe and effective for improving cardiovascular function number two this was a non-randomized control clinical trial for Tim restricted feeding on body composition in cardiovascular risk so they didn decrease in waste circumference and significant decrease in cardiovascular risk all right number three systematic review impact on intermittent fasting with cardi metabolic risk factors through four randomized control trials the results were intermittent fasting demonstrated significant reduction and body weight waist circumference body mass fat Mass blood pressure decreasing cholesterol triglycerides fasting insulin levels and Improvement in insulin resistance all right number four also evaluated this pattern of 16 and 8 16h Hour fasting and 8 Hour eating window this was on breast cancer survivors it was just for eight weeks but there was a significant decrease in cardiovascular risk there was decrease risk in visceral adapost tissue and so you know as much as I hate doing another video on something something ridiculous like this someone someone might have some doubt you don have to have any doubt this so-called study was completely ridiculous and you pretty much can ignore it and since we health if you have not seen this video you should really check it out I put it up right here	Success
Why Are There No Fat People in Colorado	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7M2oSGwfyU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I have a question why are there no overweight people in Colorado this video is going to solve that mystery and this is based on a very interesting book that presently it got an advanced copy by the time you watching this it released right now so I will put a link down below but today we dissect this mystery of why there fat people in Colorado so is it that they could it be the food they maybe they have more money for health foods and so this question puzzled the author for quite some time and so the first thing he did is he looked at the states where you had the most obesity and he isolated those and he found an interesting correlation between higher concentrations of black Americans Latinos and he also looked at the American Indian reservations and that all interesting but it gets even more interesting when you look at what is unique about that and there that the pigment on someone called melanin and melanin happens to be a natural sunblocker in other words the darker your skin the more protection you have against UV radiation now what does UV radiation have to do with obesity well UV radiation interacts with your skin and it makes vitamin D and it is true that if you look at the levels of vitamin D vitamin D levels are low in certain populations and so that interesting but is there any other data that aligns with this connection between vitamin D deficiency and obesity there relationship in fact and I put the paper down below and I don know if this is a recent discovery or it really saw it but vitamin D directly regulates the oxidation of the fat burning process in your adapost tissue and so vitamin D increases the expression of the release of fat from your fat cells vitamin D is also intimately involved in insulin in other words a vitamin D deficiency can be something that causes insulin resistance and if you have enough vitamin D it can greatly help you um in your sensitivity with insulin because insulin has a main function of fat storage and this also kind of correlates to in the winter months right when we don Sun we don have more fat storage and then in the spring and the summer uh people tend to lose more weight they come out of hibernation right could that be related to vitamin D well I think so women that are pregnant that are low in vitamin D these children later on in life when they become adults tend to be more overweight and on the obese side and then being overweight in general tends to dilute vitamin D in other words the more weight that you gain the more vitamin D you because a lot of this vitamin D is absorbed in the fat cells and so there a very strong link between vitamin D and your fat cell that I didn until reading this book I mean even look at the risk factor for metabolic syndrome okay there deficiency what is metabolic syndrome It you have high cholesterol you have high blood pressure you have abdominal fat every single one of those symptoms including insulin resistance relates to low vitamin D levels and this also could explain that when someone has high blood pressure and they take vitamin D their blood pressure tends to go lower all right getting back to the geography of United States if you take a look at uh the states that have more elderly people they are more overweight and we do know that the age of your skin has a lot to do with the absorption of vitamin D as well and so that of the puzzle that aligns to this idea if you look at the trends of obesity there in the United States that goes up roughly around 1980 and the author points out another interesting observation in the early 80s this is when the experts or science started to tell people to stay out of the sun to start using sunblock both of these actions will block your vitamin D I was born in 1965 through the 70s I was a kid and uh I did not observe a lot of overweight people in my school growing up and we were outside all day long we were not afraid of the sun yet we were consuming a massive amount of sugar and carbohydrates but I do know like in the more and more people that were overweight could it be this vitamin D connection well it just so happens that Colorado has the highest elevation of any state in United States so so this means you ultraviolet radiation and you to get a lot more vitamin D you to get way more exposure like three to five times more if you closer to the Sun than if even if you laying on the beach at sea level and so if you living in Colorado and you have this chronic exposure to more sun and more vitamin D it your expression of how you burn fat and I think the key word is chronic exposure right it exposed to the Sun or uh getting vitamin D and in relationship to uh what happens to the metabolism I mean just as another side note I had a patient in practice who had this huge belly and every time he went down to Florida and got a lot of sun he came back I swear it it was like it was flat and he didn diet by the way and he came back and I like wow that have the latitude the the further your way from the equator the less UV you going to get as well now what about in the Appalachian Mountains you have white people who don but they higher um rate of obesity and they the mountains now what about these people living in the Appalachian Mountains is they necessarily living on the peak they living in The Valleys it not as high and there shadowing of these mountains so they living in the shadows of the mountains which would not give them more vitamin D like even vitamin D and how it affects your sleep cycles if you vitamin D you don your sleep cycles are not going to be as great in fact if you have jet leg for example and you take vitamin D it of the best remedies it reset that circadian rhythm and then you have sleep apnea which is usually always a vitamin D the deficiency when you give people with sleep apnea vitamin D they they tend to not snore as much they tend to sleep better and then you have this connection between vitamin D and stress and cortisol cortisol stress in general lowers vitamin D but when you take vitamin D you can also help lower cortisol which is a stress hormone which can also make you gain weight and this cortisol stress hormone can also create insulin resistance right and so if someone is vitamin D deficient and they get more inflammation inflammation can directly cause insulin resistance as well which is behind obesity and then when you dive into the data of how Vitamin D affects your mitochondria if you don enough vitamin D you get a lot of oxidative stress the mitochondria doesn mitochondria is the energy Factory that is behind your metabolism so this is just one of many of the Mysteries that this author talks about so I put the link down below for the book if you wanted to check it out thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video	Success
Lyme Disease Blocks Vitamin D Absorption by 8000%	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJ7N_9UYK1Y	Dr. Eric Berg DC	there deficiency involved in Lyme disease that you absolutely need to know about and you can do all these regular conventional treatments and even alternative treatments but without this one nutrient you time recovering 100% And I show you a simple solution that you can do to overcome this the nutrient deficiency in Lime is vitamin D now the big question is why well that this Spyro in Lyme disease this very specific microbe has a very sneaky trick of blocking your ability to receive vitamin D in other words you can have normal vitamin D levels in your blood and be severely deficient of vitamin D deep in your tissues the way vitamin D actually works typically from sun the Sun hits your skin that then goes through several changes within your liver in your kidneys to eventually turn into the active form of vitamin D but it then has to be received by the vitamin D receptor which is deep inside your cells in the nucleus of the cell but the unique thing with this microorganism in line and what it does to your vitamin D receptor is it downgrades that receptor by 50 to 80 x the ability of your immune system to fight back is pretty much nullified so all all these remedies and antibiotics are going to try to kill it but your immune system is still weakened now I this problem but I really want you to understand why so many people with lime are suffering for years and years and years unnecessarily other microbes also do the same thing especially viruses like epin bar virus and even certain types of cancer also downgrade the receptor for vitamin D this is their dirty little trick to overcome the defenses of your own immune system it basically like being in this battle between you and another Army and having the ability to remove the weapons on the other side you know the problem is there you vitamin D receptor problem you really can to do a specialized vitamin D receptor test and I will put that link down below if you want a couple options so here you are you test becomes positive you check your vitamin D it really normal deep inside I mean just think about how many other conditions are related to a vitamin D deficiency autoimmune diseases cardiovascular diseases certain cognitive problems so there estimations up to 30% of the entire population has a problem with this vitamin D receptor but a huge portion of people that are overweight have resistance to vitamin D at the receptor level other microorganisms also have this nasty trick like chlamidia microplasmas so basically there hijacking occurring at your vitamin D receptor and it basically usually gets unnoticed because it blood test toxic mold asilis also can downgrade this vitamin D receptor when you get a blood test for vitamin D usually they test the inactive version for various reasons I going to get into but if you ever check your active version of vitamin D sometimes that just because the compensation of what your body is trying to do to push through and override this vitamin D receptor resistance and so if you ever get that blood test done and the doctor sees that your blood vitamin D levels are high what are they going to tell you make sure you don wherever you are in the stage of this lime disease vitamin D is going to be really important to turn this thing around but how are we going to override this resistance to vitamin D well I going to give you a bunch of things to do because the darker your skin is the more vitamin D you the less vitamin D you from the Sun the older they are the less absorption of vitamin D you can have the lower your cholesterol is or let for example you have liver problems or kidney problems or let your gallbladder removed or you Statin all of these are additional barriers to vitamin D so you need need certain things like zinc magnesium to allow vitamin D to work if you consuming seed oils that can block your absorption for vitamin D and of course if you issue how do we increase vitamin D well number one you start taking large amounts of vitamin D but I wouldn it every day if we want to get more penetration to override this resistance you want to take a lot of vitamin D like 50,000 and I use sporadically maybe once a week now of course being out in the sun are also important resveratol is another thing you can take to help increase the receptiveness of the vitamin D receptor intense exercise will also help the phytonutrient cortin can help as well and zinc and Boron and even progesterone and sulfurane are all compounds that help help override this problem but there actually can help you uh TKA is a type of B salt that also activates the vitamin D receptor I did some research on this and I was looking at all the alternative ways to kind of allow that vitamin D receptor to work better and bio salts came up which is fascinating now you know one of the most important nutrients involved in Lime that could potentially take your problem that you have right now and put them right straight into remission now there to learn about your immune system if you have not seen

#1 Selling Drug in the World: 27 Billion Dollars	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	we can learn a lot about the number one selling drug in the world now I going to tell people not to take this drug I take it and I get in the middle of you and your doctor with this medication but if I had this particular illness and needed this drug and I was told about this drug I would want some additional information and that want to share with you today this drug is projected to produce over 20 7 billion at the end of this year 2024 and it in that it in oncology because what it does is it actually uh targets a very specific thing for certain types of cancer not all of cancer it medicine so it antibiotic or like chemotherapy it very targeted to this one thing it releases the breaks on your own immune system cancer is always trying to evade your immune system this specific drug is called Kuda which does something to block that mechanism and allows your own immune system to be able to tag and see where the cancer cells are so they can kill it so that like about the strategy is that you getting your own immune system to do the work it forces to do a very specific job to attack a very specific Invader okay they also use this drug for autoimmune diseases infections and cancer you know I like this strategy better if you have the type of cancer that this can help you with versus chemotherapy which kills off cancer and your immune system it pretty much wipes everything out we dealing with something called immunomodulation okay this is something that either increases or decreases or blocks your immune system there are quite a few side effects as I all the different side effects there there its problems now the other problem with this drug is that it doesn types of cancer cancer is very diverse in other words there are certain cancers that don pathway for this to deal with and cancer has a superability to also adapt the cancer cells that are remaining from that insult they become resistant they become super strong and they can go out of control similar to taking an antibiotic these microbes uh resist that and then become stronger now you have these super bugs also this drug does not address the fuel for the cancer or it doesn needs to build cancer cells and the drug doesn environment where this cancer lives I think an approach that uses multiple strategies at the same time just would be really smart if you have cancer so the first question is is there anything natural that is in an immunomodulator and the answer is yes there are a lot of different natural remedies that help to increase or decrease the immune system in fact this is how a lot of drug compan get their ideas and develop patents for various research in the area of plant chemicals if I it derivatives of something that came from nature so we have a stralis okay that very potent we have the Rishi mushroom there too that deal with cancer and then of course you just have vitamin D in relationship to cancer and think about what vitamin D does as in an immunomodulator I mean I personally take 20,000 iuse of vitamin D3 every single day especially if someone an autoimmunity type problem or inflammation I would also address the diet I would do things to avoid fueling the cancer cell I would also do fasting because that is the most powerful thing to help starve off cancer and if you can fasting mimicking diet okay which is a bit easier and you would do that for 5 days once a month month maybe every 3 weeks and also there medicine doesn the mindset I personally know people who are very strong willed they down with cancer there when the doctor says you have this amount of time to live that there high correlation between the person only living that amount of time because somehow that gets in your mind and you agree with it and then all a sudden that happens but I think it important to disagree with cancer and basically say you know I survive no matter what I it happen there are also nutritional protocols to help starve cancer and if you have not seen my video that I recently did I cover all the protocols and what you need to do and I put that video right here check it out	Success
Fix Mitral Valve Prolapse with This One Mineral	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joYIVaukiVo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	if you have mitol valve prolapse syndrome today we the number one nutrient deficiency in this syndrome the first question is what is mitol valve prolapse well you have these valves in the heart they doors that open and shut and if they can close and open correctly the motor the pump is very efficient and you feel great everything mitro valve prolapse they floppy they kind of leak they large and they can bulge and this bulging is called prolapse okay prolapse is kind of a displaced tissue from the normal position so we have the valve in the wrong position it and from that you get a lot of inefficiency of this heart pumping action and this creates various symptoms like weakness fatigue palpitations anxiety shortness of breath and if you look this condition up a lot of times you ideopathic that basically means we don know what causes it and this condition is usually treated with either beta blockers or a calcium channel blocker now there research paper on this and so I to show you what I found I put those down in the description but from the American Journal of Cardiology okay there was a double blind study done and the title of this uh paper was clinical symptoms of mitol valve prolapse are related to hypo magnesia see now you can use that at a party to sound really really smart you can ask your friends have you ever been checked for hypomagnesemia just don name when you ask them that basically that means you have low magnesium in your blood and attenuated that means lessened by magnesium supplements they had 141 subjects and they compared it to 40 people who did not have this condition and the first thing they did is they tested both groups for a magnesium defici and they found in the group with mitral prolapse there was a 60% deficiency of magnesium now in the healthy group there were only 5% of these people had a magnesium deficiency and the results were this there was a significant decrease in anxiety weakness shortness of breath and palpitations and there was also a significant decrease in Adrenaline I don you have low magnesium adrenaline tends to go high now check this out this is interesting a magnesium deficiency accelerates the Aging of the fibroblast cell it basically the cell that helps you make collagen elastin and hyaluronic acid now all three of these things are like really important as we age for our skin for our our ligaments for our tendons for our valves well apparently this is kind of one theory of why we develop this mitro valve prolapse because of the magnesium deficiency and the fiber blast the formation of those little collagen elastic valves now if you actually watched my other video on magnesium the one where I talk about the first symptom of a magnesium deficiency is tetany like twitching like that maybe underneath the left eye it could be anywhere in the body if we just take a look at tetany in relationship to the heart this tetany is the heart valve prolapse and it symptoms like arhythmia because tetany is a problem with the muscle nerve connection well if you have that in the heart you can have an arhythmia and check this out 85% of people with mitol valve prolapse have tetany in other places in the body and if we come back to the medications that are used what does a beta blocker do it blocks adrenaline the very thing that deficiency when you take magnesium you don because you and it takes many years to become deficient and so if you take a look a like a lifelong deficiency of magnesium just by going to the regular rdas you probably not going to fix that problem magnesium is tightly regulated and so when you take magnesium it like it overnight it over a period of months and it could take even a year I I had someone reach out to me and they said you know I I have arrhythmias and I was taking the magnesium and I didn change I took it for a week I said did you realize how long it takes to fulfill a chronic lifelong magnesium deficiency it takes quite some time I would take 400 milligrams twice or even maybe three times a day and of course I would work up to it I would start off with 400 milligrams for several days then go up to 800 milligrams I would take one in the morning one in the afternoon and then take that for maybe a few weeks and then maybe even add a little bit more I would also and this is important make sure you have enough vitamin D magnesium won work without vitamin D very very important and as a minimum amount I would take 10,000 I use of vitamin D3 and of course I would make sure I avoid the things that deplete magnesium sugar refin carbohydrates like the breads the pasta the cereal the crackers the biscuits if we even take a look at what sugar does to magnesium if you were to eat sugar right now let you sugar molecule it would take 24 atoms of magnesium to help process and deal with one molecule of glucose and then if we get to fructose to metabolize one molecule of fructose you need 56 atoms of magnesium and also if you and boiling the food you could kind of you know wash away a lot of magnesium I mean in America there population that consumes ultr processed food so you know every single one of those people are severely deficient in magnesium the main takeaway from this video is this it takes years for a magnesium deficiency to show up and it also takes a year for the Magnesium to be corrected in the body and the type of magnesium I would recommend is called magnesium glycinate now there very popular video that

The #1 Vitamin Deficiency Behind Migraines (MUST KNOW)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UerbdBzb_6Y	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let deficiency in migraines if you had a migraine it can be debilitating it creates this hyper sensitivity of your smell your sound your sight so you want to stay in the dark it can increase the impulse to vomit or feel nauseous so apparently when I did this research I found something that I didn before the majority of these migraines are genetic and I do know from studying genetics this doesn to live with it it just means that you have to understand the epigenetic factors those things that are above your genetics that potentially could help you override this genetic weakness so when someone has a genetic problem they have a limited capacity for doing a certain thing but if you understand the epigenetics maybe you can override it and in 5 to 11 clinical trials there was significant Improvement in migraines now four of the trials were mixed and two of the trials didn probably because it wasn other cause to these migraines but migraines a lot of times will affect the ocular the eye and so if you do have a problem especially with one-sided eye problems I think this remedy is going to greatly help you there theories about you know migraines and no one really knows for sure but there huge relationship between your mitochondria and these headaches especially a Hyo underfunctioning mitochondria there mitochondria that doesn work correctly and this particular vitamin is involved with an enzyme that helps you preserve the aerobic metabolism in your mitochondria that just means with oxygen and so when you energy it using oxygen to help make energy and without without enough of this vitamin apparently what happens next is you get this OV excitation of the nervous system the brain it have this low mitochondria that accelerates the neuron itself and there inflammation oxidation which directly relates to the mitochondria because this vitamin also helps you build up glutathione which is kind of like a sponge so what is this vitamin it but normal amounts don apparently work you have to increase the amounts of B2 to override this resistance of B2 so you 400 milligrams per day but apparently if you have this genetic problem in your mitochondria uh you more B2 to make it work and what this vitamin is going to do it help this um hypoxic state or this state of low oxygen it preserve and allow this oxygen to work through the mitochondria and another little side note to this is um in Parkinson problem uh one of the earliest indications for Parkinson failure of the glutathione mechanism so apparently if you don have too much oxidative damage it can seriously create um damage to your neurons this is what I recommend and definitely put your comments down below if it helps you but start taking 400 mg of B2 just as a prevention and now let say for example you start getting a migraine what I would recommend is like instead of buying I don can buy 400 milligrams in one tablet you know get them in 100 milligrams wait an hour take another 100 milligrams wait an hour take another 100 milligrams and keep doing this until your migraine is gone but don day but the point is I wanted to put this very interesting connection between B2 uh and migraines on your radar so you can use that within your tools to help yourself one cause is basically a sodium deficiency so just taking more sea salt can reduce migraines and headaches pretty quick the other thing about these migraines is that there this oxidative stress for radical damage issue so just by taking some powerful herbal antioxidant you can many times get rid of the migraine as well whether it two that I recommend you can try either or now just from the standpoint of headaches in general I did a video on other potential causes that you need to know about as well and for that information check out this video right here	Success
Preventing Dental Plaque Formation Forever: Simple Solution	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WIiiUrV50M	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I way to remove Dental plaque from your teeth plaque is a bofilm of microbes what is bofilm it around a group of microbes and they build this calcium shell to protect themselves but plaque is one of the primary causes of gingivitis of bad breath as well as decay of your teeth and it because you your teeth you could brush your teeth and floss your teeth all day long and you can still get plaque and I to tell you why your mouth contains the second largest group of microbes in your entire body you have hundreds if not thousands of different types of species of microbes growing in your mouth the majority of these microbes are commensal it necessarily beneficial the derivation comes from the word which means eating at the same table now these microbes you can call them friendly microbes they actually do give us protection because here try to kill them um all of a sudden you end up with a yeast infection or a Candida infection even in your mouth well apparently those microbes are keeping the the candida in check they keep the fungus in check so if you kill them off now you have this overgrowth of fungus it microbes are supposed to be fairly neutral and not bother you plaque develops when this commensal friendly relationship changes to an unfriendly relationship called a pathogenic relationship and I don ever had this happen in your life where you had a friend that turned on you well this is the same situation these biofilms develop under stress okay what kind of stress well a lot of things can stress them out you eating the wrong Foods eating a lot of sugar uh smoking alcohol antibiotics I already mentioned that now is there any type of I don know chemicals that maybe mimic an antibiotic in your mouth the answer is yes the main chemical in mouthwash for example which is called chlorexidine and if you look at the side effects it increases acidity it increases the risk of Decay what about fluoride that all your toothpaste it Supply wow I did a little Deep dive on that check this out fluoride has been around for 60 years there ever been any randomized control studies on fluoride in the water supply the FDA recognizes fluoride as a drug if you look in the back of your toothpaste it do not ingest and the fluide that is in the water supply is not pharmaceutical grade like the stuff that you would get at the dental office no it fluoride in your water supply is a hazardous material from the phosphate fertilizer companies but what bizarre about this is like who the show on fluoride is it the American Dental Association no is it the FDA no is it the CDC nope is it the Environmental Protection Agency the answer is no so who is running the show on fluoride well it this is just another reason to get a water filter to specifically pull out fluorides from the water supply I have one in my house it fluoride filter I have one for chloride and I have one for fluoride because I don skin let alone going on my body and also as far as a toothpaste goes you know you might want to think twice about getting the fluoride in the toothpaste I would get a toothpaste without fluide or even just make your own so the dental plaque is coming from these pathogenic microbes they biofilms because there in your mouth that created a stress so obviously whatever that is based on the information you have now you can you know stop exposing these microbes to that but now how do you get those microbes back in your mouth yes you can buy a probiotic for your mouth absolutely but you can just start consuming foods that have probiotics okay sauerkraut kimchi Keir if you just start consuming some of those on a regular basis that can put the microbes back in your mouth and of course if you chewing gum make sure you do the xyle gum these new microbes will start to compete for food against the pathogens and so there going to put the links down below to show that taking probiotics can help not just um reduce chronic alosis but also reduce plaque on your teeth now if you want a good recipe to make your own toothpaste I put it up right here check it out	Success
The Big REGRET I Had in Practice	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so there have in practice that I wish I had the information that I had now back then because the advice I gave on this one topic was very bad advice I used to recommend 12200 milligrams of calcium to people especially postmenopausal women for bone health okay and especially if they had any type of osteopenia or osteoporosis I mean check this out if you have someone with osteopor rosis obviously they bone that osteoporotic person without exception also at the same time has excess calcium outside their bone in 15 independent clinical trials they found an increased risk 30% for heart attacks a 20% increase in Strokes just by taking an extra 500 100 Mig of calcium per day in another study involving 61,000 people over 19 years there was a pretty strong correlation between people taking over 1,400 mg of calcium per day and a 114% increase in dying from heart attacks you just go to the store and and look at the vitamin bottles right look at the one a days what ingredient calcium carbonate notice how heavy that bottle is because most of that product is calcium carbonate you basically eating rocks I mean when you think about how is that affecting the heart how is it affecting the tissues with all this calcium onethird of all adults in America over the age of 45 have some type of calcification in their arteries so this idea that if we just take calcium and bones is not true yes we have the calcium in the bone but also calcium has other functions especially all the different communication between the cells use calcium you have the intracellular calcium and you have the extracellular calcium outside in fact you have a lot more extracellular calcium you have a thousand to 10,000 times more extracellular calcium right here than inside your cell and so when this cell builds up too much intracellular calcium it commits suicide and check out this next Point calcium accumulation is an independent factor of risk of all cause mortality and check this out people that are taking calcium channel blockers normally you probably know they pressure but did you know that it creates other effects it can also help improve chronic diseases including you know ALS Parkinson Alzheimer from coronary artery spasm and Gina there calcium channel blockers decreases the risk of all cause mortality what does this tell you about calcium in our bodies but the point is that this drug has multiple effects that go beyond just blood pressure which is very interesting so since we osteoporosis or bone loss and what should you do instead of taking massive amounts of just calcium and trying to fix that if you ever look up the condition called scurvy which is an advanced vitamin C defici efficiency and you read all of the side effects of scurvy you to see one of them called bone resorption so in other words a severe vitamin C deficiency causes calcium to Lee out from your bone another symptom of scurvy is decreased synthesis of collagen synthesis means the production of something I mean think about what bone really is a lot of it protein and so if you don vitamin C you can another symptom of scurvy is something called Osteo liis what does that mean that means the destruction of bone another symptom is osteon necrosis that of your bone as I continue down the list of scurvy I also found osteopenia as well as osteoporosis I also found another side effect of oxid of stress AKA a lot of inflammation and the last side effect that I found which was very revealing is calcification outside the bone and so what would be the remedy for osteopenia or osteoporosis well one big thing that I would recommend is therapeutic doses of vitamin C and as I did a deep dive into this topic you to fix your osteoporosis or osteop just by normal amounts of vitamin C you not going to even create a dent into that problem you may need to use another type of vitamin C so you can use ascorbic acid or another one that might be good is magnesium ascorbate why because the Magnesium is really good to help lower the pathogenic calcification problem that we amounts that I would recommend of this vitamin C would be minimally 6,00 000 milligram per day now uh there of research on this not just for osteoporosis for other things but 6,000 plus so some people need to go a lot higher okay now I would recommend breaking it up into two or four doses and one way to determine if you taking too much is if you have diarrhea okay because that effects so you want to take a certain amount until maybe your stools are loose and then back off a little bit having enough vitamin C can suppress the cells that break down your bone and those cells are called osteoclasts and having enough vitamin C can help the absorption of calcium in your bone and this is that regret is when I used to recommend these calcium supplements I don that okay now you can get enough calcium just from a little bit of cheese but the point is if you have excess soft tissue calcium you don gallons of milk all day long definitely not the calcium supplements ant acids now I take your an acids but an acids a lot of times involve taking calcium and then you acid which helps you absorb calcium check with your doctor to see if you really need to take that an acid it may be contributing to your extracellular extra calcium problem that you have and don magnesium is a natural calcium channel blocker also vitamin K2 a K2 deficiency is the most reliable predictor of vascular calcification and of course if you dealing with osteopenia or osteoporosis a good trace mineral complex would be good so you get all the different trace minerals as well as consuming high quality protein in your diet like red meat very very healthy eggs are good but uh red meat is going to be the best protein to build bone now if you have that seen my video related to calcium milk and phosphorus I put that up right

Take One Teaspoon at Night to Rid Sinus Congestion	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNxeaMbzCb0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I remedy involving only one teaspoon every single day to get rid of your chronic sinus infection and it can be more of a Candida infection or a fungal infection called aspergillis which is the most common type of fungus that could be growing in the sinuses so if you have a runny nose or even a loss of smell or which can definitely affect your taste in fact 80% of your taste comes from your smell but the worst thing that people do to that aggravates this condition is that they take an antibiotic an antibiotic only kills bacteria and when you get rid of the bacteria you actually cause an overgrowth of this fungus so maybe it started out to be some type of bacterial infection but now it switched to a fungal infection that is very difficult to kill with the typical antibiotic and so people keep getting antibiotics over and over as this problem gets worse and worse they take the antihistamines they take these cortical steroids which get rid of inflammation but it makes it worse it kind of invades the back of the ustation tube into the inner ear and now they have inner ear infections and then there an invasive fungus and there non-invasive fungus the invasive fungus starts to break down the mucosal layer or lining on the inside of your sinus C cavities and it can start to erode the bone so it can actually penetrate right into different tissues around your skull from there it can evade the joints your bladder and create a UTI so there really important things you need to know about aspergillis it needs oxygen to grow it needs moisture to grow and it will definitely grow more if your immune system is compromised so if you diabetic if you have HIV it can really kind of come out and kick you when you reproduce this uh aspergillis and make it grow in a little petri dish if you feed it sugar or starch and this is where you see this fungus growing on like bread and potatoes rice things like that because it lives on sugar and starches which means that you probably need to change your diet and this also includes Dairy because there sugar in Dairy as well and they will just thrive on that so we get sugar refined carbs alcohol and even birth control pills can make it grow more aspir Gillis has a unique strategy of surviving by shutting down your immune system through downgrading your vitamin D levels so it goes into your receptors for vitamin D exactly where you know you utilize vitamin D and it downgrades them very sneaky to the point where you can get enough vitamin D and apparently it knows that vitamin D is essential for your immune system and if you can don important thing to know is that you need to take a lot of vitamin D okay 30,000 I use make sure you micrograms of vitamin K2 just to kind of keep the calcium normalized in your blood because vitamin K2 offsets the spiking calcium from the vitamin D what would be the key remedy to get rid of this fungal systemic problem number one garlic oil okay garlic oil greatly inhibits fungus yeast in mold not to mention bacteria as well you going to take five drops of garlic oil in a teaspoon you want to also get some oregano oil okay that anti fungal anti- candida anti- yeast okay five drops of oregano oil then make up the difference with coconut oil coconut oil has both lauric acid and caprylic acid both of those are antifungal and they strengthen your immune system and you teaspoon of this every single day over a period of about a month because it going to slowly get into your body and start to balance out the microorganisms you can also do other things too if you wanted to add Xylitol to this mixture you can do that curcumin is another one that you can always add and aloe vera is another thing you can add you can also do blue light wand if you have a blue light you can even take one of these wands there and and put it up your sinuses and for a few minutes a day and that can help the problem is I have not located one yet maybe you can search one and find one but blue light or violet light uh therapy would be really good for that condition if you had surgery on your sinosis okay and there mucosal layer you want to get the red light therapy uh sinus therapy and they have these little devices that you can put up into your sinosis and help this condition using the infrared light which is more of a a different Spectrum it not as much of a microb killer as it is a Healer of the mucous membranes and the Damage that occurred from the surgery however you might find that you start breathing a lot better because it can get rid of inflammation now there lot more to know about the sinuses if you have not seen my other video on sinus congestion check it out I put it up right here	Success
The Best Remedy for ADD/ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCc-EvGcUn0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	if you want the absolute best natural remedy for addadhd stay tuned this data is from Dr William Kaufman MD PhD I down below there is a very simple vitamin deficiency involved in this condition but you cannot fix this condition by taking the normal amounts of this vitamin you have to take higher amounts there vitamin you have nin and naside the one that you condition is niin amide you know one of the big challenges with uh using vitamin therapy is that um the research is usually using low doses of vitamins which are basically worthless and the other problem is that just the medical community is unaware of this not to mention the bad PR and vitamins you know they is absolutely not true and also like onethird of of 125 medical schools give you elective credits for nutrition like Cornell is like you get eight hours of nutritional information eight hours so check this out vitamin B3 what it can do for your brain first of all it precursor it very important thing in your cells that helps you extract energy from food it called NAD and so when you eat whether it carbohydrates this molecule helps to take these electrons from that food and put it into a battery called ATP so if you don can about this research with animals called increased running when you take B3 or what they call hyperkinesis which is hyperactivity could that affect your ability to hold your concentration on one without going into another the answer is yes you know you start one project and then you off to the next project without even finishing this project right here the actual power of a person is their ability to hold their attention on something that they they else with their mind at the same time which could be either dangerous or just non-efficient or nonproductive so vitamin B3 can greatly help your nerve cells uh get energy so you can actually hold your attention on something and not be so Restless or having to move every 5 seconds so B3 can help the hyperactivity and the focus at the same time there who have these conditions that um they sleep it this like nervous wound up feeling and I had this for many years and I didn know what it was when you become efficient in certain nutrients the brain and nervous system get hyp excited and then they kind of burn out but that really what happens so B3 is very very important for the neuron to calm it down to help it balance all the neurotransmitters and on top of that the most important thing is to give the neurons energy the version of B3 that you need to take is niacinamide now niacinamide is water soluble so it going to stay in the body for very long so what you want to do is you want to take 250 milligram six to eight times a day and this can work great for children and of course I come off your medication and uh you know check with your doctor with all that I just giving you some fascinating research that you need to be aware of and Implement if you want an alternative because there side effects if any at all the research on this has been ignored for 70 years okay so it about it and we spread the word and I going to put some more information about the doctor down below so you can study more about this but it fascinating but I recommend that you get on the right diet for this as well and uh because just by taking this vitamin it going to be the cure all it help you while you things as well and for that information you should watch this video right here	Success
The Worst Food for Your Teeth Is NOT SUGAR	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKZ3PV5mBGw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you know the worst food for your teeth is not sugar now it is true that sugar does increase bacteria that make more acids that can erode your teeth but there will severely erode your teeth and it doesn of course if we talk about fruit juice like apple juice or orange juice is five times worse than soda for your teeth yeah interesting and I explain why that is in just a minute diet soda compared to regular soda can you take a guess what teeth Believe It or Not diet soda might be worse and I that is as well number two candy the stuff that you suck on like a lollipop for example you your teeth to a lot of sugar and that could definitely create microbes that make more acid number three powdered starches starches can act just like a sugar and uh feed these microbes and create the acids and that would be like modified food starch or modified corn starch or molto DTR which is in pretty much most junk foods and then we just get liquid sugar as in high fructose corn syrup drinks right and I about the ones that you have added sugar in this case you just bathing the teeth in just pure sugar and just if we differentiate between natural sugars like if you eat fruit versus Dr drink the juice from fruit especially if it there five we get into actual sodas with phosphoric acid and believe it or not phosphoric acid is not the worst acid for your teeth there that phosphoric acid is not good it to leech the calcium out of your teeth so here you have a soda with not just liquid candy syrup like high fructose corn syrup but also the phosphoric acid but there which I six is like the gummy bears it sticks to your teeth so now we have the situation where we take the sugar and we stick it to the teeth and we keep the exposure uh there longer which is going to increase more bacterial fermentation and more acid and you also have the caramel too in different candies that are sticky but the gummy bears are at the top of the list now there people will talk about like acid reflux coming up and ending up on your teeth of course that I the worst for your teeth and I off of some of this sugar water right here let see if I could see this right here it says water sugar dextrose and citric acid that is the worst thing for your teeth citric acid now citric acid isn thing yeah it things like that but they also make it synthetically and apparently what unique about citric acid is that it very powerful key later for calcium if you saw my video on kidney stones you take lemon juice why because the citric acid binds with the calcium so it super strong keator which means to claw and bind okay into the mineral calcium so if you amounts you teeth and you out of the teeth and what is that the pH is not even that acid it this is like going Beyond just the acid problem and if you ever read a label on a juice bottle guess what they add in there citric acid what do they put in diet sodas citric acid and out of all the citrates it that labeled as sodium citrate so citrate is citric acid same thing and that is the worst acid for erosion of your teeth normally like um your pH should be slightly neutral or alkaline okay which is basically just slightly above seven if the pH gets down around 5.5 or less that the loss of minerals not just calcium you basically get demineralization of your teeth so what does this mean in Practical terms it means that if you consume anything you should probably take some water gargle with it and swish it in your mouth and spit it out just so you can clean your teeth of anything whether it think that would be a smart thing to do and also other acids I would highly recommend that you you know use the same process of washing your teeth out with water after you consume apple cider vinegar and of course start reading labels to make sure you so much citrate in these products now if you citrate or magnesium citrate that different situation that bound with a mineral and you going to leech out your teeth it to go into your digestive system and it anything that actually exposes the citrate to your teeth for any period of time you have to really watch out for now since we think it to have a good recipe to make your own toothpaste and if you want to check that out I put it up right here	Success
Warning: Missing Mineral Causing Arthritis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGD29BfITAk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today one missing Trace mineral in arthritis for arthritis a lot of people are taking vitamin D and they may not see the difference other people take a lot of magnesium for the joints and they also might not feel much difference unless they have this additional Trace mineral involved and that is boron now let me explain what Boron is it that we don but there arthritis I want to share with you Boron seems to be the key Trace mineral to allow calcium to work to allow magnesium to work if you you calcium magnesium in the urine you going to tend to get more calcification in the soft tissues you have the strong bones so Boron really helps keep the mineral inside the bone and allows vitamin D to be activated and help this whole process work Boron also prevents tooth decay like in tooth cavities if you don enough Boron you inflammation in the joints because Boron helps reduce something called C reactive protein you may even find that you getting receding gums kidney stones calcium in the arteries and calcium in the joint because you boron the tissue that contains or stores the most Boron is something called the parathyroid gland let me explain very simply what the parathyroid gland does it SE four small glands around your thyroid and what the parathyroid gland does is produces a hormone that helps control calcium so let you don don parathyroid hormone will increase to extract the calcium from your bone pull it out so you have have enough calcium so you can look at the parathyroid hormone as kind of like another vitamin D and what about the parathyroid hormone is you need this Boron to allow this whole thing to work even if your levels of vitamin D are normal in your blood you might have vitamin D resistance and this is where the parathyroid hormone starts going higher and higher and higher even know you because you have vitamin D resistance but it can also be you so I think a lot of people are deficient in boron because they really haven it on the radar as being something they need also if you going to have low amounts of testosterone you amounts of estrogen now when doing a deep dive into nutrition I always look at research on animals right because sometimes with humans the research is kind of like hidden andar bued but for Animals it I found something interesting with horses if a horse is deficient in Boron their heads start shaking because they have a problem with the trigeminal nerve that causes pain inflammation and they rid of it well magnesium in boron gets rid of it pretty quickly there data that Boron can help decrease the risk of prostate cancer as far as the amounts of boron to take I would recommend starting out with like 3 milligram three times a day and see if your problem is resolved after a period of 1 to 3 months now some people take a lot more uh Boron just so you know like some people take like 30 milligrams a day you have to realize that the toxicity level of boron is less than Salt and the heavy tilling of our soils have depleted a lot of these trace minerals including Boron so I just wanted to put Boron on your radar just so you know it does there about arthritis if you haven video right here go ahead and check it out	Success
The REAL Cause of Tremors (Alternative Solution)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I have something very interesting to share with you regarding Tremors I found something that of times tremors are misdiagnosed with Parkinson have to have Parkinson there essential tremor which is more Progressive into a bigger problem over time and that versus a resting Tremor which you you this Tremor going on and I found the author of this patent was a neurologist so obviously they knew something about Tremors and so I studied it and I found something fascinating I want to share with you if you take high doses of vitamin B2 and high doses of co-enzyme Q10 apparently you can improve this symptom greatly but in this document I could not find the mechanism of why that would help someone so that was just the start of my research in this area and I did a whole Deep dive into it and I found something even more interesting I found the mechanism of why these two nutrients would work and what amounts you would need to take to create a positive effect there correlation between mitochondrial diseases okay mitochondria is the energy factor of the body and movement disorders you see your nervous system requires a tremendous amount of energy so it requires very healthy mitochondria and when someone has neurodegenerative diseases or pathologies or anything related to that they dysfunction in the mitochondria and so the question is what does vitamin B2 and co-enzyme Q10 have to do with the mitochondria well a lot the mitochondria is all about turning food into energy ATP ATP is like a battery in the process of breaking down food into energy there is a compound like a carrier thing on the assembly line that extracts energy out of food it extracts electrons it helps carry electrons through this assembly line and so both co-enzyme Q10 and B2 are essential for the carrier of electrons the name of the carrier of this is called fad what about fad is like there people talking about fad but there are a lot of people talking about NAD you can even get that as a supplement and that helps the mitochondria work better it anti-aging it mitochondr it energy it people take NAD all the time and the precursor for that is vitamin B3 but this fad needs vitamin B2 and then if you look deeper into What vitamin B2 really does other than help the mitochondria work better it has everything to do with supporting fatty acids the membrane around the nervous system called the melin sheath and when people are grossly deficient in B2 they have all sorts of neurod degeneration problems they have neuropathologies they have swelling in the nervous system they start losing the milein sheath around the nervous system another condition is called Ms they can have exaggerated reflexes and they can also have dementia now if you heard of a B2 deficiency and like what it creates uh a lot of times people might associate like taking B2 for migraine headaches and stuff like that but anything neurological would be another reason to take it this B2 acts as a pre cursor to help protect the mitochondria that is why vitamin B2 is necessary to help correct Tremors now what about co-enzyme Q10 well co-enzyme Q10 does the same thing it helps to transport these electrons helps you build the battery it helps more energy in the mitochondria but when someone actually takes something like statins which is something that blocks cholesterol they deficient in co-enzyme Q10 and they going to have all sorts of neurologic IAL and muscular symptoms because of it so if someone is on a Statin boy they better take CO don side effects but what I did is I did a deep dive into all the side effects from Statin and take a while guess what other symptom I found from taking satins Tremors this is what I want you to try and then after you try this go ahead and comment down below and tell me how it worked out you amounts of vitamin B2 I would recommend you take about 800 milligram per day split it up into two portions 400 in the morning 400 before you go to sleep what about co-enzyme Q10 I recommend taking higher amounts of that as well you want 1,000 milligrams per day maybe take 500 in the morning 500 in the afternoon so go ahead and try that and comment down below and we also want to address the actual diet that may have set you up for deficiency in the first place and to know exactly what to eat to fortify your body with all the right nutrients I put that video right here check it out	Success
The ONE FOOD That Shrinks an Enlarged Prostate	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so there if you want to shrink in EN large prostate prostate is a gland that wraps around this little tube underneath your bladder and when it gets bigger normally it should be like a size of a walnut when it enlarges it kind of interferes with the urine flow and that can keep you up at night and enlarg prostate can also turn into a cancer situation and the name that they use for this enlar prostate is called benign prostatic hyperplasia what this is kind of what the theory is in order for the prostate to enlarge you have to have certain type of hormones that activate it okay and one is called testosterone because testosterone is a anabolic hormone that you know helps your muscles grow so testosterone through the help of a certain enzyme will convert into DHD which is a more powerful form of testosterone and apparently this DHT is involved in the enlargement of the prostate and so the mechanism of one of the top selling drugs for this condition inhibits that enzyme to reduce DHT as we age testosterone goes down DHT also goes down and also as men age the prostate enlarges so how can that be a solution since DHT is normally lower as we get older it words a apparently the real problem is that as we age that enzyme increases in its activity thereby giving you more DHT and creating a more profound effect over the prostate as far as the top medication which I mention they found that by taking the medication you can decrease the enlargement of your prostate by about 23% but there complications side effects decrease libido increase risk of prostate cancer as well as a syndrome that can occur when you stop taking the medication and that Syndrome has other side effects like signs of suicidal impulses atrophy of the penis and the development of breast tissue but other than that it totally fine the question is there a natural inhibitor of this enzyme the answer is yes in one study it showed that it can decrease the risk of an a prostate enlargement by 21% and prostate cancer this natural enzyme inhibitor also decreases inflammation it has a very potent antioxidant effect and the name of this compound is called lopine now lopine is called a carotenoid which is a kind of a category of a lot of different plant-based compounds and lopine is in watermelon it and it want to get a large amount of lopen you want to get it from Tomatoes if you can get them from your G Garden or the Farmers Market that would be great you can get them as canned tomatoes or tomato sauce or tomato paste because apparently the lopine and tomatoes becomes more bioavailable when you heat the Tomato of course don tomato sauce that has the sugar added get the one that as natural as possible now the other interesting thing about lopine is it which means that if you tomatoes you want add a little olive oil with it because the extra fat with heat will help extract more of that lopine from it if you just include maybe twice a week some type of tomato dish whether these tomatoes are on your salad or in some type of dish that would be a really great thing for your prostate so there are other things you can take to help your prostate zinc is at the top of the list ratol is another compound that they used with uh lopine now as a side note uh probably the worst thing for the prostate is milk because there uh growth hormones in milk that can enlarge the prostate as well and even when I was in practice I remember uh several older men coming in and and explaining that every time they consume some Dairy when they would wake up the next morning they had a a much worse time urinating probably because of the enlargement of the prostate so Dairy is something you would want to avoid now that you know the best food for the prostate the next thing you need to know is what to avoid there are four things things to avoid to prevent an enlarge prostate and I put that in this video right here check it out	Success
How to Dissolve Crystals in the Inner Ear and Get Rid of Vertigo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bpS3VVrKO0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so the big question is how can you dissolve those little crystals of calcium carbonate in the inner ear to get rid of vertigo that is a topic for today and I without using any medical tacnical terms to make it really simple the big problem with vertigo is yes you like you have this uh nauseous feeling feeling sick so it can be very devastating a lot of people have this condition and they go to the doctor and they might do surgery they might do exercises which are great but then the question is how do you get rid of these crystals so they don causing this vertigo in most cases is this little calcium crystal in the wrong part of the ear they and they communication between the hairs the nerves that go into the ear into your brain and this is going to affect your balance your ability to feel like you stable in face and so what is going on here it is totally normal to have these crystals in the ear but they should normally exist in another part of the ear and this is what I want to explain so in this first compartment of of the inner ear you have these calcium crystals on top of a membrane which is basically a layer of gel and under that you have these little tiny hairs that are then connected to nerves that go to your brain and so what is the purpose of these little weights they paper weights well the purpose is to add Mass to the gel and by adding mass or weight to this gel you to the hairs and that sensitivity is going to relate to gravity in position of the hairs and so your body has perfectly designed this uh interesting structure where you have this kind of gel with a kind of a paper weight on top to allow a mechanism to easily know where you are in space and you have about roughly about a thousand of these crystals per ear but what is when they kind of get dislodged and go further down the canal into another part of the ear where they these calcium crystals are floating through this lymph fluid and in a normal healthy person that lymph has a very low concentration of calcium and normally you should be able to reabsorb that calcium within 20 hours however there are reason reasons why this calcium might not dissolve very fast and that what I want to talk about now now number one you could have head trauma that can jar some of these little paper weights into the wrong part of the ear you can have an infection that does it there are also certain medications that can also cause this problem and then you have age just getting older can cause this problem because as you age you start losing these calcium crystals and end up in the middle ear however I found some additional information that will pretty much solve every single one of these conditions now they this and they found some interesting correlations between people that have vertigo those people have higher concentrations of calcium in the lymph so if you have higher concentrations you as fast if at all and there additional associations that I want to mention one big one is this higher association between people with osteoporosis and vertigo now what is up with that well we have one topic calcium when people have osteoporosis they have a lot of buildup in calcium in the soft tissues and people with vertigo also have a higher concentration of calcium in the lymph so what is the key nutrient that you need to take to reestablish this calcium that nutrient is vitamin D think about What vitamin D does in your small intestine it helps you absorb calcium by a factor of 20 TX and then I also found that people that have vertigo uh have a tendency to have low vitamin D levels in fact most of the population has low vitamin D levels especially as we age so this is what I minimally 10,000 I use but I would recommend 20,000 I use of vitamin D for this problem now I would also recommend always taking vitamin K2 with vitamin D3 but also I highly recommend making sure you always always take vitamin D with magnesium because vitamin D won without magnesium and magnesium also naturally counters calcium buildup but in the meantime you probably need to do these exercises to push the calcium from the canals into another part of the ear to prevent your vertigo and for that information watch this video right here	Success
This Is One of the WORST Things You Can Eat!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I one absolute worst food that you could consume for your liver especially if you fatty liver and hint it not carbs and this particular ingredient is not even high fructose corn syrup even though sugar starch and high fructose corn syrup is really bad for the liver there now the big problem with the liver is that there occur with the liver I had a liver problem for probably I don years I didn problem now I did have some symptoms but I didn symptoms were my right shoulder right through this trap right here and right back into on the back of the scapula and then also right underneath my right rib cage like right here was just always just completely you know painful sore tight and Bloated for years I didn that was of course this problem down here was my bile duct like the little tubes that connect to the gallbladder but that liver makes bile so I had this problem for a very long time and that a lot of videos in the liver because I completely reversed it and that big myth that I want to talk about cuz because people think that once you have a liver problem you always have a liver problem absolutely not the liver is so robust and so rugged it only organs that can completely 100% regenerate so that myth is that um the liver is filled with toxins it the liver detoxifies poisons it doesn cells store poisons the liver gets rid of the toxins once the liver gets to the point where it starts developing scar tissue and getting into therosis the risk of getting liver cancer goes way up the treatment that the medical profession has is not very good it just like you know liver transplant get on the list and there people that have healthy livers to give you you hopefully you the point where you can get a li then if you get a liver you have to take anti-rejection medication like prazone now you got to deal with those side effects The Simple Solution is you want to prevent a liver problem now there is a very interesting study on rats that I want to tell you and there the first group they fed lard and alcohol to these rats okay lard is pig fat second group they fed beef fat it called tallow and alcohol to these rats and then in the third group they fed them corn oil and alcohol now what interesting is the first group The lard and the alcohol had minimal damage to the livers and then this test were testing for like liver damage and then the development into a fatty liver because there was alcohol involved I kind of wish they would have added one more group with this tesp like a group of mice that only consumed alcohol just to see what would happen but anyway the first group that had pig fat lard and alcohol they had minimal damage to the liver the next group with the taow beef fat in alcohol they had virtually no damage to the liver what does that mean that means that beef fat could potentially be protective to the liver what one idea that actually fascinating especially since I consume a lot of beef fat in my diet and I don problems anymore but then the Third group of rats that were fed corn oil and alcohol guess what happened to them not good severe liver damage is the most damage of all three groups the worst food or ingredient will call it for a fatty liver or a liver in general is seed oils seed oils are very inflammatory they especially the way that they processed right here you can see see this right here now what about this seed oil right here you see these pictures of the vegetable oils because that vegetable oil to me that advertising because you vegetables on there thinking that that oil is coming from vegetables when it not this is like soy oil I mean I think just a matter of time before these guys get in trouble with advertising because it type of fat that that were getting way too much like an average person in the US gets between 25 to 30% of their calories it linolic acid and so lard pig fat has about 2.5% of it linolic acid taow beef fat only has 7% linolic acid that less than 1% but corn oil has like 56.6% lenic acid so it linolic acid in the seed oils that are oxidized or damaged to the point where it can create a lot of free radical damage and like a rusting out effect on your cells especially in the liver the nervous system and then from that you get a lot of byproducts I mean I several videos on this topic if you haven out but you want to get these oils out of your diet big time our diet diet is composed of way too much of it 25 to 30% of it uh it also gets lodged and stuck in our cells and our fat cells in the membranes around our nervous system for two to three years yeah so when you eat sugar for example you fast but when you consume something like this it gets lodged in the bond and gets stuck in there we can energy so what are we using it as well cell membranes hormones I mean it our tissues and creating all sorts of inflammation and especially inflammation in the liver which then leads to insulin resistance and you should just start reading the ingredients on things and when you go to restaurants right just ask what type of oil are you frying my food in I I would avoid anything fried at any fast food restaurant or any restaurant I wouldn because you soy oil the corn oil maybe canola or cotton seed oil you want to avoid that for at least you know two to three years to get it out of the system create a demonstration on yourself how good you could feel if you actually were to replace that crappy uh oil with something healthier you want to start replacing with omega3 fatty acids that would be like the fish oils the collor oil things like that that oil is anti-inflammatory they this severely damaged oxidative oil but they over up to 100 or more times I mean can you imagine the amount of byproducts that are given off and the amount of oxidative stress that your cells so number one remove the seed oils from the diet start reading ingredients number two start adding in more omega-3 fatty acids number three start decreasing the amount of animal foods like chicken turkey you know even beef that are grain fed and even eggs are fed grains unless you can find a an egg that is higher in omega-3 fatty acids the point is that you want to start cutting down these seed oils and high omega-6 fats from your diet and replace this with grass-fed grassfish beef grass-fed lamb grass fed goat grass-fed Buffalo things like that and I also don would hurt if you also added cruciferous vegetables in there like cabbage sauerkraut things like that because that now that you know the number one worst food for the liver let foods are really good for the liver and for that information I put this video up right here check it out	Success
What Chemotherapy Does to Your Body	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgAUSAz9Pl0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let effects of chemotherapy here chemotherapy it creates a Toxic effect the entire body the other problem with chemotherapy is that yes it kills cancer but it never kills 100% there small amount left the cancer cells that are not killed actually become stronger so this is like the biggest problem with oncologists dealing with the resistance after the first round of chemotherapy the cancer comes back with a vengeance so you need stronger chemotherapy you need additional drugs because now the cancer is very resistant last year 20 million people worldwide got cancer 9.7 million of them died the most common cancer is lung cancer followed by color rectal cancer so whether you have cancer or not you may end up having a friend or loved one that has cancer and you can share this information certain phytonutrients have protective effects against cancer so I evaluated a lot of them and I put the links down below but there are five that I wanted to bring up and talk about because these five they have chemo preventative factors okay that little bit different than chemo protective factors chemo preventative factors actually do things to prevent cancer from happening in the first place and prevent needing chemotherapy so when that pathway gets triggered or those genes you are protected from oxidative stress inflammation free radical damage you get better detoxification and all five of the phytonutrients I mention have that effect as well so what are they number one sulfur of Fame that also do adult broccoli but when you do the broccoli Sprouts it times more concentrated and it another cruciferous vegetables as well number two Resveratrol now that common phytonutrient that helps anti-aging as well but it potent um phytonutrient that you can take if you one on the list is coratin okay that in onions it then we get to the major compound in green tea e g CG and then the last one on the list is called Allison in garlic now there other things you can do too which I going to get into next one is ketsia what is that that is the wasting away a body tissue from certain diseases like cancer well what this is that over 50% of the people who have cancer die of this ketsia not the cancer directly and this problem can be greatly improved by taking magnesium there magnes magnesium deficiency and ketsia so by taking magnesium you can help uh prevent or maybe even slow down this process and now I something even more interesting and this is a a trace mineral called selenium now I recently learned about selenium in a whole different light from this book right here what really causes AIDS by Herold d foster wow fascinating book I talk about AIDS but I want to talk about the relationship between selenium in the immune system so what does AIDS stand for acquired immuno deficiency syndrome you specific in your immune system the te- helper cell if you don this the t- helper cell is like the general of an army the t- helper cell coordinates and manages the defense mechanism all the different immune cells and what they should do and what they shouldn dependent on selenium now what interesting is that they found a direct correlation between a deficiency of these t- helper cells and AIDS but even more of an association with AIDS is the deficiency in selenium if you make this general of your army it it just like it nonfunctional and they also uh found some fascinating data in areas of Africa where they have the highest rate of AIDS they have the most deficient soils in selenium the same thing in the US as well areas of the country that are most efficient selenium as far as the soils go have the highest rate of AIDS now there another video but I want to mention two other immune cells that are dependent on selenium one is the natural killer cell the other one is the cytotoxic cell with both of these have two jobs to kill viruses and to kill cancer they are both dependent on selenium so if I had AIDS I would be taking 400 micrograms of selenium every single day if I had cancer I would want to strengthen my immune system and I would take at least 200 to 400 micrograms of selenium now why would I take that because the chemo is destroying my immune system that is one big problem it may not lessen the side effects but it may strengthen your defenses against cancer all right so I talked about the five phytonutrients I talked about mag magnesium selenium what else is there intermittent fasting and prolong fasting I on this topic when you do intermittent fasting and especially prolonged fasting you strengthen your immune system there topic but I another video too I below you can watch that later next thing exercise exercise can greatly reduce the side effects from chemo now why would that help well because exercise directly and powerfully strengthens your mitochondria cancer is a mitochondrial disease so you must exercise on a regular basis not just if you have cancer on chemo but just to prevent cancer as well next thing cold therapy cold therapy can also reduce the side effects from chemo and radiation therapy interesting next thing vitamin D vitamin D is one of the most important vitamins to strengthen the immune system if you had cancer how much vitamin D should you take well you should take a lot you should take high doses of it if you look at the normal amounts that most doctors want your vitamin D at it between 30 and 100 nanograms per milliliter of blood you might want to increase that even more at least 120 nog per milliliter now some people are going to say well isn from vitamin D I actually don there is I think it deficiency more than a vitamin D toxicity for more information on that topic you should check out this video right here	Success
Is This Why YouÂre Stressed or Not Sleeping?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQffcNyo2w	Dr. Eric Berg DC	did you realize that it difficult to reverse a magnesium deficiency but I to do it in this video so my question is how long does it take to solve a problem that you solution and the answer is you solve the problem if you use the wrong solution most people don common a magnesium deficiency is there been some reports that up to 88% of the general public are low in magnes magesium and what than that is that it test for a magnesium deficiency there no gold standard you can do a questioner and there actually extract some tissue from the inside of your mouth and then send it to the lab but the problem with that test and the reason I is because I can that does this very specific specialize test so I link because they you back so in this little chart you can see that 60% of all your magnesium is in your bones 39% is in your soft tissues like your muscles but only 1% of all the magnesium in your body is in your blood so this is why doing a blood test is not going to give you a lot of information unless you because even if you blood guess what you the bone or the soft tissues and in the bone and the soft tissues most of that is not out outside the cell it your cells it calcium and so one of the principles that I use in health is I I use a principle out of this book called the technology of War by sunu now of course this book is about fighting Wars but you can apply it to anything and so senu talks about cross referencing data to see if a situation or a problem exists where you can cross reference symptoms that are related to a magnesium deficiency you can also look at your foods to see how much magnesium is coming from your Foods or not if you have inflammation in your gut if you diabetic if you have insulin resistance if you consume a lot of sugar also if you take a lot of vitamin D the requirement for magnesium goes up so if you D you can actually end up having lower amounts of magnesium because your body is using more of that magnesium for vitamin D absorption and also if you on medications let an an acid or you antibiotic or you these factors when cross reference can kind of indicate you might have a magnesium deficiency but now let reference this with a potential indicators or symptoms you might have if you have a little twitch underneath your left eye are your muscles relaxed or are they tight do you have insomnia do you have a lot of anxiety do you have fatigue did you realize that you need magnesium just to make ATP the energy currency of your body also a magnesium deficiency can create you know things like NES stigmus which is like when your eyes kind of go back and forth like that and migraines and kidney stones and especially something called pathogenic calcification what is that that is calcification that buildup in places that you should have it so I list of foods that are fairly high in magnesium compared to other Foods okay and we quantity of 100 gr okay that half ounces so at the top of the list you have calp 3 and half ounces of calp is equivalent to 760 milligrams now I like to see you eat 3 and half ounces of calp it okay what about almonds that would give you about 490 mg nutritional yeast is 231 mg PE 142 mg leafy greens roughly about 100 mg of magnesium dark chocolate is about 165 Mig pumpkin seeds are 265 mg of magnesium but magnesium is also in meats and fish but not as much as you might think so 100 gram or 3 and half ounces of meat or fish you between 25 to 35 mg of magnesium and even if we look at the requirements of magnesium it usually is between 300 and 420 milligram per day on average but the average person only consumes 25 milligrams of magnesium per day people aren diet not to mention the foods nowadays are grown in soil that has lower amounts of minerals especially magnesium and it three situations number one how do we get enough magnesium from the do we have to supplement and three how long does it take to really satisfy your deficiency oh and by the way all the information I book right here called The Miraculous cure for and prevention of all diseases what doctors never learned I link down below it fascinating book based on a lot of different things related to magnesium and vitamin D but all the data that I sharing today is based in that book so if you to not only beef up no pun intended your magnesium foods but you have to supplement as well and the type of magnesium I would recommend is magnesium glycinate which actually helps you know stress sleeping Etc and the amount of supplement I would recommend would be about 800 milligrams every single day so usually they come in like 400ish maybe 300 milligrams per tablet take a couple of those every day but here here actually going to take to really fix a true deficiency it could take up to a year or more to fix a chronic magnesium deficiency you have to realize that when you take magnesium from Foods or a supplement it doesn a good majority of it will be washed out through the kidneys but you might find your symptoms go away within weeks or months but I wouldn increase the amount out over a longer period of time then maybe after about a year of taking supplements then maybe then you just maintain it with your diet but of course make sure that you calculate how much magnesium is going into the body and then make sure at least it now I have a little more information on the type of magnesium that might work for you and for that information I put that in this video right here check it

How To RESTORE Hearing Loss FAST!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC7b3EfnmSw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we resolve hearing loss with nutrients and of course when you do research on this topic you that keeps popping up over and over and over as the cause of hearing loss and that is it mean it means we don types of General hearing loss you have the congenital which doesn mean it that your mother had an infection when she was caring you and that created hearing or it could have been an iodine deficiency that she had or alcohol alcohol can severely affect the hearing and many other things involved with the nerves but also viruses can do it as well cyto megala viruses herpes viruses so that is congenital okay then you have acquired hearing loss you might see this term age related hearing loss but there than hearing aids so the two main things that I see that are affecting hearing are a group of viruses and also nutritional deficiencies so when you go through an acute infection there initial dramatic decrease in zinc and iron both of these are related to a loss of hearing and this is why after a chronic infection people start developing like ulcers inside the mouth that is a zinc deficiency a loss of taste or smell that deficiency or they start craving things weird like dirt ice charcoal all of those could be an iron deficiency now viruses can also create other deficiencies too like a selenium deficiency but selenium is fascinating because it helping convert from T4 to T3 the active form of the thyroid hormone it key in helping the t- helper cell work and that is the cell that helps coordinate the entire immune system so selenium is important in inflammatory conditions as well as autoimmune conditions especially if it the thyroid as in hashimotos there are a lot of viruses involved in hearing loss you have measles which by the way can deplete you of vitamin A you have shingles it was the chickenpox when you were a kid so it is important to kind of look in your past to see when your hearing loss started and what happened right before that did you get some re occurrence of a virus that was in remission then we have the sensory nerves that are involved in the ear that can become damaged having diabetes that neuropathy this involves a severe B1 deficiency B1 is like the key nutrient to help your autonomic nervous system and if you automatically going to be deficient in vitamin B1 so if you have all the sugar going through your bloodstream stream it metabolize that and it could affect the inner ear so B1 is another really key nutrient to help hearing but if you going to take B1 especially if it related to diabetes I would recommend taking something called botam that can actually penetrate into the myin sheath into the nerve so then we get into Vitamin D first of all you have all of the autoimmune diseases that relate to hearing loss you have autoimmune inner ear disease you have Lupus and ritro arthritis but the antidote to all of those is vitamin D in higher doses there low vitamin D and vertigo which is also related to the air and on top of that viruses can really lower your ability to absorb vitamin D at the receptor level so even though you taking the regular amounts you might not be getting it in the receptor because that virus is downgrading the receptor and I all these vitamins I Clues to look at your life to see if you could potentially connect the dots between some deficiency that you might have and you know that you have three little tiny fragile bones in the inner ear and if they not working correctly you can start experiencing hearing loss and so selenium protects you against loud sounds because it oxidative stress and the same thing with iron and zinc one little point about uh selenium this is a very powerful molecule to protect you against oxidative damage and hydrogen peroxide buildup now hydrogen peroxide uh can even trigger an autoimmune disease and so this is why people with Vitiligo and inflammatory conditions should be taking selenium but here to hear you need to have high amounts of pottassium and if you don potassium you won the last thing I want to talk about is elderone it your adrenal glands that helps you regulate potassium and it blood pressure control as well now why would elderone helps someone because as we age elderone goes down but also potassium goes down too now just to learn more about potassium if you have not seen my video on potassium you should probably check it out I up right here	Success
YOUR BODY IS TRYING TO WARN YOU!!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	there are five critical warning signs that you should never ignore a lot of people have one of these five symptoms and they here to tell you that you don ignore these five signs because you can usually do something about it if you catch it in time far too often when you go to the doctor they just basically treat your symptom what high blood pressure could be this or that here just take this medication high cholesterol take this medication arthritis take this medication I am more interested to find the underlying root cause so I don the rest of my life so let number one chronic fatigue you could be fatigued chronically from so many things if you have anemia that could be either low B12 or iron I was chronically fatigued for many many years and I was taking tons and tons of vitamins thinking that driving down the street with my wife and say honey honey let there in this like health food store and I be asking them maybe I need this vitamin or that vitamin I that the vitamins will not work for various symptoms unless you correct the diet there recommend that will handle a lot of problems to the point where you might not need any vitamins at all it wasn until I started having protein for breakfast that I really had this realization that wow that that I needed that just totally woke me up another cause of of chronic fatigue is low vitamin B1 if you B1 you of the Mind thinking about problems before you go to bed Restless like syndrome you nervous energy chronic fatigue could come from a tick bite this microorganism in these ticks they downgrade your vitamin D receptors very sneaky leaving you with the inability to use vitamin D3 if you have a liver disease heart disease autoimmune disease that involving a lot of inflammation and then let example you and nothing is working there is a small rare chance that it could be something more serious possibly cancer probably not but you can always get an assessment to rule that out number two sudden weight loss it could be any number of things it could be hyperthyroidism and that can actually speed up the thyroid and cause you to lose weight also type 1 diabetes can cause weight loss a disease with your adrenal glands where they of shutting down called Addison disease also could cause you to lose weight parasites can cause you to lose weight number three persistent weakness this could be Iron you could be anemic it could also be as simple as not having enough sodium low sodium will cause weakness but you can also be weak if you and then pottassium deficiency can also make you weak number four chronic diarrhea mostly uh diarrhea comes from food poisoning or eating something that your body disagreed with it could also be low zinc one of the symptoms is diarrhea I think a common reason for a lot of diarrhea is side effect for medication so you want to look at that as well and a lot of people have irritable bowel syndrome and they doing a lot of grains and the grains are just Terri up their colon they getting diarrhea from that but I think a big one especially if you travel overseas somewhere getting a parasite that can create diarrhea in which case when you get back you need to take a probiotic a strong one for a long time to fix that problem and then number five is persistent stomach or abdomen pain I would start eating better and then get rid of the junk food okay that should handle 95% of the problem right there if it doesn could be coming from a gall stone or a kidney stone and you won tell the difference unless they do an ultrasound or some other test and so a kidney stone too is not always felt in the back part it could be felt in the front as well there called small intestinal bacteria overgrowth where the microbes are in the small intestine not the large the solution is to do intermittent fasting garlic and some ban hydroch chloride but this is all generated from being very very sick with the abdomen you could have like appendicitis you could have a parasite I mean it could be cancer rare it could be an ulcer or gallbladder sludge which is actually more common than you think the bile starts to thicken in the tubes and cause backup in the pancreas and can even create inflammation of the pancreas called pancreatitis in which case the remedy is tudka that will thin the body give you a tremendous amount of relief don low IQ on the area of nutrition and food and diet and it went to the exact opposite extreme focusing most of my time now on studying this topic if a doctor diagnos you and says it and go to another doctor and realize when someone gives you prescription or even a remedy for something like this you have to question is this really correct the underlying cause or is this suppressing in a symptom that will keep the problem there longer	Success
What BLOATING Really Means	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrY61zNEL_g	Dr. Eric Berg DC	the most common sign of a leaky gut is bloating in your gut you have these little tiny upside down Roots when you start to develop a leaky gut you getting this crevice or hole between these little hair-like projections where all sorts of things can travel through without getting the stamp of approval from your immune system let example you ate something with egg and some of that protein leaks down and gets through the intestine your immune cells are going to go crazy because they going to think this is a virus or a bacteria or some type of pathogen and so what it it so the next time you eat peanuts all of a sudden you have this immune reaction and you didn the same thing will happen with eggs protein or anything so here you are all of a sudden allergic to all these different foods and you don and this generates a lot of inflammation and joint pain it up on a lot of different types of skin reactions psoriasis dermatitis you may even notice headaches because you have this connection between the gut and your brain but the most damaging thing that a leaky gut will do it can set you up for an autoimmune disease things like Hashimoto which is a thyroid autoimmune condition where your own immune system is attacking your own tissues but now the big question is what causes is a leaky gut if we can dig down into that then we can get rid of the bloating and all the other symptoms associated with it the seven most common causes of a leaky gut I Seven gluten okay gluten is in grains the only protein that we as humans cannot digest and many people might have an allergy to it or they might just have an intolerance to it now the next thing that can cause leaky gut is sugar consuming a lot of sugar creates like a rusting effect effect throughout the entire body number five fiber fiber is considered something that to our guts and it is because it feeds our microbes but the problem is if you have leaky gut now when you consume that fiber you because we have a disruption of all the microbes in your gut and they can just create a lot of gas for you all right number four lectins in beans especially it that were fed grains if it says grass-fed you grass-fed assume it three certain raw vegetables like broccoli it could be cauliflower it could be cabbage number two seed oils I and these foods are highly inflammatory and they definitely will create leakiness in your gut number one a vitamin D deficiency regardless of whether you gluten you know or going carnivore because you can couple months you need to take good amounts of vitamin D to fully heal your gut now either get a lot of sun without becoming burned or start taking at least 20,000 IUS of vitamin D3 every single day now this will start you on the road to Healing the gut but there other things you need to be aware of as well and that would be glutamine glutamine is most important for the gut and the food that glutamine is red meat another food that can get it in sour crra other food that eggs kefir another thing to think about is zinc you know oysters have the most sink but any type of shellfish or seafood you can also do seelp as well and the last most important thing you can do is to give your digestive system a chance to rest and repair and this is called fasting that right there will probably be the most important thing to do to really turning in the situation around and I wish someone told me what I right now	Success
DON'T DO THIS IF YOU'RE OVER 50!!!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today I nutrients you should be careful of taking as you age especially over the age of 50 then I what nutrients you should probably take more of as you age so let with what to not take first one on the list is iron our bodies do not have a good way of getting rid of excess iron and too much iron in the body creates damage in the liver if you were to take iron on a regular basis that could even increase your risk of getting an infection if your immune system is low because you plenty of food also when you take more iron it depletes zinc really one of the only remedies is just to donate blood to get rid of some of this iron now if someone menstruating they rid of blood every month but in any situation that someone recommend to get your iron from like red meat liver grass-fed liver pills or spleen extract the next Min we to talk about is calcium far too many people are taking too much calcium we develop a lot of extra calcium that builds up in the arteries and the calcium can also build up in the kidneys as well just think about like people that have high blood pressure what do they take they take a calcium channel blocker now the other point about calcium is that I do recommend a lot of vitamin D because it important but one of the side effects of vitamin D in higher Amounts is hypercalcemia what is that that much calcium in the blood now I recommend taking high doses of vitamin D3 if you have autoimmune problems or you have a lot of inflammation because we in the blood next vitamin on the list is vitamin A but I natural vitamin A I synthetic version of vitamin A because they can become a problem especially if you with the liver as in liver damage osteoporosis and increase intracranial pressure so that natural version of vitamin A is totally fine you can get that from civer oil you can get it from egg yolks get it from butter but I would avoid taking any synthetic vitamin A you would think sodium would be on this list but sodium is very necessary for you to take especially as you age so sodium is necessary to give you energy following up with that let vitamins that you need more of as you age there vitamin C and then there version in the past I against synthetic vitamin C but since then I found there and a place for taking large amounts of vitamin C for various things one is just to lower your histamine so if you have this allergy attack it seems to do wonders for that and even one being to help with cancer but on the flip side I also recommend taking the vitamin see from sauerkraut would also be a good idea all right next vitamin on the list this one vitamin B3 in the form of nasin the problem with nasin it gives you this flush if you start off with very small amounts like you start with 50 milligrams and slowly go to 100 milligrams but I personally take about 500 to 1,000 milligrams of nin every single day anyone over the age of 50 should do that it things that can increase good cholesterol it helps to repair DNA it helps with giving you energy then we get to the mineral called magnesium magnesium is the thing that counters this calcification problem it keeps the calcium from building up inside the cells great for blood pressure great for muscle cramps great for energy great for sleeping and great for lowering your cortisol okay let one vitamin D I think most people need a lot more than they 10,000 IUS I milon reasons why but if you have any thought that that think about this if you out in the sun for about 40 minutes okay you 20,000 IUS of vitamin D3 so why in the heck would 10,000 I use be a toxic amount the next vitamin I talk about you needing is vitamin K1 now vitamin K1 has the function of clotting the body there people have that if I take too much K1 I false information when you take even high doses of vitamin K1 the blood will only clot to the normal amount it won give you extra clotting it to create a clot or a clogged artery they should be consuming foods that are high in vitamin K1 dark leafy greens are loaded with vitamin K1 the last vitamin that I vitamin K2 it not only helps you mobilize calcium and keep the calcium in the bone where it should be but it also has other benefits too for energy to support the mitochondria	Success
Everyone IGNORES This Part of Their Body	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	there are nine things I about today about fascia that will literally blow your mind now I went through a lot of training on the body anatomy physiology when we talked about fascia it was this extra passive tissue you know like bubble wrap that just packs certain things fascia is the Matrix or the material that surrounds every muscle in the body like let me just give you an example we take this weight for example and I start lifting it like this right for about I don know 20 times I I this now if we attach some fossil tissue to the weight okay and do that I lifting the weight but I less energy because I energy from the elastic band that gives you a lot of transfer of energy running jumping Etc is not just about contraction and relaxation of muscles it and ligaments and fascia and then releasing it fascia gives you your posture I mean you ever see people when they get older like some people literally are looking straight down when they totally prevented if they understood how to keep the fascia healthy and repair it which I of this video fascia also gives you your body shape FASA also has similar properties to liquid crystals in those like digital TVs it has these repeating patterns of similar type shapes that have the ability to change and adapt to the environment the little cells that make fascia or collagen are called fibroblasts and these little cells are like little spiders that can migrate they can move through your body and you have millions of them all over the place and they it for lubrication and movement and the next one is they are highly involved with the immune system this is why our fascia can be sore as in fibromyalgia and planer fasciitis and over time that injury becomes an inhesion so this is why uh my fascial release and other techniques massage and trigger point therapy are all really important especially if you had injuries now when you stop moving the collagen is going to get sticky it stiff and the fascia is going to fuse together and stiffen and when you start moving that tissue it you move it restricted and maybe in your mind you might think oh wow I have a tight muscle no you don fascia is also connected from head to toe and so knowing this really helped me understand why certain techniques worked when I was in practice for example when people would come in and have injuries on their tailbone I found the best relief I can give them is by working on the back of the neck the oxa put releasing the oxa put seems to help tailbone injuries now why would that work because of fascia it connected I fascia and making it longer so there more space another example would be people that had uh problems with their shoulder they couldn would have them lay face down and if they had a restriction on the left shoulder I would work on the right calf and achilles tendon and that always seemed to open up the shoulder why is that because the fascia on the right lower part of your body is connected to the left shoulder another example would be people that had right shoulder pain through here I would work on the gall letter area now in the past I would talk about the frenic nerve being involved which is probably true but I think also all the fascia that surround that frenic nerve that go all the way up into the third cervical vertebrae through here with all the different fascia attachments so as I loosened this part up it freed up this part fascia is extremely inated by little tiny nerves that allows the body to know where it is in space and this is why the fos is very important for balance coordination and it has this amazing ability to be able to change its material properties it can go from being very rigid to very elastic if you sit all day and don the environmental message is don just get tight and hold the person in that position so you see this in the nursing homes a lot with people in this one position like all day sitting they body just grows like that it communication with your environment unless you get an injury in other words when you start walking or moving now things have changed because we had that injury and now you bit on one side of your body so the secret to restoring fascia has to do with adding Dynamic motions from different directions so it and over and over again I remember in my 30s the only exercise that I did I mean it was just biking over and over and over and over my soaz muscles which are the hip flexors became so tight because I was doing that same motion over and over and over again I videos that I below but there find I want to give you the general principles of what to do another thing that I doses of of vitamin D3 I IUS every single day if you going to do a similar thing with vitamin D you want to make sure you take the co-actors vitamin K2 and magnesium and zinc and B6 and that way you can prevent any problems that may come up from taking high doses of vitamin D and if you want more information about vitamin D and the co-actors you should watch this video right here	Success
6 DEVASTATING Vitamin Deficiencies	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQi-jsRFK4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	one of the big missing things in medicine is the recognition that there are nutritional deficiencies that cause a lot of health problems they kind of downplay that instead you have this cause and effect relationship and the cause which medically they call it idiopathic which means unknown cause so today I devastating problems with a nutritional deficiency so the first one is called neosia okay this is a condition to describe where your nervous system and your brain is depleted it and you associated symptoms fatigue mood problems like you probably apathetic the nutrient that you need to supply in certain amounts in sufficient Amounts is vitamin B3 in the form of niin and you need about 500 milligrams to start out with for maybe 3 days and then graduate up to about a, milligrams of nasin every single day you can split it up like 500 in the morning 500 at lunchtime now of course given the fact that you your diet as well you have to do other things but nin is the solution for that one the next condition is tourettes sudden involuntary movements or verbal Outburst this problem is also a B3 deficiency but to remedy it you don want to use niin you want to use the other version called nicomide so what you you system and you need about 500 to 1,000 Mig of Nomine now what about this is the first condition is where you have complete exhaustion of your brain and nervous system and you using nasin to help fix that whereas this condition you to generate more energy to calm down this sudden outbreak so it create a a calming effect now this next condition is pretty interesting uh the name of it is called persecutory delusions you can have various mental symptoms from a nutritional deficiency because persecutory delusions are basically the feeling that you to either be harmed or someone to mistreat you I when people start putting labels on people and diagnosing them most of these mental disorders are purely subjective I mean just think about what you would feel like if someone told you you were delusional right you really happy about that you be very upset about that and associated with that you have apathy you have disorganized thoughts lack of clarity lack of focus and also from this one nutritional deficiency you can have an auditory or a visual hallucination and this deficiency is vitamin B12 a B12 deficiency can create a problem in your nervous system where it perception on reality and you can actually see certain things that are not there the next one is restless leg syndrome this is the urge to move your body especially the lower part of your body your legs usually when you sleeping I had this for many years in the middle of the night it would wake me up I had to pound my legs I just could not be comfortable and this is either a vitamin B1 deficiency or it could be an iron deficiency now what could you do to figure out if it you could go get a test for the deficiencies but you first have to know that it could be either a B1 or an iron deficiency there are a few other ways to quickly identify if it deficiency or a B1 deficiency for example if it anemia um the palm of your hands might look a little pale the inside of your eyelids will look a little pale the nail beds look pale and white so if you don have that chances are it could be more of a B1 deficiency which is usually caused from consuming too many refined carbohydrates or sugar then we get something called Panic anxiety worry especially if you are thinking thinking thinking thinking especially before bed and cannot turn it off this is usually a B1 deficiency uh I wouldn taking high doses of B1 because vitamin B1 is water cble now you could take the fat cble one as well called botam but I find that that one is more for perial neuropathy you want to just take the regular natural version of be one for these other issues but it amazing in practice I would use it and within minutes a person would just feel very calm and very good if you haven tried it you might want to try it and the last one is the sensation of impending doom like something bad is going to happen this is another example of a mental problem that physical nutrient deficiency and this one is vitamin D3 I would recommend 20,000 I use of vitamin D3 daily for a few months now these are all really interesting cause effect relationships if you haven identifying nutritional deficiencies based on certain symptoms I put that video up right here check it out	Success
7 Stupid Health Mistakes	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3owmZ_QnY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	there are seven stupid mistakes people make regarding their health number one getting the wrong advice and then accepting that advice as a fact you know you go to the doctor and they might ask you about what you I magnesium Etc and they kind of go oh you don can get that from your diet and then you accept it as a fact unfortunately just because someone has an MD behind their name or even a PhD behind their name doesn the information they haven at it they just tell you their opinion and then you accept it so that would be a big mistake and this definitely relates to a vitamin D deficiency there is so much valuable information on vitamin D that literature and if you just do a superficial look at you know the first three pages on Google you going to find all sorts of uh bias information and oh yeah vitamin D doesn from our diet or the Sun and that is just ter information because so many people have vitamin D resistance so the normal typical amounts even if it 2,000 I use are not going to do anything they therapeutic effect number two a person is depending on all their protein requirements from a protein powder and it protein you or minerals or other things that are in animal Meats now the other thing that comes with that is when you just consume meat and you all of your proteins did you realize that out of all the proteins in your body 30% is collagen there of collagen in meat now if you eat a tender steak for example you getting like 1 to 2% collagen all right number three basically a problem with medicine the whole system you treat the symptom you don cause now I doctors that are mending a bone from a fracture or if you go to the doctor for an infection I treat chronic disease you know with certain pills a really good example is just blood sugar right so normally you should have a certain amount of normal blood sugar even if you do eat carbs this hormone called insulin comes in there takes the sugar out of the blood so you can have normal blood sugars so yes that whole system of medicine is really stupid so the next time you your doctor ask him is there going to be any point in this treatment program that I because medication fixed it all right number four the hyperfocus on reducing your salt content for high blood pressure I mean in nutrition science you need like twice as much potassium to sodium as far as the ratios I mean it would probably be better if you add four times the potassium to the sodium so instead of focusing on lowering your sodium which is going to create weakness and other problems why not increase the pottassium and if someone really were to evaluate what potassium does to your arteries it keeps them flexible all right number five having this idea that unsaturated fats are somehow healthier than saturated fats and I about these unsaturated fats the heart healthy unsaturated fats it is highly refined and it single junk food which is called alra processed foods and yes it might lower your cholesterol a little bit but what about all the other damage that it can do and I out the inside of your arteries creating inflammation Etc all right number six this idea that red meat is junk food we long time it still retains all the vitamins the minerals the other stuff that yes there is different levels of processed meat but to lump in the red meat with the processed meat and even you know state that they are both the same as far as causing cancer is stupid because red meat is one of the most healing things that you can consume especially for gut health in fact it was the thing that actually turned me around just within probably minutes I remember years ago when I was a junk food junkie and then I just started to consume red meat for breakfast and it was like a miracle overnight I just felt like the brain fog went away I started feeling better all right and number seven reading nutrition facts this unfortunately is a very stupid mistake because if you actually started reading the nutrition facts you shocked it focus on the nutritional facts through up here all these numbers right here I mean it gives you some data but you really can you read the ingredients and of course the first one is sugars okay and of course they have sugars hidden is other words like high fructose corn syrup things like that and that and number two is all the seed oils like corn oil uh canola soy oil cotton seed oil but number three starch starch is really the hidden sugar that people don this product right here if you look at the total carbohydrate and this is actually very interesting 16 gram of carbohydrate guess how much sugar is in here zero all right if we take the 16 G of carbohydrate which is really hidden sugars and then we multiply it by the number of serving sizes this right here is 50 six teaspoons of sugar and this one bag of Doritos these refined starches act on your blood sugars worse than actual sugar but it classified as zero sugars you see the problem a person is literally going to make stupid choices because it now since we I think uh this next video on Malto dein will blow you away

Your Body Is BEGGING for Vitamin D!!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAQ7r6jLEww	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we Professor Bruce Hollis the Pioneer in vitamin D research you this extremely fascinating let Right In so Dr Hollis I I watched one of your videos and I literally had to put it on pause because you said something that blew me away I before in my life and I had to spend the next eight hours trying to validate what you said which is absolutely 100% true and this little piece of information will explain a lot of I think the confusions that people observe when they see negative research on vitamin D and a lot of other things so that piece of information was related to um there actually two different systems in the body that deal with vitamin D uh there I guess one with bone and skeleton and then there everything else can you kind of just as simple as possible kind of explain those two systems yeah the first system uh the one that was discovered decades ago that vitamin D was associated with skeletal integrity and M maintaining um blood calcium levels in a strict fashion and and it to be it has to be uh maintained all the time and so that system involves uh vitamin D and parathyroid hormone um kidneys and that as the endocrine function of vitamin D and that identified vitamin D with and then as time went on um molecular biology came into a focus they started finding um cells that had the ability to respond to vitamin D that had nothing to do with the skeleton immune cells cancer cells uh uh placental cells uh and list goes on and on and it turn turns out that that called the paracrine and intercrine system and that is depending on uh how much vitamin D can get into these cells and be activated and then carry out their function I mean just in the human body give or take there are 20,000 different genes that are controlled um uh for various functions vitamin D has the ability to control 10% or 2,000 of those genes in one fashion or another and so to to basically brush that aside as a lot of my colleagues did uh just saying it any sense to me so if we take a look at these two systems when you get your blood test done in vitamin D you looking at a the inactive version of you vitamin D that how does that relate with these two different systems well here we get it gets pretty technical so have you have when people refer to vitamin D mostly when they refer to vitamin D it form you get when you take a supplement or when you make it in your skin when the Sun hits your skin um that call that the vitamin D or the parent compound and then that compound goes into the circulation it doesn there very long and but it gets turned into another compound called 25 hydroxy vitamin D and when they test your blood right the immediate form the intermediate form that stays in your blood for weeks okay okay and that good and a bad thing because it it stays around for a long time but it accessible to these tissues that need it it it maintains blood calcium and then finally uh the uh the that compound is turned into another compound which is really one of the most potent hormones known and that D and that uh that that all these Gene functions and all these tissues so so the one when you go to the doctor and get your blood test you looking at not the active form it inactive form that can stay around in the blood for a c several weeks it yes it reservoir okay it vitamin D that it and then it turns turns into the active form or a certain amount will turn into the active form but then how does that relate to these two different systems well so the in that intermediate form the reservoir form can turn into the active form in the kidney that highly regulated and that that calcium okay that intermediate form can also go into any cell in the body okay and be turned in to the active form and function in that given cell whether it be a cancer cell to stop cancer from progressing or immune cells uh to make make them function in the appropriate fashion and uh also the the problem with that intermediate form is it accessible to these cells it can it it it out that so long so the the parent compound the one that you take in the supplement turns out it can get into any of these cells and be activated all the way down the chain to the active form the problem is that form disappears within a day yeah so so it needs to be replenished every day to have the full function of the vitamin present say it complicated that Physicians don or scientists as well so this this this is kind of what I want to get into this this point that you just mentioned because you have the different types and then when people get their blood tested they there the blood so everything satisfied but that true no that form that important okay it important for maintenance of blood calcium and skeleton but for the other functions the only way that you can you you can be sure that you have adequate Amounts is basically take it every day either orally or get in the Sun every day and of course that a lot of reasons so the oral consumption of vitamin D on a daily or at a minimum on a weekly basis uh is is important because that that the that that form comes and goes very quickly wow so this has to do with like halflife and um breaking down some of it goes down quick some stays in there so now in one of your videos you me you went through a bunch of studies and you showed people step by step um like number of studies that were that failed that showed no response with vitamin D and you correlated that with h well that take it once a week or once a month versus there been even been one study on skeleton where they took it once a year like a million units once a year and then they said well this didn very well and that continues to be cited in some facts as being harmful it idiotic oh my gosh if someone takes a million um I use a vitamin D just one time um I think um after after a day it goes down to half and then the day later it goes down to a quarter right it just kind of breaks down and then goes away or or it just becomes yeah it it boost the intermediate form for a while but it inefficient uh of way of doing it and it becomes more so if you do it once a day it efficient once a month even less efficient so yeah so wow as far as the the the research on this um what about um you know you have all these most of the researchers out there they vitamin D just just related to Bone and calcium they almost pretending like this other system doesn basically yes I mean first you have to accept the fact that vitamin D has functions on calcium and I mean the data are all over but what what ends up happening is things are run like the vital trial yeah where they they give too little vitamin D they give it to people who in know in a randomized trial who who who don like uh in the the the Townson newsletter I mentioned to you when I was discussing it with the author of that paper so the gold standard for all drug trials or randomized control trials okay where say you have a cholesterol drug and you want to test if it truly will depress serum cholesterol if you take it so the drug company assembles uh assembles a population of people and they administer half of those people a drug and half of those people get Placebo and then they they uh analyze the and and look at it and of course they it successful and this is how drug trials are run but the drug that you those people the body has never seen it they don it unlike nutrients not just vitamin D but any nutrient trial okay it impossible in this country to do a true randomized trial because the population you people have very little some people have plenty but when you if you just take them at random and and and randomize them and give these people half of them a a level of vitamin D oftentimes not even enough and the other half only get Placebo or and Placebo in this country means they have to get the standard daily dose so they zero and what happens is is that it horribly compromised study so that what vital in all these uh happens is that and the other thing is when you when you end it and you do your data analysis wouldn might take the basil level into effect when you do the analysis of the data well that that that that violates intent to treat model okay and it absolutely ensures that your trial is going to fail so and I and I we did pregn pregnancy studies and found out that vitamin D decreased complications of birth and but the best trials were actually done overseas and the best one couple were done in actually in Iran and where the population is generally vitamin D deficient across the board and they had a fairly large patient population half of those women got a substantial dose of vitamin D and half of those people got nothing which is how you can trial like that in the US because you be violating standard of care but over but that should be run and and and in those trials we saw tremendous effects on on decrease in birth complications like pre-term birth and preclampsia and and and diabetes and and everything else fell into the treatment group if you do the same trial in the US you you you can better people have better vitamin D levels but when you randomize them like I said everybody has some and so it that has none and when and when you look at the results it it overcome that to some degree when when the statisticians would take their the basil level upon study entry into effect and then you analyze it like that you can see effects and that and in fact that why observational studies uh you know when they have these big groups of people and they look at vitamin D levels and outcomes via cancer via pregnancy and and things and it lifestyle okay and and uniformly those studies and there really big effects of vitamin D but then when you went to do these randomized trials and you had all these complications and you can the base level all of that disappears and you get no you get no effect at all but if you if you submit your paper to New England Journal or jamama or British medical journal and you and you analyze the data and want to take into account basil levels that violates the intent to treat model and it will be rejected outright wow wow so so the vital study is definitely um the study that certain groups are using to to tell people well see see it doesn did the study it definitive like I authors of that study to reanalyze their data taking Baseline levels into account of their patient and they won incredible and they didn call um their the amount of vitamin D they were giving people a high dose at 2,000 iuse yeah that nothing per to put it in perspective I I vitamin D a day and I have for years and my level vitamin D levels are between 80 and 90 nanograms per ML and my the my personal care physician is is pretty um Progressive she uh she all for that not just with me but for her entire entire clinical uh uh group of of patients that she follows and so she wants her patients to have a minimum level of 60 that compared to most you know Family Care Physicians or Primary Care docs in fact they male clinic or Cleveland Clinic or whatever and those those levels like mine which are 80 or 90 will be flagged as too high right and I get those I get those emails from people all the time wow it about the normals for a second because I think it there definitively right there different ideas on it again if you go back to what agreed upon range it skeletal models right right and and and the skeletal models that that we haven on those two systems are different you can maintain a skeletal model on a relatively low amount of you know say 25 or 30 nanograms or maybe even lower where you can maintain a normal skeletal level where the other system requires much higher levels in that to function in a normal fashion incredible what are the ranges for the other system uh other than the bone in the skeletal oh I I want to have cancer prevention or cancer treatment it prevent cancer that have active active neoplasia that different ball game that pharmacology so your levels would be higher but but for prevention and optimal functions I me a Minimum level would be 50 so 50 to 100 and that within the normal physiologic range in Sun repleted populations so if you spend a lot of time and we years and people lifeguards or athletes who are outside in the sun in in the summer months or people who live in the tropics who take their levels are routine the 890 100 nigs that is not an abnormal level from Human physiology in fact that time this is incredible data so um so you do have prevention then you have the the therapeutic dose when someone has a chronic inflammatory condition autoimmune or cancer those levels I would imagine need to be a bit over a hundred right yeah or even higher I mean there Brazil where uh this I can the Cambria protocol yeah KRA yeah he he they dose with several hundred thousand their their levels are you know 5600 nanograms to for the suppression of of Ms and it has basis in fact because vitamin D at those levels is an immune suppressor so excuse me it will it will alter the T the t- cells in the favor of T2 away from T1 T1 are the ones that cause autoimmune attack and so vitamin D at H at those levels and and some of those people show that uh those vitamin D at those levels are more effective than the drugs that are prescribed of course vitamin D is free essentially and those drugs are enormously expensive to take every month with severe side effects right so what what about cancer you mentioned one of the videos about prostate cancer so you know with prostate cancer um we did a study more than 10 years ago now where we looked at I went to at the time I went into uh the chief of our urology department at the Medical University of South Carolina where I was on on faculty and and another fellow and I went in and talked to him and uh he it was a friend of mine and I said to them I said look we want to do a a a study in your P group of patients on the patients who are have active surveillance or watching weight you know what that is so we you go in to have your prostate your PSA is going up they do a biopsy and and your your your uh prostate cancer is low gr say leas and six so the doctor says to you well we prefer to really do nothing you know we want to watch and wait which means I a year see if it worse okay so we said we want to do a study on these guys and what we want to do is we at the time every time we did these studies you had to propose how much you were going to give the patient and so if you go back to this period of time which is in the 20056 Years some back there we wanted to give a really modest dose of 4,000 units a day I would have liked to give more but at the time you have to go through an Institutional review board and they have to okay it and so um and and most of this unfortunately where we are and stuff most of the prostate cancer occurs in the African-American population which are really deficient in vitamin D so we approached them and we said we want to do this and we want to give them 4,000 units of vitamin D at day um and it was an Interventional trial it wasn we had historical data on patients that were in that in that practice and so we put them on 4,000 units a day and we monitored their levels and and then at the end of the year they got to repeat rectal biopsy for like you get for prostate cancer and we looked at the the cell grade and the retention or or the how it progressed and in in 64% the tumors regressed wow wow and we submitted this to Course New England Journal and they wanted nothing to do with it so we submit it it finally got published in the journal of clinical endocr endocrinology and Metabolism which is a respectable uh endocrine journal and uh um it really went nowhere I mean if it would have been a drug that a drug company had it would have been worth billions yeah so so when when people treat cancer like that like prostate cancer 4,000 is nothing I or more because you got cancer you not dealing in normal physiology here you you and the push back you get if you try to put these trials well I example of a of a study called the Sunshine study which is a study on non-resectable colon cancer okay run out of Harvard and several other and and in those studies they were they were giving vitamin D prior to giving chemotherapy and to see if if priming these people with a level of vitamin D prior to giving them chemal therapy had an effect and so sure enough I mean the file stud being done but the initial study that was published a couple of years ago after the data was looked at it basically extended the patients lives by two months if you primed them with vitamin D and it was only like 8,000 maybe 10,000 units a day you know which at the time I I said to the primary investigator on that study I said why don 50,000 no and and the response I got back is we can IRB I said these people are D you them you know really potent chemotherapeutic drugs and you worried about giving them you know vitamin D yeah right God yeah they dying they got they you you can they they know a substantial and so be that as it may even that the doses they gave in conjunction with the chemotherapy extended their lives by two months and in cancer chemotherapy that deal okay drugs are approved on that basis but it was funny because it was sent to jam and and it was the initial data the way it was analyzed by the School of Public Health at Harvard showed significance at like 0.0035 and and then jamama comes back and says well we want you to do it this way so do it that way and it comes back like 0.045 or something and no no now we want you to do it this way so then it comes back at 0.051 and then they say okay that but you got to say it significant and we article the only thing that shows up in the news was that vitamin D was not was not significant in progressing in treating the cancer that false well it look at if you look at your level of significance like Point difference between 0.005 and 051 so that thousand versus 51 patients in a I mean it the the term not significant into the article holy macro so so what you saying all the time so what you saying is there there is some slight resistance by these journals and I being very sarcastic it medical journals there is huge resistance to it there was an article that just came out in Science magazine that showed that vitamin D and the mechanism of how through the microbiome it regulates colon cancer and that actually got published it it it mechanism how Vitamin D works at at at at not at a not at an endocrine level but this cellular level to regulate cancer immunity in in in these patients wow so so um as far as the um storage of I I was under the assumption that uh all this vitamin D gets stored in your fat and then when you need it the body pulls it out but that that wow yeah fat soluble vitamin goes into your fat when you need here and I even heard people in the old days saying well you know what happens when you have a bariatric surgery and you have a lot of vitamin D and it pours in the vitamin D toxic well that was totally ridiculous I mean it doesn you know it might Supply a little bit but it not I mean maybe enough to to to uh Supply the enderin portion for a while but it definitely isn supply the the cular portion because one one of I think you even studied you you tried to find vitamin D stored and you couldn looked at levels in fat so other things are stored as Esters like fatty acid esters and fat tissue so we we would dose we would dose even humans and take fat samples you know and and look for it and it there was nothing special about fat tissue about vitamin D being in there I mean there was some in there because it just distributes in tissues in general but it wasn against a gradient where you had this high level of vitamin D and fat tissue wow you also mentioned the relationship between vitamin D and um even the endothelial layer in the inside of your artery is becoming a bit leaky yes some you know if you go back several this wasn it happened it was done by a group of biochemists in um in Utah and what they had uh they I believe it syndrome where you have uh these leaky vessels in your brain uh it metabolic defect and they leak fluid and these guys were looking for compounds that would avert or be more therapeutic so these endothelial vessels wouldn weak okay my coffee machine is turning off here so that de so anyway they they had this system where they ran thousands of compounds through this to test for this leakage and uh and what they found was they found two compounds one of which was vitamin D which they were really disappointed by because uh you know good old vitamin D with a stabilizer of endothelial function meaning it stopped the leakage and it was and the interesting thing there was the parent compound vitamin D itself was the most potent wow not to other forms but vitamin D itself so you talk about the ones in supplements who getting it from the Sun yeah the one we or in your vitamin supplement was the most potent at at overcoming this endothelial function you know one of the other things that we did in our pediatric work was in it has to do with human lactation yeah so you know when I go back to my graduate school days and I was you know I was you know not the best student because I always question my mentors you know and so we were taught and I was a I was a nutritional biochemist by training and in the training you I they would teach well you know cuan milk is the perfect food for the nursing infant except for one thing they could get rickets if they take it so you got to give them a supplement I I thought that makes no sense whatsoever right why how could that be and so you know at time goes on and we we you know we we do research and it goes for decades and finally we figured out that to overcome this problem the mothers were taken too little vitamin D by the recommendations that were being made by the different organizations so once we could measure the stuff in milk and blood and look at how much was passed into the milk from the blood and um and it turned out that that you a nursing a woman who lactating needs to take about 6,000 units a day to pass enough vitamin D into her milk to satisfy her infant and then the infant doesn drops every day she from the mother mother units a day and actually that has been implemented in pediatric practice to some degree on Progressive pediatricians who actually pay attention so it option now instead of giving uh instead of giving uh the nursing infant 400 units drops because mother is enough because she deficient herself I I wonder if this postpartum depression is related to this vitamin D because low vitamin D it some of that but uh in our studies that we ran in pregnancy but you know it it have enough to really make an assessment if that because vitamin D has neural effects how does um this this idea of vitamin D resistance on top of all these other issues we have vitamin D resistance you have the vitamin D receptor you have certain microbes like that are involved in limes disease you have epin bar virus that that competitively downgrade receptors on top of everything else have you looked into that uh I haven hereditary they have hereditary resistance because their receptors are metabolic metabolically inactive yeah uh you know um it again it but to look at those kinds of studies or to run first of all at this point in time nobody any more vitamin D trials it really yeah it can would go into somebody LA to study vitamin D metabolism is committing career suicide because you isn the vital study and these these articles like Scientific American had totally decimated vitamin D research and trials are expensive to run uh the government won drug companies don don they compete with uh with drug that they have in development such as the the drugs for prostate cancer you have one that at at suppressing prostate cancer and uh it doesn pharmaceutical companies want that knowledge out there it totally criminal or or or in vitamin D in in preventing pre-term birth or complications there was a drug called McKenna that was 177 hydroxy progesterone remember that one isn that for cancer that was for cancer no no this was for prevention of pre-term birth okay okay it was injectable it was I don a small biotech company back in 2010 this company was uh was bought out by a bigger company and it was U uh they had this one drug 7 17 hydroxy progesterone which was called McKenna it was approved as a speedy uh approval by the FDA there was only one problem it never worked it was expensive and it was a absolute abject failure and two years ago the FDA pulled made him pull it from the market and was it a progesterone or was it a it was 17 hydroxy progesterone you can look it up you you can you can look at the history of it and uh so it was doing they were proposing a something that vitamin D actually does which was appropriate vitamin D levels can reduce pre- birth but it money in it no and it you also mentioned in in one of your videos um um it realize that vitamin D needs magnesium as the co-actor it does yeah it it uh you know I I reviewed a lot of papers years ago and I remember reviewing is one that clearly showed that magnesium status was a was a a potentiator of improving metabolism of vitamin D within the cells meaning it was a simple thing so people who had better magnesium status also had higher levels of the intermediate form of vitamin D to 25d form that you get measured and so I myself was taking a a fair amount of vitamin D but I really wasn satisfied of of what my blood levels were and there and I I I mentioned that what people take is very individualistic of how you respond some people are really good metabolites some people AR aren more to get their blood levels you you only know what it is if you haven tested and so I started taking magnesium and and instantly increased my blood levels by about 40% and there to know if your magnesium repete because it so the only way to know it is I take I think 400 milligrams a day of magnesium oxides Ju Just A supplement every day that and and then you know your vitamin your magnesium repete for now other reasons just vitamin D so it co-actor yeah and in the metabolism of vitamin D so it interacts the enzyme that act activates vitamin D that there magnesium it have you ever done any research on vitamin D and mitochondria I I haven there them is located in the mitochondria and one of them is located in the microsomes different cellular components so that that that activate vitamin D are within the cell one in the mitochondria at one of the micr oh wow that important the mitochondria as far as I does or what if it how it influences the mitochondria which is so so much of a problem with so many people if someone takes a higher doses uh like a large dose of uh vitamin D3 isn that it does turn turn into inert compounds I think I uh it was one was called um tacol or lumisol well those those are things those compounds are made in the skin by sun exposure it ways that the body regulates how much vitamin D so so if you as a ghost and you go out in the Summer sun and and expose yourself to 20 minutes or so of intense sunlight on the initial exposure you about 20,000 units of vitamin D that be released into your blood over the next day okay but then you start tanning and that exposure becomes less you know you you the next day you and less and less and and that the the production of these tools and and lumisterol and all these things uh um probably assist in Banting the effect of D made by the Sun but in the body once you take once you take vitamin D I those things I think it just disappears you know the body will just excrete it through the bile acid functions and then activate it but those what you mentioning is a control point for the sun solar uh production of vitamin D in your skin okay and then as far as the you know you have hyperal CIA um I think they have exaggerated that a bit but U what the research on the tox you know even people are saying oh you taking 10,000 you get kidney stones like really well vitamin D has never been associated in studies with getting kidney stones wow I mean most kidney stones are oxalates I mean it it can I mean so if you kidney stones and vitamin D uh and if people are taking high doses say they taking 30 40 50,000 units for cancer my my first my recommendation would be limit your Dairy intake okay the other thing is that before anything happens in the blood it happens in the urine first so if you you know high blood calcium or too much vitamin D you would have your urinary calcium monitored as long as there calcium being dumped into your urine you don problem and at 20,000 units I mean there are rare genetic defects that would cause uh uh uh vitamin D to become toxic and one of those is a an enzyme that inactivates vitamin B called the 24 hydroxylase in the kidney and other tissues and if you have a defect in that enzyme then it become toxic but those are really rare defects so if we take those out of the picture how many people really end up getting hypercalcemia from we never saw one and all and we our studies that we did in pregnancy and lactation when when I propose to do these studies and back then you could get this is in the early 2000s so when we propos to do these studies in pregnancy and and and pregnancy is most sensitive group you can do studies in so we were proposing in these studies that we were going to give pregnant women 4,000 units a day because that would need uh to become sufficient it probably low but you know you have to start somewhere and at the time 2,000 units was the UL mean upper limit of safety so we proposed 4,000 and and so the the granting agency saw yeah this Grant you people so we said no we won the the funding agency said we conditionally approved this grant if you go to the FDA and get an IND number investigational drug number that drug companies have to do when they come up with new drugs we had to do it for vitamin D okay and we did it we we submitted an IND it delayed the study by a year and the U and the FDA granted our indd application and as a consequence we had massive monitoring we had monitoring committees we had to report to FDA every month and we never saw an adverse event due to vitamin D supplementation and a lot of other people used our IND for other things other you know there were all kinds of studies going on never once was a an intake to we saw hyper Calum or hypercal if if we saw it usually was due to something like dehydration but it was never due to vitamin D supplementation in incredible um know knowing the importance of vitamin D like I it one of the probably the most important vitamins how did you stumble on start doing research on vitamin D did you know this in advance how important vitamin D was for the body news started when I was a graduate student at Ohio State University and at the time I was in I was in uh Agriculture and uh my adviser at the time they were looking at a at in in C CLE there fever it what happens is these dairy cattle are bred to make massive amounts of milk okay physiologically it physiologically it what happens in those cattle is they go through more and more lactations they become they can maintain serum calcium once lactation is initiated because their blood levels of calcium plummet and and it turns out why that happens is they mobilize bone calcium and as they get older and into more and more lactation Cycles it becomes impossible for them to do it so once they initiate lactation their blood calcium would drop to four or five and they just Keel over and lay there because they paralyzed and then the farmer would have to dose them with high doses of calcium and then the cow would stand right up and then it would fall again the cow would fall down so and when this happens it know they got to get the cow can anymore and the cow can so they looked at ways to make it better for the cow not to go into this condition and one of the ways was to give them really huge levels of vitamin D uh to make it stop and it was successful to some degree but there were other things that were better but that how I got into this and then and then I I I of course went more towards human nutrition and I got I was interested in the milk issue and I was interacting with with uh people in in Pediatrics and you know the first grant we came up with it back in what I was telling you about the FDA are it was basically a safety study that we were designing to look at and and based around skeleton at that time we didn about does vitamin D prevent pre-term birth and and and uh preclampsia and and pre-term diabetes and all this other stuff so we ran a study and when the data were analyzed this was uh uh this is where it was it said we analyzed the data and we said look at this vitamin D is is uh preventing pre-term birth and it preventing complications of birth and I presented it at a meeting it was in 2009 and and I mean the audience went crazy in the wrong way I mean I was attacked how dare you say this you know this is heresy this can incredible so when you when you introduce data like that you better be prepared to be hammered wow wow and then and then you know since that time it uh there was an article that uh uh that was we did called the vdart study at Harvard it was done with Scott Weiss who was a world rown asthma specialist and we found out that vitamin D could you could if you give enough vitamin D especially like preconception you could basically eliminate childhood asthma but no one will you know you know the the data are clear if you analyze it in the appropriate fashion like is discussed in this Townson newsletter article and even wise chimes in and and we learned a lot from that study like we do from all these studies that you needed to give more needed to correct Baseline levels and you could you could you know there would hardly ever be another asthma childhood asthma child born if the mothers were replete when they conceived or even started taking it early in in when they found out they pregnant uh you know most of our studies were in the first trimester because that out they to do pre-term or preconception studies is hugely but that most because the vitamin D deficiency in the trials that we run is mostly missed in the first trimester because you don even woman don so you weeks or so or maybe later than that I think it important time to eat healthy and get enough nutrition is when you before you um wow I I mean it leaves you speechless because you you you you have this knowledge and you know and it can on this anymore because when it goes to this the government first of all the the government won that we did they cost Millions uh the vital study was 30 35 million maybe more of to me it was totally wasted money because it was our studies that we did in pregnancy were probably over the terms of the grants were five or six million doar to do these clinical studies and government isn money anymore and the drug companies will pay him not to do it incredible incredible so you either accept the data that we have now and and I think that people should also not only look at the randomized trial data that that we did and and the one in and the things that were done overseas where you had true vitamin D deficiency you could do do a real randomized trial and not have it compromised by what levels were in these women in the beginning and and the the the other thing in our country is non-compliance of the patients is a serious issue they don took the vitamin one in fact they never took it at all and and you know here the other thing in intent to treat if you know that those people aren complying you can the data analysis what no that violates the intent to treat Mar wow wow these are this is this is this is stuff that people don have no clue unless you research field so I guess in certain parts of other countries around the world there where you hopefully they doing vitamin D research I don yeah I mean you know like I said there stuff still going on in Iran you know where where those countries really have a really big vitamin D deficiency problem because the lifesty women are in barkers and they the Sun and so you have a in in in places in India the same way right what about Saudi Arabia yeah Saudi Arabia too any any of the Muslim countries where they where the where the females are are restricted uh have a horrible vitamin D deficiency problem well you got me thinking about that because they you have compounded by all the diabetes they have no sun no vitamin D yeah incredible is there is there anything else that that you want to U end off with that you want people to know about this has just been mind-blowing and I gonna I I think that the only not that you say never because my like my physician is pretty Progressive on all this stuff so there are Physicians that that are but the ones who depend on their professional organizations for recommendations like the geriatric Society like OBGYN e even in in Pediatrics and if they recommendations coming out of those professional societies which are solely based on reports like the endocrine Society like which just came out with revised recommendations which are ridiculous they they should be taking uh going back to the Institute of medicine 2010 which has never been redone uh you know what you you have to look at at at programs like your own to educate people uh and fortification is only done to highly motivated individuals you know or supplementation I think fortification is a different matter but until the government would change you never you know we always sought to get fortification of product higher like milk for vitamin D like but they don so and and and so supplementation is only done is done by highly motivated individuals and and how do you you know how do you prove prevention right you know you can look at the you can look at uh observational retrospective data and a lot of the data that came out of the are you familiar with the Physicians health study at Harvard run by Walter Willet group I mean it it basically it was Physicians or Nur nures participated in this study and every year they give a blood sample and every year they fill a questionnaire what happened to you this year did you have a heart attack did you get cancer how you know and then they had these blood samples Bank millions of these samples and what they do is then they say okay we want to look at this disease related to this compound and there number of those studies done on vitamin D mostly all positive and and those data are really valuable okay because those look at lifestyle over a long period of change but they discarded when you when studies like vital say yes are they still doing that study now or are they is yes yeah health professional study still Ono okay yeah I think he involved in the what the the planetary Health diet the new planetary Health diet yeah oh yeah well it everything the most cited scientist on you know in the history of science science incredible and I know Walter will I past quite a bit on this stuff he definitely gets a lot of funding but but that study that that that that those health professional studies were a gold mine I mean and extraordinary value you know not a randomized trial but there should be paid to attention should be paid attention to yeah well I it not favorable wow this has been incredible thank you so much for taking your time to uh do this and you that link down below of that article from the Townson report so everyone can check it out but thank you so much	Success
What Happens if You STOP Using Your Cell Phone Before Bed for 14 Days	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozZ1Rcm55E	Dr. Eric Berg DC	what would happen if you were to stop using your cell phone before bed for just 14 days this is going to be very interesting the majority of the population uses their cell phone before bed and there should not do that but if they do use a cell phone there are several things you can do to minimize the problem with this the first problem with your cell phone and other mobile devices is this thing called Blue Light in the spectrum of visible light the first band of light is the blue light blue light powerfully suppresses melatonin melatonin is the hormone that helps you go to sleep at night if your melatonin is too low you to sleep and the quality of sleep is not going to be that great and this is going to lead to a whole bunch of problems the next day now you yourself like why out of all the different uh types of color why is blue the one that messes with your melatonin now in order for our bodies to have adapted to the awake and sleep cycles certain triggers were necessary you have light and darkness right and during the day what is the color of the sky blue blue is the most powerful color that suppresses melatonin because during the day you need to be alert and then when it starts to become nighttime and the Sun starts setting maybe the reddish Sunset type colors those actually don suppress melatonin this is why you should not be exposed to Blue Light before you go to bed but in the LED lighting system in your cell phone and and the digital devices you have a more intense version of this blue light then even where the sun is at Peak at 12:00 noon only 1.5 minutes of exposure to this blue light before bed can start to reduce your melatonin especially since it more intense and it eyes now with the TV screen it up blue light but it not as intense but there light therapy to help people with seasonal effect disorder during the winter time now the first thing that comes to mind is well why don use a blue light blockers okay and wear that before I go to bed so I can keep using the cell phone or a mobile device well there information about blue light blockers and for that I little demonstration right now sunglasses do not filter out blue light and the problem with sunglasses is they lower all of the spectral light to a certain degree equally but they don filter the blue this is a very specific laser that uh gives just the blue light that we want to filter and I want to show you something before we get into the blue light blockers we show you what happens with just regular sunglasses right so I put this right here and then show you we go through the sunglasses Let another pair of sunglasses right here doesn another pair of sunglasses does not filter it with a darn I will say that some some of these sunglasses do help you against the UV so at least it does something so here here this is a blue blocker I think it like 30 $32.95 so let this one does not work at all that would be a waste of money let right here this is a blue light blocker okay this one let bought a bunch of different blue blockers and you can see this one does not block the blue out waste of money let works great this one completely blocks everything out all right now let the one that costs I think $2.95 it looking one wow that blocks it really nicely see that for three bucks so I think this is the winner right here and it looks cool so I okay there with a spectroscope this is $10 this is going to just show you what happens when you look at your cell phone okay if you want to just hold this right here so when I look into this you see there cell phone and this is the problem it very intense it face when you you actually were to add something like this if you wanted to use your cell phone at night and put this in front and look through there you could see the blue light disappears so in other words if you want to sleep at night you want to wear some type of blue blocking device that really works so you cannot suppress melatonin blue light also increases cortisol to a certain degree and blue light can actually damage the eye if you have too much exposure to that Spectrum especially if you a computer all day long and then watching your cell phone at night then we get into the topic of the next problem with the cell phone and that is something called called EMF electromagnetic fields an invisible radiation that affects our whole body it creates damage within the communication signals in the cell it also can increase the risk of certain types of cancer in tumor growth because it damages part of the cell now of course I use a cell phone a lot of people use a cell phone it you can do to reduce that exposure to the EMF the one that I like is called the trifield because it doesn fields and the magnetic fields but also the radio frequency as in you know cell tower frequencies uh frequencies from routers and so it very very simple to use and I using this for several years so I think it get one of these units and start measuring the places in your environment that you spend a lot of time whether it next to a cell phone and then you can actually visualize this hidden radiation that how much is being admitted like for example when I first got this I went through my entire house and I found uh there is a tremendous amount of magnetic fields around my bed I noticed that I had heart palpitations when I slept and I felt really really tired waking up like more than usual and that I was being bathed in this huge magnetic field so it of sleep how deep you sleep and it going to affect how you feel the next day in fact every minute that you use this before you go to bed there could be a delayed sleep onset by 3.5 minutes the other thing I want to talk about is uh REM sleep so when you go to sleep you go through deep sleep okay and then you go to a superficial wave sleep which is called REM sleep and so it kind of Cycles through every 90 minutes up and down up and down versus a deep Delta wave sleep has a lot to do with repairing the physical body body more than the mental repair let what happens when your cell phone is close to your skull what we do is we cell phone and keep it as far away from your head as possible under speaker mode so you will not uh affect melatonin and you can actually sleep like a baby now there affect melatonin alcohol caffeine nicotine stress before bed and of course we also have temperature if the temperature is higher like 75° fah Your Sleep Quality is going to be very poor but there 69° that you you because when you go to sleep your core temperature does drop by one to two points people that have insomnia have a higher core temperature now what problem with crappy sleep it day okay how you feel it level it your ability to have cognitive function and have focus and concentration and creativity I had a problem with sleep for literally I one time I had Restless like syndrome the other portion of the time I just would wake up at 2 o morning and it was my cortisol that was just way too high of course I never really looked at my diet but that was really behind this whole thing I didn even use a cell phone before bed and I used to then try to do a sugar coma by cons assuming a pint of Ben and& Jerry before bed so I could sleep but that is a very stupid uh solution because you would wake up feeling groggy so what happens when your sleep is crappy you going to feel like crap the next day but also you have a higher risk of having blood sugar problems the risk of type 2 diabetes goes up by 48% there of Dementia by 33% and a 30% risk of developing a depression probably because you simple things you can do to to reduce this effect of blue light and EMF let say you have to use your cell phone uh then just wear blue light blockers that actually work when you use your cell phone use the speaker phone don this thing close to your brain okay and just by eliminating that certain blue light that difference in your melatonin and also if you candles or you have a fireplace all of that gives off infrared which can also increase melatonin so there are huge benefits of not using that cell phone before you go to bed and I gave you a little introduction to the EMF there more to know about that and for that I put up this video right here check it out	Success

#1 Vitamin to Eliminate Swollen Legs and Ankles	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBSGhpG8yfE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let swollen legs ankles and feet would you believe that I used to have pitting edema right on my ankles I would remember pressing into my lower ankle and leaving a dent I mean I old it was some years ago but even in this picture you could see my face was completely round anytime someone has a round face what that means is they have blood sugar issues but the point is I had a lot of health problems and pitting edema was definitely one of them now swollen legs are called edema and you know if you look this up it it heart problem maybe you much sodium but that case there common and I you today and this is totally easy to fix um when you watch this video if you just apply what I you will fix this very fast without taking like a blood thinner like some type of diuretic to push the fluid out I mean that comes with a package like side effects when you have fluid retention especially in your lower legs and ankles this boils down to a problem with these little tiny pumps that are not working in your cells you have millions and millions of these little tiny pumps that push fluid in and out of the cell and the specific pump that this case is called the sodium potassium pump there things about this pump it uses like 30 to 40% of all the energy that is given to that cell but if that pump goes bad like in our our house in the basement when the pump went bad we had about a foot of water in our basement if the pump goes bad in your body you to have a lot of fluid that is not going to be in the cells it outside the cells and that interstitial fluid retention so what really going on in your lower ankles is you sugar in the blood is too high and all that sugar is connected to the protein in the blood called hemoglobin so let say we have a protein bar right here representing the protein and then we have a marshmallow representing the sugar what happens when this sugar connects to the protein in your blood this is called glycation so this is a term that they use when you hear this test called A1C the A1C test measures how much sugar is stuck to your blood protein and it gives you an average of like 3 months because the red blood cell survives about 3 months and so when this sugar gets stuck to the blood protein prot it doesn there permanently until that blood cell dies and so when you eat more sugar you get more sugar stuck to this protein more sugar stuck to the protein until this protein can name for this is that the protein is glycated but the main takeaway for this is that when you eat sugar you destroy the ability for the blood cell to carry nutrition to the body to carry oxygen and this glycated protein molecule now plugs up your circulation then you get a lack of blood flow and then you get this pooling that goes on in your lower part of your body and this is that swelling because it also destroys the inside of your arteries and it creates a leakiness outside the cell the fluid that was supposed to be inside your vessels can now escape the other thing that this does when you eat a lot of sugar is that it actually creates a sodium retention not to mention the other mineral called potassium gets locked up in the sugar and wherever the sodium goes the water goes now over time this is going to affect the nerves and the bottom of the feet you tingling they call that periphal neuropathy and so yes when you look at a diabetic you see a lot of fluid in the ankles and things but even people that are not diabetic and maybe they even pre-diabetic they that area they also have fluid retention and that important vitamin to correct this but there are two other things they minerals that you need to also get from the diet of course the obvious one is potassium the problem with potassium is that it not easy to get from the diet because we need so so much an average person needs 4700 milligrams now think about what that means if you were to eat one banana that times does 300 go into 4700 let look you would have to consume 15.6 bananas every day just to get your potassium but the problem with that is that be hard and also that so instead of doing that you might be better off doing like avocados more salad and even more fruit like berries you can get a lot of potassium from that now the other mineral magnesium is behind something called ATP which is the energy currency of the body and yes you uh magnesium problems but also you going to have a lack of energy so to get magnes magesium you probably need to consume more pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds as well as leafy greens but you don about 420 Mig of magnesium you can also get both of these from a good electrolyte powder but just make sure that the electrolyte powder is high quality it doesn sugars all right so that will fix the pump but the very reason why the pump went bad is what we want to talk about next and that is a deficiency of vitamin B1 so I want to show you in this little uh very simple chart here I biochemical chart you can see all this chemistry stuff going on right here and this stuff right here when you eat sugar in the body it starts here and then it has to be broken down into a smaller sugar molecule called glucose and then it has to enter the machine to be turned into energy in order for it to go from this step to this step this one little enzyme requires vitamin B1 if you don have enough then you will not be able to use that as energy and so the number one cause of a B1 deficiency is consuming too much carbohydrates in the refined form for example if you eat all this refined sugar without B1 now the body has to pull from its reserves right we have to pull it from different tissues and organs and glands and eventually you is also very important as an antioxidant to protect the nerves this is why when you run out of B1 you get uh what called peripheral neuropathy which is tingling and numbness and burning on the bottom of your feet the point is that B1 is so important in carbohydrate metabolism and protecting you against a lot of carbohydrates and when I say protection I protection against this glycation this sugar connect ing to the protein B1 keeps these apart so you don have good circulation because you have to realize as soon as that connects to it it off so magnesium potassium and B1 is the solution to swollen ankles but you also have to get the sugar out of the diet because as soon as you go back to eating the refined carbohydrates guess what the swelling comes back all right so now the question is if I carbs what am I going to eat for that information you need to watch this video right here	Success
Fastest Way to Rid Your DOUBLE CHIN (Turkey Neck)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFE8qfwN23U	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now if you have a double chin or what they call a turkey neck where you have this loose skin you glad you watch this video their exercises SL stretches that if you do these on a routine basis you see massive Improvement here problem as we age gravity pulls down our tissues and there body that we develop a lot more loose skin especially underneath the neck through here people don part of the body at all you have a couple layers of fascia in your neck you have one just underneath the skin and then you also have one on top of your muscle so there deep layer and the cool thing about fascia which is connected tissue it has contracti tissue it tissue that is going to be permanently sagging but you have to activate it the muscles and fascia through this area are responsible for flexion okay so the head going forward okay as well as the chin coming down as in when you open your mouth and also taking the bottom of the mouth and then bringing it downward that here and there exercises you need to do and so just do these yourself along with the person that the first one is going to activate the muscles and faosa that pull the bottom part of your jaw downward you to be opening your mouth just like the person that exercise right now so go ahead and follow along as you do this 10 times so you jaw and and open your mouth as much as possible this is creating tension and tone underneath your chin again it probably been years since you activated this muscle and it area of the body what over time as you do these exercises it going to start to tighten the loose Skin to have a nice firmness underneath your chin okay so now let exercise with this exercise you probably don going to be basically taking the outer part of your mouth okay the corners of your mouth and bringing it outward and downward okay and so this facial expression this frown is going to activate slightly different muscles underneath your chin this is going to activate more of the superficial fascia just underneath the skin and it to focus more on the fascia right here versus lower in your neck okay let okay for this one you your head all the way back okay and then you upward as much as you can okay and you follow along as this is demonstrated in the video so we the neck okay we the fascia out we muscles then we step further and activate that last maneuver where we forward and getting that last very important stretch you have to realize that all this fascia is attached not just to your chin but it wraps over underneath the bottom part of your lip into your face so that interesting about fascia it covers a broad base area and this is why we have to take all the slack out and then create as much motion as we can to create this elongation okay so we now you with your head extended over the bed now what this is going to do it activate the flexion or the deeper muscles of the neck but actually we trying to activate the deeper fascia right superficially on top of those muscles to do that we have to create a flexion so we extension with the head back now we going to activate the muscles going forward so this is going to work this tissue and really put more blood supply into it and create more contraction and toning of the deeper fasha so go ahead and follow along as we do this exercise now some people will be very surprised when they do this how weak their neck is you just don area of the body very often so of course if you don all we attention on this missing piece of the puzzle which is the the stretching and the strengthening and the tightening of this fascia and after you do this for a period of time please comment down below and share with us the success that you had	Success
You Will Never Get High Blood Pressure after Watching This Video	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUu0vqcP7fE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you may never get high blood pressure after watching this video the most important thing to know about blood pressure is that it is a symptom it not a rot cause and in this video we going to talk about the root causes because the problem with hypertension is that 95% of it is classified as something called essential high blood pressure which basically means they don be caused by you know genetics or lifestyle we don weight and reduce your salt and you exercise and you stop smoking and you stop drinking it might go away there also a lot of people who don and they don and there consume a lot of salt and they don have high blood pressure and when someone is put on hypertensive medication 20% of the time it doesn work now why wouldn they fixing the cause anytime you treat the symptom without fixing the root cause you camouflage the problem it continues now if you have high blood pressure I not telling you to come off your medication without your doctor but I want to give you some really important information that will help you get to the root of this problem all right now let okay let vitamin D deficiency there is a hormone system called the water pressure control system when this system gets triggered and it goes up there is a potent vasal constriction going on in your arteries basically there arteries and the pressure is going to go up that is triggered by low vitamin D this system being being high also causes a massive retention of sodium wherever the sodium goes the water goes more sodium more water more pressure this is why there with high blood pressure off of sodium or on a low sodium diet they would be much better off giving the person vitamin D and also increasing their potassium the more potassium you have the more sodium you could have potassium protects you against the excess amount of sodium people that are salt sensitive are really potassium deficient and unfortunately the majority of population doesn you need so much you need like 40 700 milligrams every single day no one getting that much and also look at how many people are deficient in vitamin D it interesting point about this is that your risk of high blood pressure goes up during the winter why is that the way the sun is angled at the Earth there just not enough UV radiation to create enough vitamin D in our skin and then we have this other very important factor the darker your skin the more you risk for high blood pressure on average if you have dark skin your risk for high blood pressure goes up by 2x why does this happen because melanin in your skin is a pigment and it acts as a sunscreen it it blocks you of ultraviolet radiation making it very difficult to make vitamin D this is why the darker your skin the more vitamin D you need to take or the more sun exposure you need to have then you get into the genetic high blood pressure situation well that problem with vitamin D which is interesting there percentage of people that have a genetic problem with vitamin D that can vitamin D that well and they need a lot more vitamin D so I do we really have a genetic blood pressure problem or do we have a genetic problem with vitamin D that the high blood pressure I mentioned that 95% of all blood pressure problems are essential which means they cause so could be lifestyle it could be genetic they don all these lifestyle things in a box and you know we just don meantime keep taking medication because until we find out a cause we need to keep that pressure low then we have this insulin resistant connection if you consume a lot of carbs or you a lot of snacks you develop this condition called insulin resistance and this is a precursor for high blood glucose and it is the root cause of a fatty liver high blood pressure high cholesterol belly fat high glucose it all just insulin resistance if you low in vitamin D your risk for getting this goes high so that could be one mechanism why some people that are obese develop hypertension because the Obesity is diluting the vitamin D and either triggering insulin resistance or just causing high blood pressure directly vitamin D depends on magnesium magnesium is essential for vitamin D to work so these go hand in hand so this is why I put vitamin D magnesium and pottassium okay those three right there let at another connection between vitamin D and soft tissue calcium now you have this situation where if there calcium in the arteries your arteries can get stiff and actually your blood pressure can go up from there and if you watch some of my other videos I recommend taking vitamin K2 to direct the calcium into the bone or the teeth and out of the soft tissues and there actually even a test called the coronary artery calcification test which is a really good indicator or a predictor of all cause mortality this is why people with cramps at night or just leg cramps or feet cramps really they need more magnesium why magnesium prevents the calcium from building up in the tissues also think about women who are postmenopausal that take calcium supplements their risk for heart attack goes up why because you this calcium I mean some women are taking like 1,200 or500 milligrams of calcium every single day and sometimes they even take with vitamin D they heart problems why because they deficient in magnesium magnesium keeps the calcium from getting too high and forming clots that clotting or a thrombosis they call it could be coming from too much calcium also arrhythmias can also be coming from too much calcium and guess what magnesium is the antidote to preventing building up in the arteries heart attacks all sorts of things and let they use for high blood pressure calcium channel blockers which by the way magnesium is a natural calcium channel blocker but you can use a medication then you also have something else called beta blockers beta blockers block adrenaline okay so if there your blood pressure will go up as well and take a well guess what a natural beta blocker is not just magnesium but vitamin D both of these will naturally decrease adrenaline now let the four things I recommend to correct the problem if you have high blood pressure okay vitamin D I would take 10,000 IUS every single day but if you pressure take 20 ,000 or even a little bit more now if you have any thought in your mind that 20,000 I use is toxic being on the Sun for about 40 minutes will give you 20,000 IUS of vitamin D3 so 20,000 is not a toxic level in fact this is really like half of 1 milligram of vitamin D3 magnesium very underrated but it recommend taking magnesium glycinate you can get a good amount of magnesium from pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds spinach other Leafy grains almonds and even chocolate just make sure you don the chocolate with a lot of sugar magnesium allows vitamin D to work these two go hand in hand then I recommend going on a low carb diet because at the root of high blood pressure metabolic syndrome heart disease is too many carbs and consuming too much sugar and starch depletes you a vitamin D magnesium and potassium okay so you need to do that also potassium is very very important you can get this from an electrolyte powder I would recommend taking a high quality electrolyte powder that has about a th milligrams of potassium with other electrolytes but you can also get potassium from greens but you have to consume a very large salad every single day but the greens will also give you magnesium now to get more details on this low carb diet you should go to this video right here	Success
11 Bizarre Symptoms of Vitamin D Deficiency (You NEED to Know)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today I bizarre wild vitamin D deficiency symptoms now of course most people know the usual vitamin D symptoms lower back pain depression high blood pressure inflammation autoimmune diseases things like that but I will guarantee you do not know these now I this up in two sections the first part of this video is for the person who wants just Bare Bones information they don then the second part of the video I go into those people who want the science behind it the mechanism Behind these symptoms and like the underlying reason why they develop in the first place you have about 25,000 genes in your body and 10% of those genes are greatly influenced by vitamin D not to mention when you get your blood tests with vitamin D they the inactive vitamin D they showing you what cells and so the blood levels of vitamin D do not correlate very well with the vitamin D that are in your cells an active suppression of anything positive about vitamin D in the news in medical research because it directly competes with the top selling drugs I got up and presented this data to you know these were the top vitamin D researchers in the world all assembled there it was vicious the attacks of how Vitamin D doesn said I we have assembled you careers that have spent their whole career doing this stuff they never conceived that this could be true so let sweating now typically you in infants but you can also see it in teenagers adults but if you notice like a child or yourself sweating just more in the head suspect a vitamin D deficiency number two sweating more at night even if your temperature is cool now this can also show up with your pillow being moist in the morning so excess sweating especially at night is a vitamin D deficiency number three mood swings a person going from a condition or emotion of Happiness down to feeling irritable down to angry and then they get sad because vitamin D controls the regulation of your mood and it heavily influences emotions and this has a lot to do with how Vitamin D affects your brain but if you notice that yourself or loved one is just like roller coastering with these emotions could be a vitamin D deficiency number four procrastination being backlog and you just don mean it motivation is connected to a vitamin D deficiency all right number five panic attacks now in other videos I talk about panic attacks being a vitamin B1 deficiency and it can be but you also have a vitamin D connection to this as well a panic attack is a very severe fear or a very high anxiety condition and it definitely relates to certain hormones and neurotransmitters like serotonin but for those people out there that have panic attacks resort to drugs they might want to consider trying high doses of vitamin D3 I certain breathing techniques that a person can do as well like breathing through your nose and I will put that link down below but don D number six achiness in your pelvis in your lower back in your hips and your upper legs vitamin D is intimately connected with the formation of bone and One symptom of that is literally pain but not sharp pain this achiness that the inside of the bone because that where you inside it fix but you would have to take higher amounts not lower amounts I like 10,000 20,000 at least if you have any concern about 20,000 I use of vitamin D3 being toxic I just want to let you know that being out in the sun in the summer for 40 minutes will give you 20,000 iuse of vitamin D3 is that toxic no 20 100,000 IUS of vitamin D3 taken over months that into the Toxic effect not 20,000 IUS so then we have number seven which is loss of muscle strength vitamin D has a direct effect on calcium itself and without vitamin D calcium is going to be deficient in the muscle calcium allows the muscle to contract but not only contraction it production of muscle itself so without vitamin D and calcium you cannot create muscles and we also get this weakness with within muscles that control Power and strength primarily your legs and your shoulders and on top of that vitamin D also controls and regulates pain number eight stiffness and the stiffness usually occurs in the knees and in the fingers and of course this definitely relates to inflammation but it also has to do with What vitamin D does to your cartilage and your collagen so you might find that when you stretch backwards and create tension on the cartilage in your breast bone you might feel stiffness in that area as well and that can also affect breathing things like that number nine chronic fatigue this has a lot to do with those little energy factories in your cell they called mitochondria and how important vitamin D is to support that little Factory and if you don vitamin D you just can number 10 your ability to think quickly is to diminished basically you have too many applications open on your desktop computer but related to your brain and number 11 it satisfied when you eat a meal it could be that the food is just nutritionally empty and you keep eating to get these nutrients it can also be certain things in the food that cause you to be addicted but if you you you will definitely have a tendency to overeat so now that you know the general information let me just kind of give you another layer of of this data on each point which is actually very interesting okay number one was head sweating there head versus the rest of the body as far as certain sweat glands we have a lot more sweat glands in our head than other parts of our body it affects the autonomic nervous system causing this excess sweating in the head now this also relates to number two when we talked about night sweats but there something else going on with night sweats vitamin D suppresses an overactive immune system and just think about the immune system of all the things that happen one would be like a fever right that so when you and you have a slightly overreactive immune system this whole mechanism of sweating is controlled by this little tiny computer chip in your brain called the hypothalamus and when you have a vitamin D deficiency in this overreactive immune system it trigger excess sweating to compensate for this immune imbalance situation and one aspect of this is a fever your body is generating more heat and with that comes more sweat to compensate State all coming from a vitamin D deficiency all right number three is a mood swing okay now when we kind of come up and down on this emotional roller coaster you have your adrenals involved now the adrenal gland starting with the hypothalamus pituitary and adrenal is on this HPA axis this circuit thing going on but when you is going to go up now I don this is just because it you get rid of inflammation I don about that but with a vitamin deficiency you this cortisol pattern and if you have too much cortisol it going to put you more in a different emotional state let which is low motivation to do in the brain there is this little center it tiny little nerve bundle it fascinating it accumbent and this is the heart of a lot of things including addictions it kind of runs on dopamine and yes dopamine is involved in addictions but it neuro transmitter that motivation reward doing things getting things done that type of thing all right number five panic attacks a high level anxiety a very strong fear panic attacks from a physical standpoint in the body are related to that structure I talked about in the brain called the amydala that it needs vitamin D we have several things going on we have serotonin which is kind of like a a happy hormone and so vitamin D is is necessary to balance these two things all right number six achiness in the pelvis area in the lower back and the upper thigh muscle now this relates to a condition called osteomalacia now what is osteomalacia that that now think about this vitamin D deficiency is the number one cause of osteomalacia this is basically where the bones become very soft I I think this is going on in a massive scale in society right now but they have a subclinical version of osteomalacia I think I had it in high school because I was eating poorly and I I know I had a vitamin D deficiency and I I started getting fractures but the bones are soft certain proteins that are just not developing as well you have to realize that vitamin D you know controls calcium absorption by 20 times in the small intestine and in other videos I talk about the two systems of vitamin D you have the one controls calcium and the other system that is non-calcium yes you can check the vitamin D in the blood if you tested that chances are that pretty low it or less in which case you just need to start taking vitamin D3 and I would take a lot of it I would take at least 10,000 to 20,000 I use per day until you can get your levels a little bit higher for this bone problem you could probably get away with taking it sporadically like once a week if you want to do that but I wouldn problem so that number seven loss of muscle strength why because vitamin D controls calcium and calcium controls the contraction of the muscle if you you don can with that muscle pain that over it achy all right number eight is stiffness mainly in the knees and the finger joints because the cartilage needs vitamin D and it so it weightbearing joints on your knees could be the hips as well but also if you use the computer a lot or your fingers you this can definitely lead to osteoarthritis this is a lack of vitamin D vitamin D is essential for maintaining this cartilage and maintaining the ligaments and the tendons and think about this your ribs attached to the sternum with cartilage so you to notice it right through here too and so this is why stretching is so important to really keep this rib cage opened up because it contracted inflamed and pull you forward down here so you end up having bad posture and kind of a hunchback and not just take vitamin D but they need to do a lot of stretching to reverse that all right number nine chronic fatigue syndrome there for chronic fatigue syndrome one is that your vitamin D controls the number of mitochondri that are produced the mitochondria or the energy Factory so you it you mitochondria but the second reason for chronic fatigue syndrome is the immune connection if you are low in vitamin D certain viruses will come out of remission and be active these viruses especially the Epstein bar virus will start to come out of remission and be active one of the symptoms that they produce is fatigue so it have this full-blown infection now you get certain aspects of that infection like chronic fatigue nearly 100% of the people that have this reactivation of this Epstein bar virus or chronic fatigue syndrome it came after a severe loss loss of a loved one or a loss of a job or something like that but also it could be a vitamin D deficiency which by the way if you have vitamin D deficiency and you go through a loss boy that stress is going to hit you a lot harder you just need a lot of vitamin D I would take 50,000 I use a vitamin D3 every single day to pull yourself out of chronic fatigue syndrome all right number 10 mental sluggishness or slowness with decisions thinking focus is distracted vitamin D has a profound effect in the front part of the brain which kind of our relay system and even communication between one neuron and the next needs vitamin D3 and then we get to the last one feeling satisfied so letin tells the brain that you don work that well vitamin D helps make leptin work better then we also have insulin if you don D insulin doesn you all the nutrition to go into the cells so if you have insulin resistance because you not going to be satisfied so just by taking vitamin D insulin becomes more sensitive and you start getting more fuel to the cells you get more nutrients to the cells I hope this helped you to understand these bizarre unusual symptoms of vitamin D deficiency start taking vitamin D make sure you also take magnesium vitamin K2 zinc and B6 as the co-actors to prevent any issues and just to help it work better thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video	Success
I used to look like thisÂ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmCBAkmJ-rs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I want to show you something you see this book right here this is an Endocrinology book on page 84 we have this body type right here and you could see this round face I used to have this I mean my face was round it was swollen I had puffiness underneath my eyes I had no idea it was not normal until I got rid of it and then I that wasn show you exactly what this is and how to get rid of it pretty simply but this particular picture is in the chapter on a condition called Cushing syndrome and one of the symptoms is moon phas now Cushing syndrome is basically high levels of cortisol and cortisol is a stress hormone now with cortisol you have your body and if it of time that could be the problem or you synthetic version of cortisol it called prazone and in fact if you ever seen a picture of Jerry Lewis when he took prazone his face just swoll up like that and what I had prazone every single year for probably 10 years straight starting my 20s and my 30s from getting this darn poison ivy every year so whether that contributed to it or something else I not exactly 100% sure but I do want to share what I know on this topic now what cortisol has the power to redistribute where the fat goes in the body starts going around the face and in this part right here called the midsection so belly fat sometimes over time if you start getting that buffalo hump on the back there and also red cheeks thinner legs weak muscles in the legs especially the thigh muscle you start losing the glutamic Maximus the butt muscle right here other things that happen is your cholesterol and your lipids start going higher you start losing pottassium and retaining sodium so there goes your blood pressure is going to go straight up what vitamin D level goes down the immune system usually suffers and they tested cortisol levels and when people get emotionally upset the cortisol goes straight up in vertical so if someone is always or chronically emotionally upset they cortisol this next part is very interesting because the cortisol itself is not causing the face to to look like a moon face okay it it that hormone starts to break down your own proteins starting with your thigh muscles and your butt muscle and it turns that into glucose or sugar and that your body is making new sugar not out of the dietary sugar I mean this does not just happen in women it happens in men to you can see the adrenal glands are basically flooding the midsection with cortisol and then that turns into sugar and then fat so insulin is a fat storing hormone in the presence of just a little bit too much insulin you be able to lose fat and you go to the doctor and they might say well you just need to lose weight right lose weight go on a diet but stress can activate insulin people have high levels of insulin they get something called metabolic syndrome what is that that is a combination of high cholesterol hypertension and high blood glucose all of that comes from too much insulin ere exercising now I had this lady come in my office once and I had her do a little exercise and her pulse rate went up to 150 okay and then had her come back the next day the pulse rate was still at 150 I was like what the heck she her Rec recover y was terrible and that was a situation because typically in a healthy body you comes down so if someone like that with poor recovery would continue to exercise every day it would just create a tremendous amount of stress and cortisol in the body but also lack of sleep will raise your cortisol think about this when you don appetite goes up but boy when you get a good night hungry as much Cravings go away you doing great and then you have something like surgery and Trauma and being in pain can also increase cortisol not to mention alcohol and even certain medications all right so those are the triggers but now what about insulin what increases insulin carbohydrates this is a really big confusion with carbohydrates because when you do keto okay ketogenic diet this is basically you they will tell you to reduce your carbs below 50 g there with what a carb is a carb makes up several things one is fiber fiber is a carbohydrate sugar is a carbohydrate but if we take something like this right this is a poptart okay and we look at the the total carbs we have 78 carbs and then we have 42 sugars okay so a sugar is a carb and if we deduct the fiber and the sugar from the carb it leaves us with 34 additional G of something what is that something a lot of people don know what that is well that something is starch usually when you junk food you like this starch corn starch this is why it ingredients okay not just this other thing right here but the ingredients to see what you other things that can increase insulin that you need to know about frequent eating if you raising insulin but what if it carbohydrates doesn eating you a certain degree and so the frequency of eating is a killer seed oils soy corn canola cotton seed safflower sunflower seed those can actually really mess up your insulin as well these next few are very interesting nutrient deficiencies like a B1 deficiency magnesium deficiency and a vitamin D deficiency can all indirectly start elevating insulin because those are the key nutrients that allow insulin to work and when you problems with that hormone and of course the last one is medications especially by taking insulin they used to do what called insulin shock therapy wow insulin shock therapy what is that they would inject people with tremendous amounts of insulin put them in a coma wake them up a few weeks later as their therapy for mental illness and they would wake up fat incredible they used to do that okay so what do we do to to get the face back to normal okay because it your bones are round like that your face has layers of fat on it so the first thing to do is to start eating less frequently by cutting out the snacks between the meals that alone will be huge okay and then what you need to do is do intermittent fasting which is you number of meals I would recommend starting out with two meals a day and when you wake up in the morning try to go as long as you can before you eat the first meal okay and then maybe it 11:00 or even 12 have your first meal and then have your dinner now you two meals a day that because you to fast and when you forcing your body to reduce insulin and use your own fat as fuel because what we want to do is we want to force our body to use up the fat around our face which will come off first before the belly so it the face if you ever look at a diabetic that blood they their lower legs so when you do this you weight initially probably 11 lbs of water weight in the first week or two and then your weight loss is going to be down and you gosh I you have to get rid of the water first and then you which is a lot less you can pounds of fat per week the most it going to be two pounds but for most people it might be one pound a week so that number two you want to start changing the diet you want to start cutting down the carbs very specifically sugar and starches if you want a little card cutout that you can put in your wallet to show you what to avoid I link down below okay you just print it out cut it out put it in your wallet and now you can see what you should avoid number three increase your protein your body needs a certain amount of protein to really fix all these issues plant Source protein powders and all that stuff it doesn like a high quality meat protein and the highest quality meat that you could possibly eat is grass-fed it could be beef it could be lamb could be goat but grass-fed is what you want to do number four stress okay long walks every day your exercise program should be not too frequent if you intensity I would do also things like physical work because you mind off something versus walking at a treadmill reading your cell phone I really think the cell phone stresses people out more than anything so you got have to take part of the day and just put it to the side go for your walk without any cell phone anything because these cell phones give off EMF waves electromagnetic fields and that can raas cortisol and then the last thing and this is really important is try to get some extra sleep even if you wake up in the middle of the night go back to bed and try to sleep in a little bit that be so so important I used to really push it and think I can get away with it I get up at four now I sleep in more so I sleep I should have done that a long time ago I highly recommend it I know people have to get a lot of stuff done but the sleep will allow you to focus and it keeps you a lot healthier so lastly click the link down below to get that little card so you can cut it out and keep it in your wallet and it make things really easy	Success
This Can DESTROY Your Body	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you must know this so this presentation is an intriguing talk about viruses a virus is dead it destroy your body so let me just show you something this is a cell if we open up the cell it has a bunch of things in it okay you can see it has all these different they just little tiny parts of this huge Factory that makes stuff okay you have the mitochondria here which is the energy Factory you have the rib which is basically a protein factory and then you have the nucleus right in the center here well guess what viruses don in fact viruses are not even cells a virus is just some blueprints with the sack around it that has no energy no machine it cannot do anything outside your cell today we some potential theories on where viruses really came from it and viruses one hand can kill you but on the other hand they can actually really help you and I as well but to understand viruses you have to just get a little bit of a foundation of what they are and what they they the cell so they come in contact with a cell and it something gets inserted like a spike protein and it just activates something that then causes a chain reaction in your body which involves the hijack in of your Machinery so they basically can tap into your energy use your resources not theirs for their survival and then they start to reproduce and make more of themselves and then they explode your cell okay they classified as parasitic now before I get into some of the theories on where viruses came from which is a huge mystery I want to just cover some ways that these viruses evade your immune system there rupture the cell membrane they disintegrate it they viruses and then the other type of viruses are called latent viruses so they also destroy your cell but soon after the initial infection they invade your DNA and they go silent and then one day you get a little bit older and you go through stress and Bam they come out of remission and they become reactivated like herpes simplex like that little blister you get on your lip is one example HIV is another example Epstein by virus is another one so the problem with the latent viruses is they pretty much last a very long time in your body and they never go away and as long as you don poor health you might be okay but the litic viruses do their destruction and the immune system eventually takes care of them and wipes them out it wild that these viruses even exist in the first place where do they come from and why why are they here the first one is called the virus first hypothesis in this Theory the virus has been thought to come before even our cells existed another theory is called reduction theory in this Theory a virus is some type of remnants or residual something from some living cell so it ability to survive independently and so it must need another cell to tap into its energy then you get this other theory is called the giant virus and the fourth domain this really has challenged the traditional theory of viruses because a giant virus is a lot more complex and the theory goes that viruses are a fourth domain so you have different types of cells you have bacteria cells you have other cells it not really a cell it then you get this next theory that has to do with contribution to Evolution or having something evolve and this Theory goes like this you have this thing called horizontal Gene transfer it kind of like sharing knowledge key knowledge to help someone survive you can pass down Knowledge from you to your children in fact 8% of our genes have viral components then the last theory has to do with viruses being a necessary tool to help with survival now those are all the theories that are known there a couple other ones but I just want to add my two cents at this point what I think the purpose of viruses are for your immune system so in the immune system you have two types you have the type of immune system that you were born with it gave it to you but you also have another part of an immune system called the acquired immune system this is the part that you need to develop over time and you cannot develop it without viruses and they cause your immune system to adapt and become very very strong if you let this process happen so this is why I done videos on this where like with the child when they get sick and they have a fever the response is just to stop the fever and through a series of infections that immune system gets trained if we never let our immune system get trained it can never develop and become strong viruses have given us the evolutionary pressure to develop this robust immune system this could relate to just exercise right if you before how strong are you really going to be can you actually really build up this Fitness Reserve no not without exercise and so this side will develop strategies to help them survive and then our bodies will also develop other strategies so they waiting and waiting for the door to open for you to get weak now other viruses like the Epstein bar virus for example there the Epstein bar virus downgrades your vitamin D receptor because somehow it knows that vitamin D is really essential for your entire immune system so I just have to explain something about vitamin D that important a lot of people don about this in fact most doctors do not know that there for vitamin D and there different types of vitamin D you have vitamin D that comes from the Sun and then you also have the vitamin D that gets stored in the blood and then you have the last vitamin D which gets activated inside the receptors wherever it goes okay so there vitamin D one is all about calcium and Bone and the other system is about everything else okay it functions immune system is the big one the most important thing that you need to know is the vitamin D in the blood is in an inactive form and this is mainly to feed the bone a very tiny bit of it like 0.4% of it feeds the immune system so if you want a strong immune system but you either Sun or the supplement or vitamin D in from the food your immune system is going to suffer because the halflife is 24 hours for the bone you can get by with like 600 to 800 IUS but for the immune system you need a minimum amount of 10,000 IUS 10,000 IUS would be basically 20 minutes in the Sun but the average person needs 10,000 I use every single day to support a healthy immune system then you also have many viruses including the Rhino viruses which gives you the common cold they need zinc and your immune system needs zinc too because zinc also turns down virus reproduction and then you have another virus called HIV what that does is it Targets this very specific immune cell that is like the quarterback of the entire immune system and it takes that one out one way to counter that just as a side note is selenium selenium is in Brazil nuts it and if you have enough selenium you can reactivate that cell and get it to work right so now I want to just touch briefly on what reactivates certain viruses that are latent or in remission as you age you become weaker and also the more stress you have the more cortisol you have the weaker you going to become so cortisol suppresses your immune system in practice I notice a lot of people that had viral infections had them right after a severe stress and then other viruses can be reactivated through ultraviolet radiation the sunlight but the secret to this entire presentation is what can we do about viruses you have two specific types of immune cells that kill off viruses one is called the cytotoxic t- cell the other one is called the natural killer cell both of these can be greatly strengthened okay and I through a list of all the things that you can do vitamin D is hands down the most important nutrient for your immune system it it means that if your immune system is working too much or too slow or not enough it two is zinc I already talked about that zinc increases the immune system many different ways one way it counteracts this whole viral shutdown of your zinc Supply another way is zinc just stops the reproduction of viruses then of course you have vitamin C C right the best vitamin C food you can eat is raw sourkraut one cup of that a few times a week would give you 700 milligrams of Vitamin C sleep is another important thing try like heck to get 8 hours of sleep you know I was at one time bragging because I didn sleep you know I can get by I can get up really early that was a very stupid thing to brag about because I you seven eight hours of sleep is a necessity number five the reduction of stress whether it for a walk in nature doing stretches is very very important also if you have a fever don away why because fever Cooks the virus and so when you take some type of thing like an aspirin or whatever to try to get rid of the fever now you prolong the infection you don run through its training cycle of fighting off the infection but if your fever gets you know above 104 Fahrenheit which is 40° C at that point maybe you do something but not at lower temperatures number six garlic very important number seven Elderberry awesome for viruses intermittent fasting very powerful also magnesium helps increase the killer tea cells I recently stumbled on information so one way to strengthen the immune system is to take about 800 milligrams in the evening before you go to bed Believe It or Not laughter can also increase these killer tea cells viruses outside your cells are powerless they can just float around they have no energy no mechanics so this is why it to understand that you need to go through infections to build up your immune system and you need the key nutrition to support and strengthen the immune system itself versus the other Viewpoint which is not true where you have a virus that is alive which is not true and it stronger than your body it goes into your body and at all cost you just need to suppress and try to kill it off there ends up weakening your immune system so remember this concept and apply it to your lifestyle	Success
The 7 Warning Signs of a Zinc Deficiency	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUmXIXsMi0g	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today I want to discuss the seven warning signs of a zinc deficiency that has the potential to make your life a living hell now we through all of these but I will say number seven is the most deadly and it the most common the reason I video on zinc is because zinc is the third most important nutrient number one being vitamin D why because vitamin D is involved in 2500 genes number two is magnesium why because it 300 different enzymes and zinc is number three because it 200 different enzymes that biochemistry zinc allows you to make glutathion which is the most powerful antioxidant zinc is highly concentrated in your prostate it helps you make sperm and testosterone zinc is also in your pancreas the specific part that makes insulin zinc is even in your brain in a very specific part that is like a relay switch to your memories it hippocampus so when your hippocampus goes down you get dementia then you also have zinc decreasing gastritis helping you make collagen and even helping you grow your hair but now let that can make your life a living hell night blindness is one big indication of a zinc deficiency and if you drove at night when it you can dangerous all right number two low testosterone in fact you can even get something called hypogonadism where your testicles are shrunk now if you to notice your estrogen and progesterone are going to be excessively low and if you you need those hormones to be a lot higher and if they be a living hell as far as cortisol goes what happens the cortisol goes down because someone then that sends a signal back up to the brain and then the brain causes the adrenal glands to overcompensate so then you make more cortisol because you don have enough think so guess what you going to have more stress all right that was number two number three is diarrhea and if you your life will be a living hell a lot of children who consume a lot of cereal and grains in poor countries develop diarrhea because of a zinc deficiency because these grains have something called phytic acid that blocks the absorption of zinc number four is acne I had really bad acne in high school and that was very unfortunate because it really affected my self-esteem I had one interest in high school that was girls but I had acne so that was a big barrier no confidence your skin is highly influenced by zinc number five is alopecia you actually lose hair if you combine acne with hair loss that would be a life of living hell zinc is so important in helping the growth of the root of the hair also making the hair thick and also to support the elasticity of the entire hair all right number six is the need for cataract surgery because a lack of zinc can cause cataracts which is terrible because your lens of your eye starts becoming opaque and you just can like white so personally I don cerax and number two I don surgery on my eyes all right now comes number seven so you might want to be sitting down for this one because this one is extremely important maybe you not ready for this maybe I should cover this in the next video no I what it is the thymus gland which is the master immune gland which sits on top of the heart shrinks but what is it starts shrinking right after puberty check this out you have a very healthy thymus gland right you have all that gland right there and then at age 25 it the rest of this is just fat and then look at at 50 years old significantly less thymus Clan thus less immune system and then at 70 you just have traces of this thymus gland so you have maybe just a little bit of residue left to be able to fight infections the thymus is the most important immune gland it makes te- cells now I of te- cells but the letter T stands for thymus because they originate from the thymus gland and these te- cells control and coordinate every aspect of your immune system if you instantly just take an antibiotic for every infection in an aspirin to reduce the fever you weaken the immune system I would just let it go through its cycle I wouldn suppress it if it gets over 104 okay good check with your doctor but that fever really is part of your immune defenses and it viruses and bacteria but the tea cells are not just about infection they also about killing cancer and preventing autoimmune diseases so if there cells they are not able to differentiate in other words they the difference between your cell and a bad guy or a pathog then your immune system kills them gets rid of them cuz we don self attack and that autoimmune diseases a researcher Professor Greg Fay who has some mind-blowing research I want to share with you his whole thing is about anti-aging and he basically all of his work is designed to help restore and regenerate this atrophy thymus gland so if you can actually regenerate the thymus gland you can literally increase lifespan because you decrease the risk of getting cancer and infections so in his study he gave patients growth hormone also metformin and DHEA to prevent the side effect of growth hormone which is diabetes the growth hormone actually stimulated the growth of the thymus and a 20% increase in V2 Max I mean V2 Max is your maximum lung capacity your ability to use oxygen which a high level usually relates to an athlete but the subjects that went through his program didn extra exercise he was one of the first people to reverse this biological clock so this is fascinating information I was really excited about it I started to look into the research on animal studies and I found some additional information I want to share with you in this one study a rat study they transplanted a thymus from a younger rat into this older rat and there was remarkable regeneration and aging it was just quite mind-blowing the rat lived a lot longer with regrowth of the organ okay now I want to show you two amazing studies involving giving zinc to mice a full recovery of the thymus function with regrowing of the organ and a partial Improvement in the immune system as measured by natural killer cells so we cells that basically kill viruses and they kill cancer let me just quickly cover what causes a zinc deficiency number one getting older number two having gut issues number three not consuming animal products alcohol sugar chronic stress and certain medications zinc also has to be balanced out with copper and anytime you take zinc I recommend taking also with Copper at a ratio of 10 to one 10 times as much zinc is copper I would recommend one more thing and that would be a thymus extract but when I buy supplements I do look at reviews and it People are improving their histamine level levels decreasing allergies some people claim that their hair is getting darker because in the study that Dr Greg Fay did he also found a smaller group of people started noticing darker hair you don of your thymus gland you want to extend it as long as possible and even though studies were done in mice you know it it might help humans as well no claims here you no guarantees and if you want a little bit more information about zinc you should check out this additional video I have which is fascinating	Success

I Will Get Attacked for This...	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiU1B6VNDvQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you recently invited to speak at the low carb conference okay there was a bunch of doctors in the room and what was amazing was that all the doctors in the room practiced a completely different type of medicine they practice the philosophy that food is the best medicine using drugs were not their mode of treatment and I really think that going to be the way of the future but unfortunately the great majority of doctors use drugs to heal people and today we about quite a few lies that you probably have been told by your doctor and the problem is not even doctors it system behind doctors if you were just to ask someone in the medical profession what creates Health what would they say does a drug actually create health or does it numb or alter a symptom and unfortunately our current health care system is highly influenced by big Pharma and big food aka the junk food industry another problem with the medical profession is it specialized we have a bunch of Specialists that are not necessarily connecting the dots and looking at the whole body doctors just focusing on the ears nose and throat other doctors just focus on the digestive system or the endocrine system or the brain I think that keeps everything separated and very unfortunately the training in nutrition and food therapy is virtually absent in medical school they get I think 12 to 20 hours well here biochemistry textbooks this one right here and what book are the key co-actors AKA nutrients that are involved in Biochemistry nutrition is not emphasized in Biochemistry doctors do not look into this diet this food angle yet many doctors have opinions on nutrition which is not very favorable so let the nine lies that your doctor told you number one you don so if you deal well first of all the gallbladder is a sack that is underneath your right rib cage it something called bio salts and bio salts are a detergent that helps you extract certain fats from your digestive system so without a gallbladder you going to be able to concentrate this bile so if you don bile salts after a meal would be a good idea number two statins have minimal side effects that is completely not true they have major side effects not just a little problem with muscles but a major problem with muscles your risk for typee 2 diabetes goes up and you for liver damage some doctors even recommend statins for everyone over the age of 40 and 50 whether you have a problem with cholesterol or not that is insane because without cholesterol a lot of problems can occur cholesterol is a necessary thing that your body makes and needs for several things number one it needed to make a lot of different hormones including testosterone estrogen progesterone the stress hormone called cortisol it membranes and you have a lot of cell membranes in fact the surface area of membrane that surrounds your cells is roughly and I 90 Acres so instead of trying to block the production of cholesterol let actually get rid of certain things that are causing high levels of cholesterol another lie that people are told is that hypertension is really too much salt in the diet is it really the salt some people that take salt before bed sleep better because it lowers cortisol we don the threshold instead we want to take the opposing mineral which is potassium and increase that that allows a person to tolerate more sodium salt sensitive people are no longer salt sensitive when they have more potassium potassium is great for blood pressure because it helps soften the arteries it helps calm this tightness down all right the next one the doctor says your vitamin D is low we right which is a ridiculous number it so small it dent into your levels so then you go back to the doctor because you probably found one of my videos that said you should take a minimum of 10,000 iuse every day as a maintenance dosage and they tell you oh my gosh that that minutes in summer you of vitamin D3 have you ever heard being out the Sun for 20 minutes will give you some toxicity with vitamin D no you don the most natural way to get all the benefits what you have to know is the international units are not a measurement of weight or size they based on a group of people deciding that of vitamin D3 is not that much if I not mistaken it one milligram of vitamin D3 now this next one is actually kind of comical you that you need to give up red meat because red meat causes colon cancer causes heart disease right really is that actually true the answer is no in fact out of all of the foods that you can eat that can help heal you grass-fed red meat is at the top of the list why because it provides the most quality protein that your body needs number one it has virtually all of the B vitamins zinc selenium copper iron all in the form that another thing called creatine which gives you energy and it helps your muscles it has ELC carnitine which helps deliver fats into the mitochondria for energy it helps you burn fat it even has something called co-enzyme Q10 and it one of the best sources of glutamine for any type of gut inflammation but of course the conventional healthcare industry says that red meat is bad and you should avoid it they kind of lump it in with processed meat meat saying it all the same next one is that you have to avoid saturated fats well they blame the saturated fat when in fact they should be blaming the unsaturated fat the seed oils which make up 30% of our diet saturated fat by itself is not the culprate if you take a look at all the junk food out there there saturated fat in junk food I about the breads pasta cereal crackers biscuits waffles pancakes very inflammatory this next one is interesting they you to lose weight because the weight the cause no weight is a symptom your high cholesterol is a symptom you see if you actually put weight as the cause of your problem then you susceptible to taking certain measures that might not be healthy to lose weight like OIC or some other medication my question is what is really at the root of your weight problem it circular because they weight problem causes your high blood pressure and they might put you in this boat where you have metabolic syndrome so you have all these different syndromes they each other but no one about the root cause the root cause is really something called insulin resistance where the body is pumping out a lot of insulin and that insulin is making you fat it constrict causing blood pressure to go up and that refined carbs and sugars and Seed oils so My Philosophy is always it weight to get healthy it first to lose the weight so focus on the health the next one relates to maybe a recommendation you might get from a dietitian and this would be you need to be more plant-based right because plant-base is cleaner if you take a look at some of the ingredients on these plant-based artificial fake Meats it all alra processed food ingredients we we it organic free range pasture raised eggs much healthier and this next one is really fascinating because they that hypoglycemia is a complication of diabetes and so we have to manage it because it having diabetes is to have hypoglycemia well what is Hypoglycemia low blood sugar what is diabetes high blood sugar so if diabetes is high blood sugar shouldn and carbohydrates wouldn best thing to do well guess what doctors don they tell you to keep some glucose pills in your pocket or candy in case you blood sugars go too low because the medication you your blood glucose we don go too low that why doesn lower the medication and take less candy because it Spike the insulin that drops the blood glucose so anyone who has hypoglycemia or low blood sugar really has too much insulin and thus the problem with the medical industry there hasn Deep dive and evaluation into you know nutrients and what they do and how they can benefit someone but what I will say is I have done a deep dive on many different aspects of nutrition if you want more information on that you should check out this video right here	Success
14 Bad Habits That Can Destroy Your Heart	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBElcAs6H0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we bad habits that can potentially ruin your heart let believing everything you read on labels let corn oil how can this be heart healthy what in here helps your heart this is industrial processed seed oil that has been highly refined and apparently this stays in the shelf for a long time do you realize that an average person consumes eight of these every year that calories this is a gallon and this is supposed to be healthy for our heart here your heart instant oatmeal you talking a lot of sugar in here and it said heart healthy and here we have another one honey and nut Cheerios just different combinations of ingredients including sugar I like this Grandma makes my heart happy that marketing both seed oils and these whole grains are high in Omega 6 and Omega 6 is pro-inflammatory it creates inflammation and on top of that they going to add all this extra sugar and refine starches I highly doubt it going to lower your cholesterol in fact it may just increase your cholesterol but I think you should personally just consume it and then retest your cholesterol and see what it really does all right number two stay out of the sun use suntan lotion Sun can cause cancer stay away from it well this is going to reduce our vitamin D thereby increasing our risk for heart attacks by roughly 32% based on a study that I put down below in fact one of the best remedies for high blood pressure is vitamin D so avoiding the sun is not a good idea let excessive sitting or a sedentary lifestyle there that shows an increased risk of heart disease by 147% and not only heart attacks but Strokes as well now if we compare sedentary people versus people that exercise sedentary people have an increased risk of dying from a heart attack by over 50% exercise improves your Fitness that that extra resource to help you cope with stress and live longer number four the overuse of certain medications sometimes we normalize medications it normal to be on medications over the age of 50 we don effects as much because everyone medication and your doctor told you to take medication so it must be fine but even over-the-counter medications can increase your risk of getting heart attacks by over 50% I mean there many medications that stress the heart chemotherapy will definitely increase the risk of eting a heart attack and especially HRT hormone placement therapy can increase the risk of getting Heart Attack by 29% so work with a doctor that of remedies for various conditions number five snacks especially the late night snacks especially if they carbohydrate snacks I used to do this on a regular basis I loved chips I would do ice cream and that snack before bed ruined your ability to burn any fat through the night you burn most the fat when you anything but that doesn eat something before you go to bed especially if it hormone spikes mostly at night so growth hormone is the anti-aging hormone it helps burn fat and it when you eat these carbs before bed unfortunately so don between the meals and especially after dinner number six drinking a lot of water but also at the same time being on a low salt diet what you you electrolyte called sodium what might happen is you might develop a condition called hypo nutria which is low sodium in the blood hypon neuta actually can cause a heart attack swelling in the brain and all sorts of side effects all the water is going to create a lot of pressure on the kidneys in the heart because your body has to get rid of the water and then you end up being dehydrated because you don salt to retain that fluid the thing to do if you necessarily decrease sodium but to increase pottassium potassium will protect you against any dangers of sodium all right number seven ignoring Dental Care believe it or not in certain studies where they dissect the plaque in the arteries they have found in that plaque Dental bacteria now what is this bacteria from your mouth doing in your arteries well there called gum disease we can develop infections underneath the teeth especially if you had a root canal and there there and then that can leak into the lymphatic system get into the blood supply and it can circulate throughout the body the last thing you want to do is is create an infection underneath the tooth that identify these infections underneath the teeth can actually eat up your bone and you have to do a special a 3D x-ray to identify necrosis of the bone all coming from an infection number eight mouth breathing it talking mainly when you should really practice breathing through your nose now why is this so important there called the bore phenomena where you breathing in oxygen okay but that oxygen that goes into the red blood cell cannot be released unless you have a certain amount of CO2 so this is why when you hyperventilate and you get all this oxygen and you go into a panic attack breathe into a paper bag why so you can get more CO2 to allow the oxygen to go into the tissues so by nose breathing you feel like you you you breathe through your nose because you this little tape that you can put on your mouth that breathing can greatly enhance your ability to sleep it can help as sleep apnea it can also help with snoring number n microplastics now you can be exposed to a lot of microplastics from many different sources consuming water and plastic bottles that are especially heated plastic chemicals on the inside of certain cans they an average person has a lot of these microplastics very tiny pieces of plastic in their blood where is all this plastic coming from well it our fluid Supply because a lot of the Plastics get into the soil there of microplastics in the ocean but a lot of these Plastics don unfortunately number 10 feeling out of breath very easily when you start to exercise let exercising for a while and you exerting yourself and you get out of breath super easy you have an intolerance for exercise this is a classic sign of congestive heart failure there that you need to evaluate don that all right number 11 jet leg which greatly affects your sleep cycles also a lot of people when they fly their ankles or their body starts filling up with fluid so they start getting fluid retention and they get this huge expansion on their feet and so if you do fly frequently what you should do is you should be taking nasin nasin helps to support the mitochondria it important nutrient it would recommend taking about 250 milligrams every day at least make sure you take the one that creates the flushing sometimes you have to start with a smaller amount and gradually increase it another thing to take with jet leg is higher doses of vitamin D3 about 20,000 IUS of vitamin D3 before you started flying you would find the jet leg being a lot less because vitamin D3 helps to readjust the Circadian rhythm regulation number 12 excessive cardio without enough rest when you exercise a type of exercise that really hard on the body is this sustained postrate exercise you are just bringing the Pate up and you sustaining it over a period of time the point is that it can create extra stress on the heart this is why you see a lot of these Runners who look like they in shape they have problems in their arteries and so if you are a runner it called a CAC test it stands for coronary artery calcification score it expensive it predicting your overall mortality number 13 secondhand smoke but secondhand smoke can also be a problem because you usually you know you don in your mouth you that can actually increase your risk of getting Heart Attack by 25 to 30% and this is probably because it decreases oxygen into the body not to mention all the chemicals there 7,000 different chemicals when you smoke and 70 of them are carcinogenic so avoid secondhand smoke and and also firsthand smoke number 14 refined Foods out of all the nutrients that are super important for the heart magnesium is at the top of the list because number one most people are not getting enough magnesium from their diet and they that are depleting magnesium and it virtually impossible the test accurately your magnesium levels you can the blood test like 99% of your magnesium is not in the blood most of it is inside the cell magnesium is involved in 300 different enzymes especially in helping you sleep lowering your risk for cramping as well as decreasing your risk for arrhythmias and also preventing calcium building up in the heart one really simple way to lower blood pressure is to take not just vitamin D3 but magnesium with it good habits you should also add to this cold showers or even cold immersion produces so many positive changes watching comedies laughing more all of these things are super important in lowering stress and improving sleep now since we topic of cardiovascular function if you have not seen this video on heart health you

The BEST Fibroid Shrinking Vitamin (based on science)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZI8qJjN2Qw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you know when I heard this statistic up to 80% of all women develop some type of fibroid by age 40 mind-blowing like why that is so weird and the last thing that a woman wants is a hysterctomy with all the side effects not to mention a fibroid so I pulled a string and I found something fascinating I want to share with you let about fibroids number one they actually decrease after menopause that interesting so why would that be well it we goes through pregnancy or is exposed to HRT or birth control pills there can be an enlargement of the fibroid which sounds like it estrogen then we have the relationship between obesity type 2 diabetes high blood pressure and polycystic ovarian syndrome all increasing the risk of fibroids why is it that black women are 3 to nine times more at risk for getting fibroids and of course the common theme with this is estrogen estrogen is a growth hormone it fibroids and endometriosis all right let tissue what is a uterus it and so the difference between the fibroid and uterus is a fibroid is a growth from the uterus and so it grows out of the uterus tissue in a fibroid it collagen in a fibroid that hard but there differences between a fibroid and the uterus in a fibroid you have a much greater sensitivity for estrogen which means that a fibroid is very sensitive to estrogen okay it can grow a lot faster with estrogen than the actual uterus and a fibroid has more receptors for estrogen there enzyme called aromatase going on in a fibroid now what enzyme that converts androgens which is more for men to estrogen the environment in this fibroid has a lot less oxygen than the uterus that we what has a lot more inflammation than the uterus so here all of these Clues have in common so there throughout all these Clues and that is a low vitamin D situation now regarding research in this area which I cover in a little bit there reviews on Research with vitamin D and I really think that has to do with the frequency and the amount of vitamin D that they give people in certain studies the amount of vitamin D needs to be a lot greater than the usual vitamin D that the studies are operating off of this old outdated information that we need a very small amount of vitamin D like 600 to 800 IUS and all that research is mainly for bone own skeletal calcium and not the immune system the uterus the prostate the skin the brain the muscles this is a completely other system that needs a lot more vitamin D vitamin D will inhibit the growth of fibroids number two vitamin D also helps regulate other growth factors as well and since we really dealing with something that of control as far as the growth vitamin D also is a aromatase inhibitor it blocks that enzyme preventing excess amount of estrogen vitamin D increases apoptosis which causes the fibroid cells to commit suicide preventing the growth of a fibroid but vitamin D also is anti-inflammatory anytime we have inflammation we can have a growth of a tumor or even cancer well guess what vitamin D is the most potent anti-inflammatory someone can take this is also interesting vitamin D doesn seem to work in an environment where there environment now the very nature of a fibroid it hypoxia because it irregular collagen and things like that so this could explain why normal amounts of vitamin D won dealing or penetrating this fibroid in doing anything you have to use much higher amounts vitamin D downgrades estrogen there are two different receptors for estrogen one estrogen receptor increases t tumor growth the other one called estrogen receptor beta decreases or shrinks the cells that actually are turning into a tumor well guess what vitamin D supports this one that helps shrink it and inhibits the other one that is making it grow which is very cool and also vitamin D helps to increase the certain hormone in the liver to help lower the amount of free estrogen that if we look at this whole situation estrogen is the primary driver but we don the vitamin D simply because the majority of the population is deficient in vitamin D especially black people and black women why because of the melanin in the skin blocks vitamin D and so here we have this population which is already low in vitamin D and then they actually have these spikes of estrogen they going to get more fibroids than people that have enough vitamin D now let take a look at obesity for example obese people are always deficient in vitamin D because vitamin D gets diluted into the fat cells so an overweight person needs a lot more vitamin D because it gets diluted and it far as type 2 diabetes there low vitamin D high blood pressure I think the majority of that is low vitamin D that blood pressure because if you give a person more vitamin D their blood pressure goes down and then of course you have polycystic ovarian syndrome that much insulin now this is very interesting information because because it provides a solution to a very common condition that occurs with up to 80% of all women but I do not think you can create a dent into this problem unless you take enough vitamin D and I to get into this but I first want to just talk about a few studies involved and also some anecdotal case studies that I want to share with you next so the question is is there research on vitamin D shrinking fibroids well it bit mixed but I want to show you why it some of the positive results right now there was a study in 20133 in reproductive science that showed a significant decrease in the size of fibroids within 12 weeks taking 25,000 IUS of vitamin D3 once a week now if they took that every day I think the results would be even better here another study in 2014 on African-American women and these women had low vitamin D in their blood they found a high percentage of women with fibroids have a lower vitamin D level than those that had a higher level of vitamin D in their blood they gave them 50,000 IUS of vitamin D3 every two weeks and then in 10 weeks they saw a significant decrease in the fibroid size and I those results because taking it every two weeks is just not going to be sufficient you want to take it every single day here vantini these are women who took vitamin D and they found the group that took the vitamin D did not experience any fibroid growth versus the other group who didn take vitamin D had a 40% increase in fibroid growth in vitamin D3 doctors even discourage women from taking 10,000 or 20,000 or even 50,000 vitamin D every day because somehow it said I was taking 50,000 IU when I said that he sheet he says that can 50,000 IU you know that no it say yet the research shows that you have to take hundreds of thousands of vitamin D3 for months to create any toxicity and really the only toxicity is excess calcium in the blood causing kidney stones but you can even greatly minimize that side effect by taking magnesium vitamin K2 drinking a little more water 2 and2 lers of water a day those are all the co-actors that will minimize that Toxic effect which personally I think that if you 50,000 I used or less you that range of having any toxicity now there going to recommend Down Below on using high doses of vitamin D3 and this particular author his name is Jeff BS has a website and you can search on his website now these are anecdotal they not based in any studies but it listening to here fibroid tumor and the doctors recommended surgery to remove my entire uterus well guess what after remaining on a high dosage of vitamin D3 with the proper K2 magnesium zinc and calcium balance and of course changing my diet my last MRI showed that the tumor is now in a necrosis status what doctor at Emory in Atlanta dropped me because I refuse to have the surgery let am a 50-year-old RN and a patient medical Advocate with the vitamin D levels of 30 nanog per Miller I didn know what a difference having a high vitamin D level would do from me until now I and felt a slight positive difference but when I added the K2 and did the higher dosage of 50,000 IUS per day for one month I stabilized at 25,000 IUS and continue to feel the benefits after 2 years cured fibroid uterine tumors in early 2014 and I continue to experience no aches and pains I keep my blood level at 150 which is high normal I said you know look at me I numbers are even better than they were before right he says well I don so I think there just I think we have to look at this again I said look the fibroid is gone I don need to remove my you know my womb I don need to start telling your patients about this stuff why don about vitamin D actually there out there so the other thing we facing is what they don know about they love evidence-based medicine and they said well doctor you believe in evidence-based medicine and I said well yeah but the problem is you can being censored or you put it behind a pay Wall go down some rabbit hole of Science and you and you finally get to the where the meat of the matter is Boom it behind a payall unless I buy a $100 for every article or whatever I can so I really think there seriously consider taking more vitamin D as well as the co-actors to potentially do some positive things about shrinking fibroids but I think with a lot of things in the news with scares about vitamin D it the details especially with the scare of a toxic level of vitamin D and if you haven vitamin D that I think exaggerated the toxicity levels you should check out this video

THIS Increases Heart Attack Risk over 2000%	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZKgshcwi4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	[Music] this can increase the risk of a heart attack over 2,000% within the first 24 hours now you probably wondering what am I talking about what increases the risk of heart attacks by that much could it be bad diet Noe could it be smoking no what about alcohol no this trigger that I the risk of getting viral infections and autoimmune diseases so what is this trigger it type of stress that inrees heart attacks the most is losses a loss of a significant person in your life and they actually have a name for it it a broken heart syndrome what they found was that when you go through a loss your risk for heart attack within the first 24 hours goes up significantly within the first week your risk for heart attacks are 6X so this got me thinking into other types of stresses like post-traumatic stress disorder and the risk of developing autoimmune diseases by 46% and I of stress that people have nowadays is actually manufactured stress can be physical it could be mental it can be real or imagined even thinking about a stressful State can affect your body physically you environment but just thinking about it your blood pressure will start to increase when I first met my wife we went to this fair and they had a roller coaster she loves roller coasters she thrives on roller coasters she can do the most intense roller coaster that you can possibly imagine I can small baby ones right I course I didn so I got on the roller coaster with her and I remember getting into the cart and they put this thing over you and they lock you in my pulse rate started beating boom boom boom and as we going up this slow Hill and I see on the other end it pressure my adrenaline starts kicking in more and more and I started holding on really really tight to the point I was shaking my wife going oh my gosh what what here and I was literally in pure Terror we get up to the top you can where you said your face was white as a ghost what that means when your face is that pale is you all the blood is in the bottom of your feet so as we went over the roller coaster going down I think I passed out I mean there was like tears coming down from my eye my wife says I will will never do that again I will never force you to get on the roller coaster and I coaster ever since that I also had a severe fear of public speaking devastating there stresses that people actually can tolerate other people can two main types of stress there type of stress that and then there happens over a period of time but both of them can create similar problems and what happens when you actually experience stress you have two things going on you have a higher level of adrenaline which then activates something else called cortisol so cortisol is a hormone adrenaline is a neurotransmitter adrenaline works very quickly cortisol takes some time it starts mobilizing the sugar for quick energy whereas adrenaline mainly works on the heart rate sweating blood pressure and also constriction of blood in certain places because we need to put the blood into the heart and the lungs and this is why even when someone has a heart attack right when their arteries are clamping down they can inject the heart with adrenaline and it vasodilator it opens it up the same thing with someone having an asthma attack they and that will vasod dilate the lungs but what happens in chronic stress is you start getting this high level of cortisol cortisol is a natural suppressant of your immune system and this leaves you wide open for getting infections because you just now lost the barrier this is why stress lowers your defenses and allows the virus to invade the body this is also why so many people develop autoimmune diseases after a stress event especially if the stress is intense enough or a shock to the system where literally you just shut down a part of the immune system that is supposed to keep these autoimmune diseases in check especially a specific cell called the T regory cell those cells are kind of like the Peacekeeper and they tend to keep the body from developing this self attack it an autoimmune attack from your own immune system destroying your own body cells so that explains why stress really can activate so many problems with the immune system and of course with heart attack and stroke we what you have to realize is stress activates adrenaline which activates clotting and other problems related to the cardiov muscular system like I said before you don to have real stress in front of you it can be you running through all sorts of scenarios but some things can get overwhelming and they can shock our body and I talk about some great solutions for that as well without getting into the details of that generally I think you know what I people or groups that are basically making your environment more dangerous or at least perceived to be dangerous creating a real or fake emergency exaggerating a crisis all of these things are meant to put people in fear because usually the group that creating that problem has a solution that now you and really the key word in this whole thing is control there bad stress and it all really has to do with who because there are certain stresses that are very therapeutic to us right like exercise we sometimes we think that if we can just get rid of all of our stress and our problems we that high-intensity interval training I mean that actually increases stress it increases adrenaline it increases cortisol but you very short period of time another stress that climbing now that straight up in vertical you Heights and when I climb my attention is totally in the present on the next thing I thinking about any problems in my mind they are gone within the first few minutes because I am more focused on something else so it do with your attention because the therapeutic goal should be to get you out of your head and to take your attention and unfix it to what you focused on and push it to something else sports that it attention off your problems when you doing sports another thing to do is work with wood very therapeutic cleaning gardening dancing music art and physical manual work around your house all of that is super therapeutic for stress if you breathe in a certain way this is a way to control your own autonomic nervous system and it works like a charm and what you do is you breathe through your nose not your mouth as you breathe in in and you breathe out this is a great technique to pull you out of a panic attack or in an anxiety attack but again it that and also taking certain nutritional things like an adaptogen ashwagandha is one of the better ones ashwagandha helps increase your tolerance to stress it calms the nerves B1 you can get also a nutritional yeast and then magnesium is another one that I use as well especially in the evening before I go to sleep winds you down it helps in many different ways related to stress and cortisol but there can do that I used to do this in practice and now I do videos on how to do it yourself and you can manually do some acur pressure to certain points in your body that will greatly reduce your stress it will literally put you to sleep when you do it it for that information you can check it out right here	Success
I Was Shocked When I Learned About This	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL1mN0uBFw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I was actually shocked to learn about these forever chemicals I did a deep dive in this topic and I want to give you a summary of it another name for these are past chemicals and the reason they call them forever chemicals is they stay in the environment for thousands of years they basically slowly poison us 97% of Americans were tested positive for these pasos chemicals they fat cells they breast milk and especially drinking water these chemicals are definitely linked to cancer hormone problems especially the thyroids liver damage reproductive damage however despite how depressing this topic is I have a really good solution these past chemicals are all over the place you these chemicals using Teflon cookware food packaging firefighters are exposed to it from the foam that they spray it in a lot of canning Goods unfortunately it were first introduced into our environment in the early 50s or even late 40s and of course you would think there to allow these chemicals in our environment by either the EPA or the FDA but it these governmental agencies are are doing anything about it but my first question was why were some of these chemicals considered generally recognized as safe well now I know that that manufacturer companies use to push their chemicals into the environment by doing their own safety studies and then considering it safe I mean even the testing methods that the FDA use right now it compounds yet there compounds of course the EPA the Environmental Protection Agency only tests for a fraction of the chemicals compared to all of the chemicals that are out there I mean it wasn the 2020 that the FDA began to phase out voluntary agreement with manufacturing companies to stop using these posos chemicals in food packaging but they have yet to enforce these bans but of course they farmers with their raw milk apparently that chemicals so the two strategies that I going to recommend is to limit the exposure to these chemicals and so the greatest exposure right now is from your water supply so I want to talk a little bit about that the second strategy which I think is a really good strategy would be to build up your own body for these chemicals but first let talk about this water thing there some great research by the environmental working group ewg on forever chemicals and what they did is they evaluated 25 posos chemicals to see at what percentage these water filters were getting rid of these posos forever chemicals and they tested quite a few but there actually work by removing 100% of these chemicals and those are the three that I is called the travel berky gravity this one cost around $327 so it expensive the next one is is called clearly filtered this is the second most expensive which is $90 and the third one is called zero water at roughly about $19 now before you invest in anything let second because I want you to know how long these water filters last let a look at the zero water filter for 19 bucks the filters only last for 20 gallons you filters for the whole year so it to cost you $646 for the entire year now let about the next one clearly filtered okay it gallons you seven filters for the year at a cost of $436 a little bit cheaper than the Zero Water Filter now let expensive filter the travel berky gravity filter which initially cost like $327 well guess how many gallons it filters 6,000 it years if you do the math you going to spend like $40 per year most of these chemicals come through your water supply it might be a good idea to invest in something to minimize your exposure because they bioaccumulate these chemicals build up in the body but they don easily there some of these toxins from the body and that now sweating or going into a sauna you will be able to get rid of some of these chemicals through the sweating another interesting way to get rid of the chemicals is through a process process called autophagy now autophagy is a condition that you put your body into when you do intermittent fasting and prolonged fasting where the body recycle old damaged things as well as get rid of pathogens it can also help get rid of chemicals and also strengthen your body because there things that fasting will do to your cells another thing is infrared helps to detoxify your body as well so you can get a lot of infrared being exposed to the sun in the morning and then before the sun sets there there infrared is one way to detoxify some of these chemicals also spirulina and chlorella they this algae that has properties to detoxify chemicals and now let about strengthening your body your biochemistry you naturally have all these amazing things in your body that help you get rid of poisons they called detoxification enzymes and so strengthening your body detoxify is going to be very very important and so anything that has sulfur in it is going to help you and that would be like eggs for example garlic and especially onion but these sulfur-based compounds will greatly help you detoxify and you also have the cruciferous vegetables cabbage broccoli brussels sprouts not only are high and sulfur but they have many other antioxidants that can help the detoxification process and of course the amino acid that important in in strengthening your glutathione is glutamine well take a while guess what has the most glutamine red meat the thing that they tell you to start avoiding glycine is also important and you can get that in collagen which happens to be also in red meat if you consuming nose to tail you bone broth or beef collagen so one of the meals that I normally eat a lot of which happens to be a really good detox meal would be I have some steak or some burger patty and the cruciferous that I like the most is C cabbage and to take it one step further we could ferment the Cabbage why would we want to do that because probiotics also help eliminate these forever chemicals but only if that sourkraut is raw because when you pasteurize it you kill all the microbes now if we have the difference between green cabbage and red cabbage do the red cabbage because then we have some added antioxidants we can start to avoid the exposure to these chemicals but it really really hard to be in an environment that beef up these biochemical Pathways and there that and I now selenium iodine copper the trace minerals are really really important where do these trace minerals come from you can get them from Seafood shellfish and you guessed it grass-fed red meat because these forever chemicals do affect the thyroid you really want to make sure you have enough iodine and selenium selenium you can get from Brazil nuts and you can also get it from shellfish and oysters I just gave you a series of things you should start right now but I wanted to put this on your radar just because unfortunately you being slowly poisoned now you know what to do about it thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video	Success
Get Rid of Mucus Fast	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8vQk0_Wfck	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I want to show you how to clear out your respiratory mucus which includes bronchitis mucus with pneumonia sinusitis any mucus in your respiratory system with something better than Salt now I using salt to get rid of mucus and it good but there and that remedy is NAC NAC is also used in hospitals emergency rooms as the antidote to Tylenol poisoning the benefits of NAC go Way Beyond mucus which I focus on what it does to your mucus NAC basically thins your mucus it makes your mucus less sticky salt will do that as well by absorbing water into the mucus but NAC takes it one step further it very potent anti-inflammatory it also is a very potent antioxidant not only does it thin the mucus but it also stops the production of mucus it strengthens the little hairs the cyia in your respiratory system that helps move mucus and not only that it antiviral and it can even break up something called biofilms which are certain microbe colonies that live within the mucus that are protected sometimes by either calcium or other things and there can take NAC you can take it orally as a supplement you can get it injected certain doctors do that or you can inhale it through a nebulizer and I going to get into a little more details in a little bit on how to take it and the reason I radar because it does a lot you can use it for many different things whether you have mucus from an infection or you have something called clpd which is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease where the lungs are generating a lot of mucus or even a genetic condition that involves the lung in mucus called cystic fibrosis n can come to the rescue and so let first touch on what it does for Tylenol poisoning when someone takes too much Tylenol what it to produce this chemical that deplete glutathione and without glutathione your liver goes right down the tubes you develop liver damage and the liver can literally shut down NAC helps build up glutathione in the liver to protect the liver from breaking down now why can it just doesn precursor to help build up your own glutathione in your liver the other very interesting thing about NAC is it helps enhance brain function because it crosses the blood brain barrier and it can act as a very powerful antioxidant in the brain as well so there pretty uh positive research on using NAC for alimer Parkinson compulsive disorder certain addictions to cocaine marijuana and even gambling depression schizophrenia and just as a side note if you know someone with schizophrenia give them high doses of Nomine that schizophrenia NAC also apparently improves insulin Sensi it so what would that mean that means your blood sugars are going to do much better you going to develop a fatty liver from all that insulin you end up with lower blood pressure and better cholesterol profile so in other words you also people with asthma take NAC and as another side note with that if you have asthma you high doses of vitamin D3 there immune benefits from NAC certain people with HIV take Nic with good results and even if you have a Mercury toxicity apparently ni can act as a key later to bind the Mercury and pull it out of the body if we compare salt for mucus versus NAC for mucus salt is good for acute infections like some quick results with your mucus but NAC goes a lot deeper it handles not just the mucus but the inflammation behind the mucus also the oxidative stress it can kind of put the fire out with that and it can even help modulate or regulate the immune system NAC if we do a comparison is just much better for anything related to mucus in your respiratory system there reports that NAC is good for fibromyalgia and also improving eye problems with certain types of autoimmune diseases and there things you can take in addition to NAC to speed things up let me just list the things that can enhance the NAC effects if you add vitamin C or or curcumin in turmeric a probiotic can be very beneficial magnesium can help the Airways because it also you can add coratin which is a phytonutrient that but of course I think one of the biggest things I would add is the vitamin D and about 20,000 iuse vitamin D is hands down one of the most powerful things to help regulate the immune system so you don first place and if you do you can overcome the infection pretty quick now as far as the NAC dosage I would recommend taking 600 mg three times a day that would be your dosage and the percentage of this liquid NAC would be anywhere between 10 to 20% and you use that in a nebulizer to create a Mist to put it into your sinosis inhale it so it goes down the respiratory tract and into the lungs however taking orally also does work you don use a nebulizer I wanted to make this video fairly short to the point no fluff and since vitamin D is so important with respiratory infections you should probably watch this video right here	Success
How to Look Younger	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpnF4V8stA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we look younger and so in six months I to have my birthday and I 40 okay so I scary because you know that old I it super uh sarcastic because I I 60 and it seems like you old I don and I remember I was in practice I did a lot of seminars and one of the seminars I did was in a an assisted living home there was a patient who lived there she you come to my assisted living home and do a seminar so I did when I got there there was a room full of people that looked really old some of those people in that room were in their 60s and looking back on it I mindblowing to actually go in an assisted living home when you just I can it age faster than others today we to talk about how to reverse that whole process the number one anti-aging mistake that so many people make and that is avoid the Sun and we 365 days out of the year I mean think about it human beings have evolved for eons being exposed to the Sun and now we why are they telling people to avoid the sun well because of something called Ultra Violet radiation okay UV and it basically makes up only 3% of all of the wavelengths 37% is the visible light spectrum and then we have nearly 60% infrared infrared is super therapeutic to your body some people have infrared machines but you can get infrared for free from being on the sun in the early morning also in the late afternoon so regarding the UVU there kinds of UV UVA can very easily go through the clouds so even if it cloudy day it some association with those Rays as well as the Aging of your skin there melanin which is a pigment that natural sun blocker that create a tanning effect if you sun repetitively now UVB has everything to do with making vitamin D what really interesting about these Sun Blockers is that they mainly block out the UVB they don filter out that UVA you know the Rays that affect to aging and when your skin gets enough you Skin telling you it UV is dangerous if you the sun and getting burned and you doing that repetitively even the UVA radiation has some benefits it can increase something called nitric oxide that increases blood flow that increases circulation to the skin people have this question about what about skin cancer okay melanoma what melanoma is that we of sun exposure for quite some time but melanoma has been increasing by a factor of 3,000% also melanoma skin cancer usually occurs on areas that are not exposed to the sun is it really the sun that causing melanomas or could it be related to a lack of vitamin D also bdnf this is something that is in the brain and bdnf actually increases with exposure to the Sun and so when you to Sun you the cells and that antioxidant however in the winter many places around Earth do not allow you to get the UV radiation to make vitamin D if you through your window your glass window you gets filtered out so this idea that the UV is so bad for your skin is completely not true other advice that you useful is to use a good moisturizer I hope you these moisturizers because they are filled with just tons of chemicals they start drying out the skin because probably the alcohol and the mineral oil that pulls out the fat soluble vitamins from your skin when you put the stuff in your skin it gets absorbed into the bloodstream and it ends up in your liver consuming synthetic antioxidants that can create more problems on your skin consuming sugar and junk Foods it going to age the skin very very fast another thing you have to be careful about is overwashing your face with soap some people think that they have to wash their face with soap every day and all that detergent is very harsh on the skin it because you have a microbiome good bacteria around your skin you don to get rid of that chlorine and tap water very harsh on your skin you want to get a filter on your shower and the last thing I want to talk about is antibiotics they create some serious problems with your skin not just talking about just antibiotics that you have taken I that act like an antibiotic birth control pills and acids those are for uh acid reflux steroids statins okay now this next part is fascinating there is a hormone that can increase the stem cells for your skin and just making your skin look awesome stem cells are undifferentiated they haven turned into anything and those stem cells are triggered by oxytocin now wait a second oxytocin they call it the love hormone but they really should call it the health hormone because it has huge regenerative properties it creates all sorts of cool effects that help people um bond to be more social to feel more calm how do we increase oxytocin I did a video on this and there to increase it but the one that I going to talk about is just really cool and that is is basically taking a very specific microb okay and growing it in a culture that ends up looking like yogurt what you have to realize is when you destroy the microbiome whether it is taking an antibiotic or some other way there are certain microbes that end up never coming back and one of the key microbes that doesn called L ruteri and so this microbe that population because of the antibiotics and the other effects needs to be receded it has an effect on wound healing which is wild and yes I to put a link down below of another video I did on how to make your own El rudai in large amounts 300 billion quantities that you maker and you can take a half a cup of this at night I about 3 weeks and I have to say my sleep is incredible I feel incredibly low stress the next thing is cold immersion on your face now whether you have a cold immersion tank or just a bucket of ice water and you put your face in it for let that that is super healthy for rejuvenating your skin on your face it going to increase blood flow it to tighten the pores it stimulate collagen I mean you going to have to test it out and I going to put a link down below of how to do that and of course exercise is very very important for anti-aging especially of your skin and lastly facial exercises can make you look young as well and these involve all sorts of Mile fasal stretches because we really don exercise the face muscles I did a whole video on this and I link down below so you can learn how to do those facial exercises every day and on that note thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video	Success
How to Reverse Aging	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FA2nGFPbAM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now of course we all are going to get old eventually but it age before our time and of course most people don treat the wrinkle and they treat it with creams and serums and Botox all these different things rather than treat it from the inside out what people need to realize is the Aging appearance in the outside of the body is actually happening on the inside as well and when we talking about collagen and connective tissue the fascia that surrounds all of our muscles and all of our body will become stiffened and caus us to be in this certain posture which is usually slumped over and many times by the age of 40 we our connective tissue So today we going to talk about how to prevent this problem as well as reverse it if you have it and of course I premature aging I completely stopping the aging process that is going to be impossible there is a certain enzyme in the body and this enzyme actually breaks down collagen so what are the things that triggers this enzyme to go higher certain antibiotics you also have ultraviolet radiation you burning yourself too much now that can also trigger this however I still recommend that you get a lot of sun okay and I very end of this certain section but let me just make this understandable the more sugar that it clogs everything up okay and if you have a lot of that going on because you eat a lot of refined sugars then you to look really old okay just as a side note I want to EXP explain something about sugar everyone sugar and they and they say wow this doesn sugar but it has a lot of carbohydrate what is that carbohydrate it starch is a bunch of sugar molecules connected together so starch is sugar and when we talk about starch we even talking about like the starch and vegetables like a salad or even a potato we processed starch that is called either maltodextrin modified food starch way worse than actual sugar even though there might be no sugar in something you have to understand the label there could be other starches which is just basically hidden sugar but there is something it protect you against the loss of collagen this is why I recommend everyone should be taking at least 10,000 IUS of vitamin D3 for many different reasons one being the protection against the premature aging and also there are certain cells in your body that make collagen the most potent stimulus of collagen is exercise adding Motion in your body versus being sedentary all you have to do is start using the body and it start to make more collagen now as we get older we having injury on our joints so there couple things that I always recommend as we get older to focus more on the plank exercise where you position that tension but you joints and you collagen just from that there another type of exercise called Ecentric exercises where you muscle you so let push-up position and then you just slowly let yourself down okay it creates a super amount of tension and stimulus of collagen also if you bar and you pull yourself up and then you slowly let yourself down you lengthening the muscles one of the things that will really strengthen pretty much all of the collagen in your body is to do sprinting but you do it on a very gradual level to the point where you are basically causing your body to adapt to that motion but also all the vessels around the heart the valves the tissues because it looking younger it healthier all over then we get to nutrients there are certain nutrients that we need to make collagen at the top of the list is Vitamin C so our bodies need Vitamin C to help form collagen and there one is sugar and the other is smoking and by the way as a side note the best uh food that has the highest amount of vitamin C is raw sauerkraut so a couple that a day you for vitamin C the next most important uh co-actor or helper for collagen is vitamin K2 vitamin K2 is known for keeping your cartilage your ligaments your tendons the fascia and your skin nice and useful and where do we get vitamin K2 you can get it from eating liver egg yolks and you might be able to get it from some butter as well the next co-actor I magnesium magnesium allows your body to make collagen magnesium is involved in 300 different enzymes in the body it also allows that vitamin D to work which actually prevents the breakdown of collagen where do we get magnesium dark chocolate almonds and spinach and things like that the next co-actor and this is really important too zinc zinc keeps your skin very youthful zinc also speeds up wound healing and where do we get zinc from oysters have the most zinc you can also get it from red meat and also liver and then the last co-actor I going to talk about is copper copper you can also get in oysters red meat shellfish liver and dark chocolate I also want to touch on something thing that can really make you older is Ideal Protein it it protein and very low fat and all the other artificial stuff that just makes someone look older and they would have problems with the gallbladder and the liver your quality protein is important too instead of doing this plant-based isolate type proteins or even any other uh plant-based proteins I would just recommend mostly grass-fed beef but realize when you consume a lot of your protein just from chicken like lean turkey meat even pork you lot more omega-6 fatty acids you getting as much omega-3 fatty acids but when you have grass-fed grass finish you another thing that is autophagy it means self- eat okay and you turn those into new proteins it of an anti-aging effect and to achieve that one thing you can do is do intermittent fasting so you snacking all the time you two meals a day maybe one meal a day and your body is healing so that thing that there know people who haven period of time they age quickly because of the stress and the cortisol that occurs too so we need a lot of sleep and exercise can help reduce stress but there on your radar if you about this you should check it out one of the most powerful antistress hormones is called oxytocin and there make your own cultivated dairy product with a very specific microbe to grow that in a milk culture that you consume a half a cup of this every single day and the cool effect that it has on your body is that that microb releases something that travels up through a nerve called the vagus nerve right up into the brain and it goes right into the hypothalamus and there waiting there to be triggered and so that particular microbe in sufficient amounts releases a lot of oxytocin which greatly helps your sleep and greatly lowers your stress to the point where you can actually rejuvenate your skin and your muscles so in this video I given you more than enough to start reversing some of the aging process and definitely to prevent the premature aging or wrinkling of your skin and if you want more information how to increase your oxytocin I put that video right here check it

7 Warning Signs of Parasites and How to Fight Back	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n32DVD3CiM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let that you may have parasites you probably already have parasites the good news is they turned into some disease the first sign is fatigue number two a rash and this is because of your immune system reacting because when a parasite invades the barrier in your gut for example and gets in your blood you can have an immune reaction that shows up in your skin number three weight loss with no reason for losing weight weight you exercise program you haven your diet the parasite is eating a lot of your nutrition it small intestine it start developing nutritional deficiencies number four is bloating because there and it number five teeth grinding do you grind your teeth a lot at night think parasite number six itching especially in your private parts like anal itching and number seven anxiety and so when you have an imbalance of microorganisms a parasite that head and that could be related to uh brain fog as well there Theory it hypothesis where you have the host and the parasite that is co-evolving existing together competing for resources each side develops new strategies and for example if we never had parasites or pathogens which create infection it would never Force us to become stronger to develop certain strategy IES of survival your immune system learns from it and becomes stronger so the next time you infected you have antibodies sitting there waiting to defend you our immune system develops a defense against parasites there that are released by cells to help kill the worm or whatever organism there is on the flip side parasites have their own strategies one strategy is to evade your immune system and one way they do that is to downgrade your ability to absorb vitamin D in fact 10% of all of the genes that you have are associated with vitamin d and vitamin D also controls a lot of the the te- cells the ones that are the quarterback that control and coordinate your immune system another wild strategy from a parasite is to change the behavior of the host one example of this is something called Toxoplasma Gandhi which causes the rodent the mouse to become Fearless so it will be more likely to be eaten by a cat because Toxoplasma Gandhi only can thrive in cats but somehow they have to alter the behavior to be able to survive another strategy that parasites use is to take a certain protein and cover themselves to evade the immune system and because this protein mimics something in your body or something that be able to go dormant and wait until you immune system is weak and then they can kick in and actually come out and start surviving better because they can survive if your immune system is really strong and so some microorganisms can change its relationship and become parasitic if the environment changes in your body let take for example eoli in the large intestine uh ecoli I lives in a friendly manner but when that eoli goes up into the small intestine and in that environment that eoli becomes parasitic another microbe that can become a parasite is hpylori most ulcers come from H pylori and one survival mechanism that this H pylori does is they release something that alkalizes the stomach because they can survive better there not as much acid you can even get a parasite from breathing dirt particles in the air from some construction because there microorganisms in the soil or what about you have a pet a cat or a dog that sleeps with you that you kiss animals are outside they can pick up a parasite and they can very easily give you a parasite as well another way to get parasites is when you take antibiotics for example you literally kill off the good bacteria and the bad bacteria this really puts you at a major risk immune wise also realize if you consume a lot of refined sugar and junk you going to feed these parasites right they they love that refined starches and flour products you want to get rid of all that now I want to get into what to do if you actually have parasites what can you do to clean them out or kill them and remove them from the body these Herbal Remedies will kill these microbes as a natural antibiotic there sometimes there constipated and you can even get like symptoms for like two weeks I you really what to do to prevent the negative effects take something to keep the bod duct open and free flowing and I would recommend finding a product called TKA TKA is a type of bile salt that helps open up the flow of sludge through the bile du itself I would take TKA for two days and you want to take it on an empty stomach take two in the morning two in the afternoon then you can roll into what I a series of natural anti-parasitic herbal things and foods to help Purge and kill parasites directly and indirectly what you do is get rid of the excess of these parasites to the point where your immune system can then take hold and take over and regulate it so there overwhelming infection I don there there if your immune system is strong you totally fine the two remedies called wormwood extract and clove are really good at killing parasitic eggs you don need to take a lot of this you usually see directions on the label just follow what those directions are and I recommend taking these remedies with a meal I mean you effect in your body you enough of these to make it very uncomfortable for these microbes to exist because all the remedies I telling you are antiparasitic the next really important remedy would be black walnut extract I don ever seen a black walnut we have several trees in the hall it is so bitter and it has this incredible strong odor that is very very anti- parasitic the next thing and I in your food is two or three garlic cloves a day garlic hands down is one of the most anti-parasitic remedies in existence that would be the basics there like oregano oil that but you don overdo it because just like it can kill off a parasite it can create a reaction on your body as well if you it even pumpkin seeds right there certain chemical that parasites it actually causes paralysis of the parasite as far as a probiotic I just would include daily fermented vegetables raw sauerkraut kimchi kefir and last lastly we do not want to forget this vitamin D remember the parasite downgraded the vitamin D receptor so unless you have enough vitamin D your immune system might not be strong enough to deal with it and I would take no less than 20,000 I use but I 30 or maybe even 40,000 I use a vitamin D3 to really make sure that it works you want to take the magnesium and zinc with vitamin D thanks for watching and if you haven lot you should check this out I put that video up right here	Success
The Forgotten Hormone	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I want to talk about progesterone the Forgotten hormone in men we associate progesterone with women problems menopause menstrual cycle what do progesterone do in men today I to talk about the importance of progesterone in men especially as it precursor for testosterone what interesting about progesterone is it helps maintain normal testosterone levels progesterone also decreases inflammation in the brain it anti-inflammatory it increases neurogenesis which is the creation of new brain cells progesterone definitely helps protect against dementia Parkinson also has anti-depressant effects as well that progesterone does on the brain but when someone increase the production of sperm progesterone helps also maintain muscle mass it progesterone also helps to maintain the prostate and to prevent the enlargement of the prostate in fact the drug called finasteride is a synthetic derivative of progesterone one of the things that that drug as well as progesterone does is it inhibits the enzyme that from testosterone to something called DHT which is a more powerful form of testosterone which can then increase the size of the prostate this drug will inhibit that enzyme to help shrink the prostate but progesterone does it also in a very natural way without the side effects another thing that progesterone does is it helps reduce the risk of breast tissue in men how do we end up with low progesterone and how do we increase the normal amounts of progesterone so then we can have more testosterone and other related hormones all of these steroid hormones come from this raw material called cholesterol and this is why cholesterol is so important especially in hormones a lot of people are on a Statin drug which automatically shuts off your ability to make all of these really important hormones let just start at that level and then we going to kind of work our way down to see how we can improve this whole pathway where do you get cholesterol from you of cholesterol in sardines organ Meats like liver and you get some cholesterol in fatty meat you can also get cholesterol from cheese but not the lowfat cheese you want to get the whole milk cheese then cholesterol is then turned into what pregnant alone is a happy hormone because it actually help helps increase other hormones the question is should you start taking pregnant alone not right away I wouldn jumping and taking it if you were to take pregnant alone as a supplement and you can get it over the counter it very easy to get but pregnant alone is the precursor that comes right before progesterone I would always recommend starting out maybe 5 to 10 milligram only that not need that but I out there if you try the co-actors and it that that a little later there are three co-actors that allow you to go from cholesterol to pregn Alone number one is magnesium people are commonly deficient in magnesium a problem with low testosterone could be easily solved just by taking enough magnesium type of magnesium I glycinate I would recommend taking that before you go to bed which will then open the door to allow this whole Cascade of hormones to work magnesium you can get in avocados leafy greens pumpkin seeds dark chocolate the next co-actor is zinc many people increase their testosterone levels just by taking zinc zinc you can get shellfish oyers red meat and the last co-actor is vitamin B3 niin you can get that from nutritional yeast you can take that as a supplement take the nin that gives you the flesh it can help your heart I given you a couple things to increase this biochemical pathway I do want to touch on things that can inhibit this biochemical pathway at different points I already mentioned the one Statin Statin is just like notoriously bad for blocking hormones okay because it blocks the raw material to make it if you a Statin or your doctor wants to put you on a Statin I would step back and re-evaluate why do you really need that there are a lot of cardiologists that you can even work with they against statin drugs if you wanted to balance out your lipid profile your cherol there it one way is just to cut down on the refined carbohydrates and sugar unfortunately the medical profession doesn you a medication to block cholesterol you better be taking co-enzyme Q10 very very very very important because if you don your muscle because that big side effects is it depletes something called coin mq10 there are three other things that will inhibit this whole process number one is chronic stress how do we lower stress ashwaganda Vitamin B1 one of the biggest things that can lower stress is by increasing proding something called oxytocin by taking a certain fermented microbe which can build up your oxytocin levels and greatly reduce your stress the next thing that can actually shut down this whole pathway is insulin this comes from consuming too many refining carbs or sugars third thing endocrine disruptors things in the environment Plastics chemicals heavy metals are things that mimic estrogen there couple things to help reduce some of these estrogenic effects one is to on a regular bases consume cruciferous vegetables brussels sprouts cabbage broccoli cauliflower arugula also to get a water filter that will screen out some of these Plastics that was number three there will really shut down your testosterone I click off I there shut down that whole pathway and that is inflammation a lot of the inflammation that happens in the body can be resolv by consuming enough vitamin D vitamin D can indirectly increase both progesterone and testosterone by decreasing inflammation and you don want to just take small amounts you want to take at least 10,000 IUS every single day as a maintenance and if you have low testosterone or low progesterone we want to make sure we get enough sun to get the vitamin D or just take a supplement for that about 20,000 I use of vitamin D3 every day that minutes in the Summer sun okay it that much but that vitamin D will be really crucial to drop inflammation through the body and allow these chemical Pathways to work in addition to just cholesterol if you want to increase testosterone you want to make sure that you have enough quality protein and red meat is at the top of the list I talking about grass-fed grassfish red meat not just talking about beef you can do lamb if we combine that with another thing that will increase testosterone which is high-intensity interval training or resistance training couple times a week we can really add the stimulus to tell the body to make more testosterone one point with exercise as well overtraining if you overtrain you and just drive it right into the ground why because you increase cortisol we want to do intermittent type workouts you can do long walk walks things like that you don rate or high pulse rate for a longer period of time not good for testosterone I hope you know a little bit more about progesterone what it does how it related to testosterone and if you man how to increase it a bit more thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video	Success
The #1 Best Probiotic for Autoimmune Conditions	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jIXMc3PS0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today let best probiotic for autoimmune conditions so the question is what is an autoimmune condition it own immune system is attacking its own tissues what immune system is we have two parts of the immune system that are out of balance we have either a very low amount of this thing called regulatory te- cells and then at the same time we have high amounts of these other two immune cells all you really need to know to make this really simple is that these T-Rex cell prevent autoimmune diseases so it about calming down the inflammation after your immune system has done its job the t- cells turn it off so the t-reg cells are all about appropriate response but the problem is in the flip side it can sometimes get out of control and attack the wrong thing the best way to understand this is to look at a thermostat autoimmune diseases are running too hot there inflammation the question is how do we take an autoimmune disease and bring it to an optimal level it just so happens that there but I think it the root problem of all autoimmune diseases one thing you really need to know is that when there in the gut okay sometimes you don initially feel it but inflammation blocks the function of vitamin D3 vitamin D3 cannot work in the presence of of inflammation vitamin D influences over 2500 genes it of the immune system so if the T-Rex cells do not get enough vitamin D then they can can functional and many people including a lot of doctors don have a such a mass uh problem with low vitamin D there is a condition called vitamin D resistance and vitamin D resistance is at the cell level right at the re ctors for vitamin D3 you see you can actually test someone the blood and it can be perfectly normal but if they have vitamin D resistance despite having a normal blood level they and many people don great majority of the population is vitamin D resistant in your blood what they vitamin D is the inactive version they at the cell level but the vitamin D you need for the immune system is more like 8,000 to 10,000 just to maintain it and not only that you need it on a daily basis rarely is anyone getting that amount unless they of sun or taking a supplement so if you compound a inflammatory gut problem with low vitamin D it developing an autoimmune disease and on top of that you have doctors or you might have things on the news or online that say that vitamin D you got to be careful you don just so you know it you would have to take hundreds of thousands of international units every single day for months before you develop any toxicity so when we 10,000 iuse we ballpark for even talking about toxicity and the reason I is to penetrate through that vitamin D resistance that so many people have to create a therapeutic effect you to have to use levels that are much higher than $10,000 use you going to have to go up 20 30 40 50,000 international units every single day to penetrate that resistance to create an effect on the t-reg cells so that microbes you have thousands of different species of microbes in your gut and they do a lot more than you might think and there involved in helping you prevent autoimmune diseases in that they greatly affect the t-reg cells as well as suppressing these other inflammatory immune cells over here and the first one is called be infantis or it might be pronounced infantis I help develop our nervous system this microb is highly sensitive to antibiotics to steroids to junk foods to a lot of things in the environment and so what I population is just missing seeing this microbe right here and this microbe is very important in helping you support this t-reg cell Al rudai is another really key microbe and unfortunately it too is very sensitive to broadspectrum antibiotics 97% of the population is missing this microbe too the other thing that is it helps to increase this hormone called oxytocin which is probably one of the most potent antistress hormones ever now why is that important we can keep our immune system healthy you have to realize when we through stress we have high levels of cortisol cortisol suppresses the immune system normally should have like 35 billion white blood cells these are the soldiers that do all the work and when you suppresses the entire immune system just think about what is the treatment to autoimmune disease prazone what is prazone it version of cortisol it shuts down the entire immune system we also shut down the healing part of the immune system this is why people that have had too many steroid shots basically destroy their joints it acts as an antibiotic so vitamin D is not an immune suppressant that shuts the whole thing down only the parts that are overactive so this microb helps to kind of cool things down but this has a bigger effect over the entire immune system and I don taking these in a pill I recommend cultivating these with a dairy product to increase these and that help recede the small intestine start healing the small intestine and then start to build up the te reg cells so number one vitamin D is essential number two you reestablish the microbes that are usually missing and number three selenium now what does selenium do well that in small amounts uh I would recommend like 200 micrograms not milligrams but selenium has a very unique function for the immune system if you selenium you amounts of these two inflammatory cells and remember in autoimmune they already too high so we have to lower this so selenium is going to help lower these two cells right here also selenium is going to help lower the antibodies and I Auto antibodies which are involved in this self attack your own immune system is attacking itself selenium can help turn that down you can also take it as a supplement and the last point I to bring up about this is prolong fasting when you do prolong fasting you can greatly increase the t-reg cells and there rid of inflammation by doing periodic prolong fasting I three days at a time you anything you you greatly improve your immune system system to the point where you can create new stem cells to build up your immune system so these three things right here are the most important things to help shift this very hot immune system problem bring it back to an Optimum temperature so you can put this autoimmune disease back in remission now since I spent a little more time in this vitamin D if you have not seen this video on vitamin D it idea to check it out and I put that up right here	Success
The Fastest Way to Get Rid of Toenail Fungus	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzNMBwzZv4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we get rid of this toenail fungus toenail fungus is really not a problem of the toenail it if you just treat it right here in this location you may or may not be successful long term and one of the big problems of treating the toenail fungus with medication is if you treating it for a period of time which is usually about three months there are side effects that come along with it like liver damage wouldn do something that didn effects before we get to the solution I want to quick just go through a couple little facts that you need to know about tonal fungus if you look up the actual cause it and then you all of a sudden got this Tona fungus A lot of people have sweaty wet feet and they don fungus this specific toenail fungus can invade the toenail but it can also cause other skin infections jock itch athletes foot infections in your beard infections in the skin on your legs and even your scalp this specific microb lives on protein and it your nail it just so happens to be pure protein one of the problems that people have treating this topically is that the cream does not penetrate deep enough in the nail to kill off the microbe this microb is bearing itself deep inside the protein part of the nail and there very unique about this microbe and how it survives it has the ability to evade or Escape your immune system defense and there one is it grows really slowly over time so your immune system doesn necessarily see it number two it has the ability to suppress your teac cells the other thing that it can do is it can go into a dormant State and then wait for the right moment to come out of remission and it could stay in this dormant state for years this microbe is uniquely resistant to UV radiation part of the sunlight spectrum is called ultraviolet and that does have the ability to kill C microbes and fungus but not this specific microbe called T ruum it can survive despite how much UV that you put on it so you couldn necessarily put a UV light directly on the toe now it wouldn part is going to give you the secret of the treatment for getting rid of this tonal fungus remember when I said that this micro can go into a dormant state that means it can be reawakened at certain times when the timing is just right so the first question is what are the triggers to go into this dormant sleep State well the number one trigger to cause this microb to go into this dormant state is when your immune system especially these tea cells can finally work and attack it your body system is a very hostile environment for pathogens including this fungus and it forces the microb to go into this hibernation mode this remission recently there was a kind of a hurricane that came through we lost power for a couple days and I have a garage with a freezer filled with meat and each portion of meat is in this vacuum sealed plastic we have a backup generator and so I assumed that all of our freezers were working somehow it blew a fuse in the garage and I did not know that until 2 weeks later inside those plastic packages with the meat see worms crawling around I see microbes moving around I heck where did that come from they couldn plastic because I had them so protected well those microbes were already in there in a dormant State and so much of the microbes that we have even in our body the good bacteria also can go in a dormant State apparently some of the bacteria around that meat woke up with the trigger of having a certain warmer temperature and so one goal is to take this fungus and put it into a dormant state if someone were to put some antifungal cream or take anti-fungal medication that would also put it into a dormant state not necessarily kill it then when you stop taking the medication it doesn comes out of remission another thing that will cause it to go into a dorm state is having the environment being cooler and dry so then the next question is how do we wake up this microb that dormant on your toenail well we actually can change the environment we warm up the environment we make it moist we add a little sweat in there and it can wake it up but having a warm moist environment is not enough to actually cause a microbe just to appear there another trigger to wake them up is to change a part of the environment that involves pH because this microbe grows best in a pH of eight which is pretty alkaline so it doesn environment and normally your skin is acidic this next thing is the most important thing the biggest activator to of having this dormant microbe become alive is when your immune system gets suppressed how does your immune system gets suppressed stress being a diabetic being overweight taking in an antibotic because now we killed off all the bacteria and the bacteria are there to keep this fungus in check so if you have an imbalance there this is when we get an overgrowth of certain fungus but the biggest thing that will reawaken dormant microb especially a fungus is having a vitamin D deficiency your immune system becomes suppressed vitamin D is the most important nutrient to support and allow the immune system to work in the toenail you have a lot of receptors for vitamin D and these funguses have a unique strategy of downgrading the vitamin D receptors not only is this microb shutting down your immune system but it ability to use vitamin D the goal is just to be able to activate your immune system Army against this darn pathogen that the environment so hostile for this fungus that it just stays in a dormant State you don regular ular amount of vitamin D3 you need to take more vitamin D at least 25,000 international units every single day now some people need to take it even a little bit more but what this is going to do it system to the point where this fungus has no choice but to go into a dormant State and we all over because it problem it don don you could find liquid vitamin D and put it on your toenail topically I 100% sure if it would speed things up but it case studies and other reports of people using higher doses of vitamin D3 there been a pretty good success at riding this tonal fungus and doing it without side effects because in the end you have your immune system back there other things that I as well zinc but not just any type of zinc zinc python this form of ink is just not talked about very often and sometimes they put it into a cream sometimes they will put it into a certain soap which probably would be a good idea but it has very powerful antifungal properties here we have the vitamin D to help you from the inside out with your immune system and then from the outside in we use zinc topically the other thing I recommend is to get some shoes that are breathable because we want to change the temperature and we want to keep the feed as dry as possible also change your socks very frequently wash them wash the SHO shoes so that this fungus can and live in your shoes and when you use detergent when you wash them that detergent usually will kill off the fungus as well now you have a plan and a solution that won side effects thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video	Success
Regenerate Your Stem Cells	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpU4JrUgqMw	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today I to stimulate your stem cells without having to go to a clinic and go through any surgical procedure or spend thousands and thousands of dollars a stem cell is kind of like this Reserve cell that can pretty much change into anything that you need they now to regenerate fibrosis which then allows the heart muscle function to improve by 30% they can do the same thing with liver fibrosis and damage brain cells they results stimulating carage in your joint some people are using it for autoimmune diseases like Ms and also to help rejuvenate skin cells to actually make the skin young again there cells for cancer it understand how to keep that stem cell population at the highest level let start with number one fasting specifically prolonged fasting if you could fast for 72 hours which is 3 days you can in a major way boost certain stem cells Prim for the gastrointestinal tract for your brain and your immune system when you fasting you you basically clearing everything out of your digestive system and because there they actually start surviving better and those stem cells start to repair damage within your digestive tract and the other thing that fasting your body is taking damaged tissue Recycling and turning that into new tissue inamin fasting is important too of course it potent as fasting longer number two exercise exercise stimulates stem cells for your muscles and your brain this is exercise where it more difficult you body in a functional way to create a lot of effort or intensity and the most potent stimulus of the stem cell when you exercise is intensity if you can do an intense exercise short duration the more stem cell you when you exercise you stimulate something called bdnf brain Drive neurotropic Factor this is like Miracle growth for the brain it allows you to make new nerve cells or brain cells the other stem cells that you exercise is the stem cells that help prepare the inside layer of the arteries called the endothelial layer this is the layer that becomes damaged and then a person will develop a clogged artery or inflammation guess what both fasting and exercise reduce inflammation so that can indirectly influence your stem cells we know as you age the stem cells go down exercise will preserve that to a certain degree number three deep quality sleep when you melatonin melatonin increases the stem cells for your brain of course on the opposite of that when you you have insomnia that can inhibit your stem cells stress inhibits stem cells a quality sleep can reduce cortisol stress which can then indirectly increase stem cells and also deep sleep will increase your immune system stem cell and this is probably why when someone more sleep they can get because it allows the body to strengthen the stem cells lastly with regard to sleep a quality sleep cycle can improve the stem cells that help the cardiovascular system specifically the heart muscle itself think about it the heart has to keep beating 24/7 all the time and so it needs some time to rest well it keeps beating even when you sleep but with a really good quality sleep you can actually at least develop more stem cells to help rejuvenate the heart tissue itself and it people that have insomnia have high risk of getting heart attacks good night rest can really help your heart number four green tea specifically a certain phytonutrient called EG B CG this chemical in green tea is an anti-inflammatory green tea which is a very popular tea around the world has the potential to increase stem cells for your brain and for your liver and on top of that it can decrease the stem cells for cancer cells which is a good thing number five omega-3 fatty acids this would be the fish oils the cive oil now the big thing people know about these fish oils is that they anti-inflammatory so we already know know that decreasing inflammation can increase stem cell but omega-3 has the ability to increase stem cell for bone cartilage brain and skin number six vitamin d slash the sun both the Sun and especially vitamin D will increase stem cells and people that are deficient in vitamin D are going to have a problem with stem cells and another interesting function of vitamin D is to help maintain the blood stem cells that are involved with your immune Sy system vitamin D increases new immune cells vitamin D also prevents the exhaustion of stem cells specifically of the brain the immune system and the muscles this is probably another reason why vitamin D helps you live longer and then number seven cold therapy I cold immersion or even a cold shower but being in the cold stimulates Brown fat stem cells which has a lot to do with muscle repair decreasing inflammation help supporting the mitochondria with more blood flow in general which brings more nutrition to the stem cells as well as boosting a very specific protein I already talked about this bdnf braind drived neurotrophic Factor this is the Miracle Grow for the brain and it pretty well because every time I do the cold immersion I feel like my brain is just working so much better personally I that cold helps your cognitive function do better as well as your mood I have mentioned a few things that destroy the stem cells inflammation stress lack of sleep junk food is another thing alcohol smoking pollution any chronic inflammation the last point I want to bring up is this cancer stem cell the stem cells for cancer act very similar to certain types of bacteria that do not need oxygen one way to decrease the stem cell for cancer is to flood the body with oxygen and this is why exercise is so important this is why Hyperbaric decreases certain types of cancer because you that you oxygen because of what oxygen does to the nature of a stem cell for cancer adding more oxygen will destroy it and if we compare those cells to cancer cells we have a very unique difference in relationship to genes that protect against dehydration our cells have at least 50 different genes that help us cope with dehydration but the cancer cells have none of those genes in other words a cancer cell is more vulnerable to dehydration than our cells how can we use this information one of the things that people do is they do a dry fast where they they fact if you look at the data with dry fasting you can actually triple your results apparently it to the cancer cells than our own cells because we are a little more protected let you drank nothing or you ate nothing that would be an example of intermittent dehydration we restricting the amount of water per day we water at certain times it look into and I your radar now if you have not seen my video on dry fasting you should check it out it

Do NOT Make These Mistakes (Especially After 50)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJeTsPEiXRA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today I want to discuss the real common mistakes that people make that end up keeping them very unhealthy this information becomes very important as you age especially over 50 but if you younger take notes and you not going to find this information if you just ask your average doctor they not expert in nutrition they just don get the training whatever they recommend go in the opposite direction it giving you a label for a certain condition that then matching that with a medication I a lot more interested in getting to the root cause so number one you want to really make sure that the source of your information that you get is based on someone who has a lot of experience in results in the problem you solve number two be very careful about accepting a diagnosis that just doesn seem right number three make sure that the solution or the treatment that you get doesn your current symptoms AKA side effects and that relates to this next point if you expose yourself to too much stress it kind of gets stuck into your mind and you sleep and you this constant state of fear unfortunately nowadays it impossible to avoid it because it everywhere the next thing I want to talk about before I get into nutrition is your environment I didn first how important your environment was until I had this great opportunity to move out of the city into the farm I going to tell you having that space is such a therapy it so important to do this on a regular basis and the next thing is regular consistent EX exercise and what exercise does is it kind of flushes out the cortisol and the adrenaline that builds up just from being on this planet if you exercise more on a wave versus a sustained High puls rate exercise it healthier next Point what are the most important nutrients that you should be getting on a regular basis the most important one is vitamin D think about your genetics you have like 20,000 to 25 5,000 different genes did you know that vitamin D influences 10% of those genes to create a therapeutic effect for vitamin D you need to use 10,000 20,000 30,000 50,000 or more of vitamin D3 to really create an effect there medical doctor who specializes in autoimmune diseases this medical doctor gets results he has over 900 videos on testimonials before and after that you can see just using high doses of vitamin D3 there doctors that are using high doses of vitamin D3 to remodel certain parts of the eye and repair really difficult things like glucoma there doctors using high doses of vitamin D3 to shrink fibroids so vitamin D is super super important for your health and of course getting more sun too and we just don important nutrient is magnesium it very rare that anyone gets enough magnesium magnesium magesium is involved in thousands of different things in the body every different type of heart disease usually has a magnesium deficiency but magnesium goes Way Beyond the heart if you don magnesium you can vitamin D magnesium and number three is zinc zinc is a trace mineral zinc is very very important and a lot of people are deficient in zinc and they all really depend on each other in other words you could be taking a lot of vitamin D3 and be very deficient in magnesium and zinc and vitamin D won work so you kind of need all three of those and the flip side what are the two nutrients that you have to be careful of taking because they become very toxic number one calcium as we age calcium tends to plug everything up and guess what magnesium is the regulator of that and so if you don enough on a regular basis you to put yourself at risk for heart disease why because you don controlling factor of calcium and it gets into the soft tissues and then the other nutrient that than too much calcium is too much iron we have a ex extreme difficulty in getting rid of iron at the very most per day we only get rid of .5 to one milligram of iron yet the RDA for iron is 8 milligrams and if you childbearing age it we have too much iron you out your organs you want to start looking at labels start avoiding certain things to make sure you don yourself with iron even if you have a genetic problem with iron which is the person really is not deficient in Iron they just have an accumulation of iron in the wrong place iron is very very toxic and I never recommend taking it in a supplement next mistake is to avoid salt there salt and table salt always recommend sea salt because sea salt has 84 minerals if someone is salt sensitive in reality they because potassium and sodium work together and we need a considerable amount of sod and you get that from sea salt and when you your cortisol goes up this can affect your sleeping this can make you stressed it rdas for potassium you need 4700 migr that for generating energy for your nerves and your muscles every single day I don someone recently asked a question what should I be doing as I go through menopause and I said well make sure you foods you like what are you kidding doctor well what happens when we age is we start having a decrease in hormones testosterone progesterone estrogen things like that and all of those hormones are built out of cholesterol when you start to cut down your cholesterol or you take certain medications that cut down your cholesterol you really cut down those hormones that are already tanked and very very low so having sufficient amounts of the raw material cholesterol in your diet is very very important especially as you age we need cholesterol for our brain bio salts to help digest fats most importantly we need cholesterol to make hormones where do we get cholesterol butter eggs dairy shellfish and just as a side note just think about this diabetes is too much sugar in your blood wouldn logical sense to start cutting down sugar and carbohydrates in fact what they focus more on is making sure you have some glucose tablets in your pocket or Cann in your pocket if your blood sugars become too low because the medication is pushing it too low why not just take less medication if you come off the carbs this whole thing is insane but it sugar carbohydrates it this other carbohydrate called starch most of the starch that people are eating is not really listed as starch on the labels it words modified food starch but then you get into the wheat flour all of that is starch next point in your diet you have proteins carbohydrates and fats which one would be the most important to focus on as far as to create Health proteins are the most important why because most of your body is protein not just muscle connective tissue but your immune system antibodies white blood cells and a person an insect an animal will continue to eat until their protein requirements are satisfied so just take a look at junk food right there protein in junk food you know the cereal boxes the crackers the cookies look look at the protein it what food would give you the most healing right off the bat grass-fed beef grass-fed lamb that nutrient-dense food to heal the gut to give you trace minerals to give you B vitamins but also to give you the highest quality protein I mean think about it as we age especially over 50 we start losing our muscle you need to keep your protein at a higher level with each meal you can also get a super concentrated amount of these nutrients from organ Meats I wish I like liver I don however there love in fact sometimes I crave it and it the reason I liver is because is one of the best sources I consume it probably twice a week all right next point is very very important the frequency of eating let say you day and you were to consume them just twice a day versus six times a day all those extra meals creates more of a problem for you because every time you eat you stimulate insulin producing too much insulin is probably the single biggest problem right now behind so many chronic illnesses not just diabetes but a fatty liver high blood pressure we talked about reducing the carbohydrates now we snacking grazing at night it good if you could just take your snacks if it them to the meal and just had two meals a day I think that would be awesome because then you can actually do in a minute fasting and you can create a lot of improvements with that because it going to reduce your insulin next point you should know about autoimmune diseases where your immune system is attacking itself it problem out there I think it combination of a couple things number one the person has low vitamin D but I don has to do with microbes viruses and other pathogens that are constantly trying to invade our body and create all these problems and one of the strategies that they do is they downgrade your vitamin D receptor now normal amounts of vitamin D don because the microbe is really smart there occurs just before this infection because in practice I ran into this these people almost always had a stress event right before they developed this autoimmune disease loss of a loved one loss of a job loss of something what happens when a person goes through a severe shock what happens to the immune system system it becomes suppressed with high levels of cortisol things can happen to the immune system and if you have this shift in the immune system where this immune system starts inappropriately attacking its own tissue and develops an autoimmune disease not only that prazone which is a synthetic type of cortisol will shut down the immune system too this is why they use it for autoimmune diseases anything like rashes on the skin the greatest single thing you can do for stress is exercise and do things to change the environment that you yourself to so much Insanity now the last thing and I think one of the most important things you need to know about in relationship to your health is the recognition that your microbiome in your gut actually is an organ people think it not part of us it is part of us it more than our own cell and it the gut microbiome and the significance or impact that those microbes create on your health is huge why the heck would we ever want to even take an antibiotic and kill them off it realize is when you take an antibiotic you will never have the same microbes ever again a lot of these microbes never grow back it that oh yeah you actually decrease the number of microbes and they normal just like before no that the importance of supporting the gut microbes as an organ is vital for what immune protection the neurotransmitters that are created your mood your cognitive function is influenced by the microbes there are made by these microbes a lot of your digestion is related to microbes your ability to get rid of cancer is related to these microbes your ability to sleep good is related to these microbes the list goes on and on and on that it consume fermented foods sauerkraut kimchi yogurt and taking a very good probiotic would be very very smart I covered a lot of stuff in this video I think all of it especially if you apply a lot of this information before you right now because Health has to be created it doesn happen but I ingredients for creating health and I think the next most relevant video for you to watch would be on the best foods to eat to create health and for that I put this video up right

Use Your Feet As Warning Signs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	your feet are a diagnostic window into your health problems in other words this right here will tell you a lot about early signs of many different problems at the end of this video you have the ability to understand a lot about what just by looking at your foot or someone else and we have the foot and this little connection between the heart and the foot is your blood vessels you have the most oxygen starting at the heart and you have the least oxygen starting in your foot the foot is going to receive oxygen and nutrition through tiny little capillaries if someone has sugar in their blood as in diabetes it show up in your foot first as the earliest sign I series of indicators that will tell you what first topic I want to cover is something called peripheral neuropathy you might start with numbness or even like burning and then it can go into some weird Sensations it just feels abnormal that because the sensory nerves are breaking down because of mainly one missing vitamin called vitamin B1 thyine there not enough thyine in that nerve to allow the nerve to work that nerve is dependent on B1 you need a very special type of B vitamin that has been changed to a fat cable version and the name of that is called benot toine I in the description of how to spell it there to allow the nerve to work and there couple things that will deplete B1 from the nerve sugar destroys nerves if you drink a lot of alcohol it destroys your liver sugar and alcohol deplete B1 and you want to put that back benot toine is what you need whatever it recommends in the dosage on the back of the bottle times four because you want to take more to really penetrate to fix this problem right here another diag notic indicator or a window to look inside your body is to notice if your toes get blue could be the finger tips too it has to do with a part of the nervous system called the sympathetic nervous system another word for that is called the fight ORF flight system and there system in that it overactivated one of the treatments for this the medical treatment is they use a calcium channel blocker when they exposed to cold their fingers in their toes become blue what would be a natural version of a calcium channel blocker that primary regulator of calcium that stuck inside the cell and so one cause of high blood pressure is too much calcium because calcium is all about contraction and magnesium is all about relaxation so magnesium fixes this over contraction problem the thing to know about magnesium is that you don to just take any type of magnesium you want to take magnesium iium glycinate because that absorb like 80% the next one also relates to what I just talked about foot cramps especially at night or in the early morning magnesium in the tissue is going to be lowest in the early morning you can also get those cramps in the calf muscle right above here cramps or charlie horses are the earliest symptom of a magnesium deficiency the simple remedy is to take magnesium glycinate remember we talked about that you want to take at least four to five to six to even up to 800 milligrams for a period of weeks to really fix this deficiency just by taking it one time doesn really help it the problem with magnesium deficiency is that it hard to detect and a lot of people are deficient in it magnesium is really important in a lot of things if you deficient you putting the Magnesium back in there will help the cramp the next thing I want to talk about is when you have swollen feet this usually is involved with diabetes because they have more sugar in the blood and if someone has more sugar they sodium and a lot more water and they going to have puffy feet the antidote is to come up the sugar if you have diabetes another problem that you might have discoloration of the lower leg just the feet start changing colors and they look very unhealthy it could be a circulation problem you can have deep vein thrombosis which is a condition where you and that retention in the foot discoloration in the lower part of the leg and so those clots can come from many different reasons one being high levels of stress and also vitamin E is an antidote to excess clotting because vitamin E kind of thins the blood if you get more pain or more weakness when you exercise suspect something called intermittent claudication and get it checked out from the doctor because that problem and with that problem you get better when you rest next problem is big toe pain right here that usually is a problem with too much uric acid some people even notice if they cut down their oxalates their top pane goes away and that would be like spinach almonds chocolate the antidote to high levels of oxalates whether it stone or whatever is magnesium and prevent the kidney stone situation or the oxalate arthritic situation that some people have other ways that you can diagnose things on your foot if you have an ulcer on the foot that diabetes because you enough oxygen in a diabetic situation if you notice the toes of the feet get destroyed first and then it moves up this way this is why they have to sometimes remove the toes and diabetics completely unnecessary you need that botam and you need to get on a low carb diet but unfortunately you probably won more into managing your symptoms couple things with the nail bed you can look at the nail bed of your toes and tell a lot about your overall health like for example if it could be fungus but it could be jaundice too with the liver but if there fungus that means there your gut and you can fix fungus by adding probiotics and really getting healthy starting with your gut now there like tea tree oil and iodine on the toenail your immune system is weak because you don then the yeast wins and of course yeast lives on sugar so you to get off sugar as well if there funkiness with the toenail like splitting let curving down these are all indicators of not necessarily disease but nutritional deficiencies but in this video I just wanted to give you some insights on how to use your foot as a diagnostic window to other issues and if you want to know more information about the nail beds you should watch this video right here check it out	Success
Eliminate Bloating: The Ultimate Solution by Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdR3gAzCdpU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we behind bloating so you can permanently get rid of bloating when you eat food you chew it it goes through the esophagus it goes down to the stomach where you have a lot of acid and the reason why it is so you can break down proteins and also that acid is going to kill any microbes that are on the food then we have this mixture in the stomach that then ends up in the small intestine where you digest like 90% of the food and you have all sorts of things that are helping you you have the gallbladder which is releasing something called bio to start breaking down the fats but you also have secondary bio salts made by your microbes on the left side of your body you have this thing called the pancreas and that enzymes to help you break down carbohydrates proteins and that you get a lot of breakdown as well as certain microbes in the small intestine and the large intestine help release enzymes I wanted to point that out because 20% of all the enzymes are made by the microbes not to mention then we get certain acids that are created like lactic acid and that lactic acid also helps the microbes Thrive because a lot of the good bacteria thrive in an acid environment what does all this have to do with bloating well bloating is basically some problem in the digestion you can have two people eat the same food and one person bloats and the other person doesn big difference between these two people is the the type and the amount and the diversity of gut bacteria that they have and a lot of your microbial density and the health of your microbes has to do with if you took an antibiotic in your past and how many antibiotics you took in your past the greatest lie about antibiotics is that they do cause a diminishing of your microbes but within weeks they is absolutely a lie if you ever had an antibiotic unfortunately the composition of your microbes have never gone back to the original diversity in the amount let me give you a little more details on the Whiteboard I wanted to show you something really quick here all these different microbes you don need to know or memorize any of these but just realize these are microbes that are normally in your gut the L stands for lactobacillus and then the b stands for bifido bacterium okay so they different typ of microbes after someone has a broad spectrum antibiotic look at the percentage of loss of these microbes 50 to 75% 70 to 90% look at this 99% loss of this microb after you get an antibiotic if you don microbes you contribution they make towards helping you with certain enzymes just take a look at all of these microbes right here and then take a look at how many of these affect your bile and you need bile to help you break down the fats and with this last column right here you can see all the microbes that are involved in decreasing the risk of getting small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and if you going to have bloating but you to have gas you can have burping constipation all sorts of things there other things that mimic antibiotics that you need to be fully aware of and unfortunately that could be the reason why you have bloating so let glyphosate glyphosate it but Monsanto created a patent for glyphosate as an antibiotic because it kills microbes what do you think that microbes if you it and they use three times as much glyphosate on just drying things out like non-GMO stuff so here you are you buy something because is non-mo you think oh this is good yet you even more of this antibiotic other things that can act as an antibi biotic birth control pills steroids like prednisone medications for depression ppis that artificial sweeteners fluoride in the water supply and even Statin medications and I want to bring up one point about antibiotics if you have to take antibiotics I highly recommend that you always at the same time take a probiotic during the time you take the antibiotic and then after because you your microbes so we want to replace them we don bacteria we just want to replace the good bacteria couple other things about antibiotics there that oh you have to take the antibiotic for the full dosage for 7 days or two weeks or 10 days whatever there new data on that that that not true you want to talk with your doctor about this but this new information the new research states that you can take it up to a point where maybe you can stop taking it it could be 3 days because sometimes they scare you like you have to keep taking it for this long period of time that actually creates more of an antibiotic resistance long-term antibiotics it point is we way too long 80% of the antibiotics are sold for livestock and other animals that we eat we lot of antibiotics even people with kidney stones calcium oxalate Stones probably from an antibiotic the probiotic called oxalobacter this microbe that eats oxalates in fact I bought some online I had to get it from Europe but these are probiotics what happens is we take it antibotic it kills off certain microbes like that one and now we end up with high oxalates and it creates damage to our body so many people cannot digest food anymore simply because they don in sufficient quantities the solution to bloating is to take a really good high quality probiotic to put back in what has been missing since you took an antibiotic long ago the other important thing to consume is regular fermented products dairy fermented products and like kefir some high quality yogurt and also fermented vegetables sauerkraut kimchi pickles things like that you have better digestion but you also have something else the majority of microbes in someone asleep one way to wake up dormant microbes is to bring the pH in the right range to make it more acidic and then they will basically come back to life and start working so this is why when you take something like really acidic like kombucha or apple cider vinegar what you lot of dormant microbes and now all these microbes can help to support the bile that you need they can help support the enzymes to break down carbohydrates like fiber and even fats and provide the capacity to take a lot of stress off your pancreas your gallbladder your stomach and your small intestine once you lose these microbes these other organs have to overwork to try to compensate they get tired and you don produce the same amount of enzymes so you end up with all sorts of issues the solution is to put back in your gut the missing microbes and I link down in the description of one that I recommend that may help you	Success

The #1 Anti-aging Hack	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Mb7BIo6hA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	there is a hidden reason why people are aging a lot faster than they should be and this is really important and unfortunately a lot of people are not concerned about aging until they start to age at any age you need to know this if we have too much iron we do not live as long and it deficiency anemia if most of us are deficient in iron and we get it in the diet obviously that should improve it to some degree right on the flip side we accumulating more and more iron there an incredible paper by professor Bruce Ames I which talks about some research that he did in identifying old tissue versus younger tissue as it relates to iron well we have all sorts of amazing systems in the body to protect us against iron iron rusts out our organs if you took something called hydrogen peroxide you probably have it in your medicine chest you take hydrogen peroxide and put it in an open wound and you see it bubbling up and it kills bacteria just think about adding hydrogen oxide to iron it severely reactive that creates a lot of damage within your cells the DNA of the cells the membrane the mitochondria I not drinking hydrogen peroxide so how would that be a problem your body makes hydrogen peroxide not to mention our immune system uses hydrogen peroxide to kill microbes but if that system breaks down all hell breaks loose I think what happens with these anemic kids they have something called dysfunctional iron where iron is locked up to the point where it blood cell so they become anemic yet at the same time they might have too much here we are adding all this iron to the food supply and we doesn things worse too much iron will really put you at risk for Alzheimer Parkinson iron can create a lot of oxidative stress too much oxidation without having the buffer which is the antioxidant networks you can get antioxidants from food and supplements but your body makes antioxidants in fact that important than the antioxidants from the food a lot of people also have chronic infection they get inflammation and then on top of everything the fact that we are getting older and we that we more iron 70% of all your iron is stored in protein in your blood that helps you carry oxygen the hemoglobin storage you can pretty much look at that as a a very large bowl okay that stores iron and then you have fertin which is like a teacup like 10% and fertin is supposed to be inside your tissue where it can protect you against this free Iron and control when it high levels of fertin in the blood recycling your red blood cells every 120 days and it cells and so you have this incredibly efficient recycling system it recycling iron and you have all these different mechanisms and proteins and involved in transporting iron protecting iron because iron can be very reactive and the other problem is your body doesn because certain pathogens microbes can eat iron infections love the iron and they will steal iron for their fuel our bodies don hold this iron and keep it in a safe place and what can happen because of this dysfunctional iron is your poor red blood cells can have way too much iron in the tissue and unfortunately iron increases the growth of cancer and then there people that when they donate blood man do they feel better well that would be a perfect indication that you have too much iron if you don underlying cause you just gave a temporary solution what is the underlying cause there fascinating information that talks about copper copper is a very very important Trace mineral if you have too much iron and N enough copper this is a big problem but before you start taking copper I recommend you start to limit the amount of iron you would never take any supplement with iron at all this is in the flower products it in a lot of refined carbohydrates what foods are high in Copper shellfish organ Meats like beef liver if you don those Foods sunflower seeds do have a good amount of copper even dark chocolate has some copper just make sure you don of sugar how do we make sure our bodies are producing enough antioxidants to counter some some of this oxidative stress to illustrate this I want to explain a personal thing that happened to me recently there test that you can do on your body it called a metabolomic test I was doing this test like very frequently like once every two weeks and what was really interesting about this it kept showing high levels of oxidative stress I that I realized what it was I was exercising like crazy and exercise produces a tremendous amount of oxid of stress as well as hydrogen peroxide what I personally needed to do to counter that is to build up my antioxidant reserve and to do that I needed more glutamine which is an amino acid you can get the most glutamine from red meat and then I R tested myself and it was much much better the point was there of things that can increase the need for more antioxidant help alcohol smoking pollution junk Foods when we think about antioxidants I always thinking about like vitamin C and vitamin E which are really important and you should definitely get those in your diet but with your own antioxidant networks protein is probably the most important thing this is why it consume enough protein as you get older and this is one reason why I don encourage people to be vegans because it protein I have a really good friend who is a foot surgeon and she told me every time she does surgery she notices the muscles just are not pink they red they probably anemia the problem with vegans is they have to take an iron supplement and they and heem iron only comes from animal products like meat and I not to be a vegan or vegetarian I saying it things that help build up your antioxidants too now I already mentioned copper but zinc and manganese these are trace minerals that can come from shellfish Seafood things like that magnesium and selenium which is another Trace mineral what are some other things you can do to get this iron out of your tissues that go beyond avoiding iron and building up your internal antioxidant networks one is coratin one of the best sources of coratin is onions curcumin from turmeric is a good one too increasing your melatonin can be very very therapeutic I have a whole video on this I the best sources of melatonin is infrared over 50% of the Rays of the sun is infrared infrared increases melatonin and melatonin can help you regulate iron also anything with tannins like black tea would be great but the most powerful key later for iron is called lacto ferin you can get it when you consume raw milk or raw milk cheese because it that can help you decrease iron in your cells you can also get it as a supplement as well the next time you get your blood test make sure they include fertin you want that number as low to zero as possible I hope I put this on your radar enough for you to really do these action steps that I mentioned so thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video	Success
Why Do Most Indian Men Have Potbellies?!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so why do most Indian men have pot bellies now I have done another video on this previously but I have some new information that goes beyond just eating too many carbs so to get more accurate information about this topic I bringing on Dr rashne Who is an endocrinologist that actually lives in India doc thanks for coming on I I wanted to just say hello and uh good to see you again yes thanks for having me Dr Eric it and be in touch again yeah I wanted to really talk about what especially related to belly fat and I know it world but especially in India for several reasons I did a video on this before and uh this is kind of a part two because there information after talking with you that I found out that I think I want to share that goes a little bit beyond just lowering your carbohydrates trying to lose weight so we that as well I think you were you were born in the US but then you lived half of your life in India you treat people as a medical doctor and as an endocrinologist so I have someone who actually can give me firsthand knowledge of what in India so can you just kind of give people an overview of the type of health problems that are we India of having uh protruded bellies oh yes there Dr Eric um you know it longer you know type 2 diabetes is obviously something that comes into our world a lot as endocrinologists um we deal with sure you know PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome uh we deal now with seeing younger and younger people getting sick from insulin resistance even people who shouldn insulin resistance we think of someone with type 1 diabetes we see them getting insulin resistance so India is not IM imune to what the rest of the world is seeing we have little children now it there are some states in India that have one in three children with highy tri glycerides and fatty liver already on sonography and the protruding belly is hitting these young children right from when they could be nature part of it could be genetic tendency but a lot of it if you take it in the right way is good news it have control over in terms of our lifestyle and our choices but a lot of Lifestyle Changes are coming in where insulin resistance protruding bellies we diabetes metabolic crisis in India is exploding we may not be the most obese country in the world but we in the top five in terms of Maximum cases of type two diabetes as well as cardiometabolic so early cardiac issues you know I one question about that because you know just to keep this really simple I think I but but they might not when you eat carbohydrates in excess amounts it triggers a hormone called insulin and then insulin is the hormone that not only stores fat but it prevents you from burning fat okay so that is but here through medical school then you studied Endocrinology when a doctor goes through this intensive medical training especially on insulin which is the main hormone but somehow it gets kind of disconnected when you get into the carbohydrate triggering insulin and I mean it back now and look at it like okay so if you have too much fat obviously you have too much insulin but in medical school I don happens when someone is taught that and as far as an average medical doctor that or an average endocrinologist and somehow they don lowering your carb oh yes yeah you know that understand where did my my basics of first year of medical school from biochemistry where carbohydrate was the food group that triggers the maximum insulin response or the maximum insulin requirement you know there was a disconnect from learning that in first year of medical school till the time we came to second year where we were studying pharmacology already there was a disconnect where we were memorizing the types of insulin the NPH the quick acting the long acting the newer molecules how to prescribe them and then in third year medical school we went into internal medicine and we had Harrison little time spent on the lifestyle aspect and much more time spent on the prescription aspect whether it was the presence of pharmaceutical representatives in our clinics you know funding or doing these little reminders of what to prescribe there was very little time or energy in my medical school training for nutrition Beyond the first year and then MD medicine Internal Medicine in the hospital you know people who are sick and admitted they enough to be admitted to hospital really the con the concept of doing lifestyle discussion or nutrition discussion wasn way it sounds bad but here who lying in a hospital bed getting Hospital trays it time to talk about nutrition or carbohydrates they the plate and then went into Fellowship to become an endocrinologist an insulin specialist right and I but I how to change nutrition so this is mind-blowing because I went through Premed but I didn Chiropractic College there enough time to really learn the information I had to past the test I had to memorize and get on to the next test because there being crammed down our throats and then but you don let me apply apply this Theory and and also how can we use this information practically it so I guess what you you information but then there disconnect on the diet part or the food part a big disconnect a big disconnect or the nutrition part yeah I wouldn say that doctors were getting hardcore or thorough nutrition training I wouldn point when you Gra graduated you going out there just doing what you were taught there must have been a shift can you tell us what happened at that point yes so um I I noticed you know when I was an endocrine fellow that we as fellows in training would run around run around one side of the corridor running into the patient rooms to do the consults and then talk to our senior doctors and get the sign off on the medication changes we wanted to make and one of the prescriptions we would write along with the insulin or the medications for diabetes for example uh was go to this diabetes class and I was like well that class and it Corridor luckily for me it was on the same campus in the same building and so as I was graduating I got you know permission to go and sit in on some of these classes by the diabetes Educators because I was curious about the behavioral elements and what are they teaching over there that might be useful to my patient that I them to take out time and come again to take this educational course so I didn I was having a bit of fomo like I didn want to miss out on what was being said so that was my first exposure to the impact of nutrition and you know Dr Berg it had blinders on because endocrinologists are the most trained doctors when it comes to treating people with type 1 diabetes when I have to prescribe insulin for someone right and over there we carbohydrate ratio which means for how many grams of carbohydrate how many grams of insulin am I trying to give this patient and I teach the patient that is how much they need to be injected for that meal and yet this knowledge stayed there and it didn come out until much later when I was like wait a minute that formula if I lower the carbs I lower the insulin it was right in front of my face God okay I mean same thing like if you right they have to take insulin because they don regulate the sugars because insulin lowers the blood sugar so obviously this is the amount of insulin you take is depending on how much carbohydrate you eat what you information just did not quite sink in right away it didn of my career it just stayed in this place and so in type one when I was walk working with someone I would say hey if you don you this bit of a belly you know you started out normal weight a lot of people start out normal weight and then the higher the insulin dose goes in type one they start gaining weight um and so we would say well if you reduce your carbs we going to have to give you less insulin so that was an obvious thing there but it just didn my career until later where a series of events when I decided to move from the United States to India that bulb went on is you know I love these classes that my patients are getting in Chicago and I want to learn that so I can carry the educational material to India I don insulin prescribing uh knowledge and Medicine prescribing I want to know the education piece because I felt like that would connect me to the culture in India if I did the education myself I would listen I would hear I would understand what been out of India for 10 years and so I wanted to use the educator hat to connect back with my my culture through those listening experiences I started hearing what was going on with people that that really started in 2011 and by 2013 I was just making a lot of progress with helping people realize that if they want to avoid more medicines or getting on to insulin in type two diabetes we had to show them the relationship between carbohydrates and the insulin that was giving them this gaining of belly and all this weight gain in the wrong areas wow okay so fast forward you carbohydrates there carbohydrates in the world but definitely I think and when you go to a restaurant you have different cultural festivals you have everything kind of revolves around carbohydrates what are the top carbs that the Indians eat I can how about I walk you through breakfast lunch dinner like that is that okay so what is considered a light breakfast because we by the low fat low calorie um unfortunate messaging that went around probably from the 1970s India has been listening to that and has been badly affected by trying to do a calorie or a lowfat approach so they think low fat or light breakfast is preferred which ends up being a lot of carbohydrates so breakfast options include um idly Dosa Opa poha some people might do like a if you do a parata or like a piece of bread or a Roy if you state which is Gujarat you might do like a spicy kind of a bread like a tapel some people love to have tapel these are some common breakfast items if you might do corn flakes or you might do mu and you might do juice some people will do a bowl of fruit some people are told in India stay with only fruit in the first half of the day so they on their fruits in the morning or they then they of power power that walk again these are all carbohydrates all processed and refined some of them sugar oats people have taken to reading and hearing that oats are heart healthy and that same messaging has been in India as well so they might do instant quick cooking oats and then they might do versions of that where they do oats Opa or oats idly so they think that by adding the oats into the other Indian dishes they something better than just the rice or the wheat so that breakfast and I probably missed two I probably miss missed some yeah if we go to lunch you and some people do a midm morning snack again if they have been told to have a fruit as a midm morning snack if you do that breakfast one and a half hours later you to need a snack because it put you in a state of hunger yes because of that big insulin spike in the morning and you and this is the classic pattern I see is small frequent meals hungry all day cannot go more than 3 hours 4 hours without feeling hungry and wanting something Cravings a lot of Cravings um lunch typically is either Roy or rice some people if they health conscious they may be switching from wheat they may be switching to millets and the government of India is you know trying to actually promote more Millet usage I it would be a whole grain where you can actually see the Millet but a lot of these have been pulverized into a powder and they or you know again Roy or flatbread made from flowers um so you processing to these grains or millets so you have some form of a flatbread or rice with a side of maybe a vegetable or a doll if you carrying lunch from home one good thing that I still see in India is a lot of people carry lunch from home but we have a very hot climate so someone who cooking for you in the morning or you cooking your own lunch and carrying it in lunch usually you don something very liquidy or that to spill or leak or go bad so it might be more on the dry side so you end up not having a lot of protein in these lunches very commonly if you careful you deficient at lunch as well there basically maybe a grain or a processed grain and some vegetable maybe if you eat animal protein you have a small amount of animal protein at lunch and then is there a mid-afternoon snack oh yeah so again this is where a lot of hunger pangs hit people I give a survey to all of my patients when they come in like an intake form and so many people mark off that 5:00 is the worst 4:00 is the worst so we have a chai culture in India where we love our chai and so the afternoon or you know mid evening early evening 4:00 3:00 chai a lot of people want to have some dry crunchy munchy snacks again these may be uh light because they like baked and roasted and not versus fried so people think it this could be puffed rice it could be um Millet flakes Millet chips um a lot of these crunchy snacky things that people want maybe if you healthy you might do a fruit and then for dinner for dinner again um not everybody prioritizes protein at dinner sometimes if again I know them the most again highly vegetarian by preference and by culture so dinner they don bread and like the flatbread and the vegetable and the dll combo they want variety at night so they might do a variation of a pizza or a pasta or a lasagna or a Mexican dish you know I going to use some Indian words here cuz you know this is for them is like Raga pattis which is Al lentil soup and potato fritters you could call them we so if we take a look at a carbohydrate I think there what a carbohydrate is because it just one thing it things to keep it simple you have fiber that which is a carbohydrate but there third thing if you deduct the fiber and the sugar there left and this is what I think people don that is and that would be a starch and and what is a starch starch is a bunch of sugar it hidden sugar especially if the way that they process it around the world so if you you know we talk about how much sugar an actual person is consuming it a lot per day but if we include the starches and we look at the percentage of calories of combined carbohydrates and that looking at what is it 60 70 maybe even 80% or more of their calories are carbs right unfortunately yes especially if you met someone who lowering your carbs your default Indian choices are going to be more than half carbs wow how can someone start lowering their carb because obviously we need to reduce insulin to solve this problem live in India and actually do this and actually maintain a vegetarian lifestyle we want to talk about that there second problem that you these foods do to our digestive system like we get a lot of bloating and it going to make you look like you pregnant you belly do you see that in your practice people coming in with distended stomachs every day Dr Burg every day and again in that intake form because I Internal Medicine base always and then an endocrinologist after so I ask about all the organ systems because I want to look at you as a whole so I about dig digestive symptoms and we did a little analysis of our practice and I was surprised that the topmost complaint people had when they came in was digestive complaints and I was like I not a gastroenterologist but they suffering from this the good news was even though they came in with the gas the bloating the you know distended belly it would go in and out 2 three inches depending on what they ate we been able to sort of crack how to help them see that phenomenon change just by working on their food the problem is and I of your patients are on antibiotics or ppis and it just gets worse and worse and worse so then what happens is you get this overgrowth right of all this candida and stuff and now we situation where if they just eat a little bit of fiber they feel like there stomach a human or an animal or even an insect will continue to eat until they satisfy their protein requirements so do you see this in your practice every day I see people again not satiated from their meals wanting something more sometimes they describe this as Cravings sweet Cravings they sometime somehow they want more sugar and sweet and I suspect it they still looking for that energy somehow and protein should used forgy but there misinterpreted asting to seek out sugar and when you insulin that we talked about adding more sugar just keeps you really stuck in this same vicious cycle but I doing diet recalls for my patients and counting their nutrition since 2011 myself because I was you know the educator for my patients since 2011 and in India I see people coming in when they first see me most of them are less than 5050 gram of protein per day and a very large majority of them are getting less than 25 grams 25 grams of protein per day this is interesting because when someone gets enough protein they going to be satisfied and the likelihood of them snacking and like if they went on a low carb diet now without satisfying the protein it really hard to fix that problem exactly because you hungry all the time and you them to reduce their carbohydrates but then right so so like how are they going to be satisfied right yeah right exactly so what I process is yes they carbohydrates but that using to sort of almost like mechanically fill the stomach with something and feel that stretch and you know it interesting because I think this is the origin of the myth that happens in India or circulates in India is that protein is heavy and I they say protein is heavy what what they haven is supposed to feel like it to fill you up and so when we increase the protein they start feeling full and they finally like oh I more the thing that turned me around cuz I used to live on pure carbs huge muffin for breakfast and cereal and I would do that it took me until 11:00 in the morning until I can wake up mentally and then one day I started having protein for breakfast and boy that was like a miracle I can actually wake up how does someone being a vegetarian increase the amount of protein to start the day off right yes this is again something we trying to solve for every day in practice and we because it got so much content out uh for your audience about how if you are okay with animal protein it to get your protein to happen at each meal but the unique problem is for someone who vegetarian within India there are some vegetarians who are okay with eggs and there are some who will not even go near eggs just it belief systems and I cannot even get them to take eggs which would be a really good quality whole protein for them um so many vegetarians in India are okay with dairy and so we use that a lot let types of foods that they can have related to Dairy right and you know Dr Berg one of the things I the um habit friction so I kind of look at what they they don their grocery list and do something out of the way that their running kitchen India is a lot of large families living Under One Roof a lot of different tastes and preferences a lot of actively running kitchens all day long so the idea is to not shut down the cooking system that start with baby steps I know what would be ideal is to get these people to 1.2 Gams of protein at least per kg body weight per day every day but sometimes I have to start with if I to 80 or 90 or 100 grams of protein but I make this 30 how can we from your existing menu so I they have I have I with some natural carbohydrates and I make them use my app and I I made my own app because the existing apps out there they do a lot of calorie counting and as an endocrinologist you know we want them to focus on carbs and proteins and the hormonal basis for why their bellies coming out and not the calorie way because just reducing calories just hasn with Indian foods and me and my team have counted out each food and we keep adding new things to the to the back end to show you your carbs and proteins so we start to see where you are on your carbs for the day where you are on the proteins for the day let can start dialing your existing proteins up so that means if you took legumes double them if you took these carbs can you have them and that easiest way for me to get them started and so obviously we have the yogurt do you do kefir as well it a bit of a almost like a privileged uh food here it everywhere so I wouldn something that the masses of India are going to be able to access it the very healthc conscious big cities in the refrigerators okay so then we talking about like uh yogurt and then uh cheese yes they yogurt they do homemade Indian paneer cheese which is like the fresh you split the milk curdle the milk and you get this fresh paneer I can get by with a meal with um and do just fine with cheese so cheese I do a lot of cheese in my diet and that Source too because the when you have cheese that is fermented it eats up a lot of the milk sugar then sure you can sneak in some nuts and seeds and nut Butters but if you know we per kilo body weight without adding a protein supplement you know and people will say you know oh you should avoid powders and you should avoid processed food and I agree but in a world where we touching ing processed carbohydrates anyway you touching packaged you know shelf stable things that are just not fresh they like instant eat there no cooking required if we processed maybe this is the one Vice is to take a protein supplement and from all of those whey is really not that processed if you think about it it just dehydrated liquid from when you split the milk out and get the solids out the liquid is the way so that would be the Le processed it complete protein as well so I think that let amount of their protein from whey I guess it would listed on the label how much they would need but I don you have any simple ways that would they yeah so one scoop gives you the typical way the packaging comes here one scoop gives you about 25 grams and so the way I ask to do the math here is if I given them a target of 1.2 let a 60 kg person we gram I usually go on the higher end of estimating for them because they plant-based it availability of these is a bit on the Lower Side 1.2 and then I throw in an extra five or 10 just to make an easy number so 75 so 75 I can divide that easily 25 25 25 breakfast lunch and dinner might be that you need the Whey Protein scoop if you find that when you do your math for the day is you know what you you lentils you know you some paneer some soft fresh cheese you do the math or some people have started plugging it into my app as they plan the day is oh that so I do a scoop or a scoop and a half of the protein shake by starting with the protein you satisfied if someone eggs how many eggs cuz some people are concerned about cholesterol right so why don there are days Dr Bur that I eat eight or 10 eggs a day if I if I haven thought about what to eat or what to make or cook I just easier let me just do the eggs right and there dietary cholesterol raises the bad cholesterol this is a myth that even the American Heart Association has come out and backed off from saying it was sort of bad information told to us in the 70s and it just really stuck so I have to reassure them is it we to look at other things to make sure you oh that they have a lot of let like that is that an option or no it is again I would say that it taste in India tofu versus paneer it texturally different the flavor is different um I love tofu because of the profile it has in terms of carbs and um proteins um so we have a lot of tofu in our house it that if you can be expensive so if you there are indian-made and India actually produces quite a bit of soy soybeans and a colleague of mine told me that India does non- GMO soybeans and so if you can get local Indian made too it up in popularity now so you Tempe now in India as well and the Indians are really into their spice so you get ready to eat um Tempe that been flavored and seasoned with like Indian spice profiles so that they can hide the taste of the Tempe because that the big cities do have tofu and Tempe so let I know one of the great things about India is the spices and you have turmeric for example that help with bloating help with digestion and so that probably offsets some of the things I know even in America when you go to an Indian restaurant they they will give you some some spices after of course it you some with the bloating is there a common spice that Indians use after they eat every kitchen starts with turmeric every meal has turmeric every day there turmeric every day but we still have digestive problems we have cumin in almost everyday cooking there community within India that won onions and garlic they they have religious beliefs around that you did mention about the antibiotics and ppis the the good and bad about India is these things are available over the counter so people wow yeah people self-prescribed self-prescribed wow I think what happening especially that you just told me that information if someone has taken an antibiotic sometime in their life now you that are going to help you digest and so over time now you can you those microbes need to be replaced another thing that that we want to talk about is like fermented foods are there fermented foods in India yes the ones I prescribe are some somewhat imported in the sense that they come from other cultures like the sauerkraut Keir or the kimchi in terms of Indian fermented foods there are some but again they tend to be on the spicy side so the fermented yogurt is one like there beverage that a lot of Indians will have after the meal which is yogurt in water so diluted yogurt shaken up in water and they maybe some spices in there and they drink it like a digestive after their meals when we talk about starches you know people think oh potatoes but that not what modified corn starch Mt dextrin modified food starch let how that can eliminating those foods can majorly help with the bloating we have to teach our our patients you know we do a lot of label reading classes with them where we show them how to look for these hidden ingredients is they understanding the the the technical words you know it a starch you know it pasta or it but these you know strange long words we have to make them understand how to find those and even the way a starch hits you you know this is one of my sort of arguments is sure every culture has its traditional wisdom and we have our traditional millet and our traditional grains and our non-GMO wheat that around for many centuries and people want to talk about oh but we what our ancestors ate the thing is when you powder these grains you that starch that was in the middle of it you know the starch was meant for that little seed to go in the soil and in the dark where there was no sunlight to be able to make some energy for this Little Chute so that it could poke enough energy out and get those little leaves up to start the photosynthesis and get energy from the Sun so that starch was meant to be given at a specific time to this plant underground we crushed it to a level fine powder and we and it me oh proteins are difficult to digest and I think what they is exactly what you described is the starches are hitting them first the good bacteria in their bodies have been destroyed out by some lifestyle choices by medications and then they to pop some Prebiotic probiotic supplements and so they endless cycle of you know medications and just not getting better are you doing grain based are you doing plant-based and then also like raw vegetables a big part of the of an Indian diet or is it just cooked vegetables some cultures do a lot of salad you know small quantities of just fresh freshly chopped really her herbaceous you know lovely light seasonings like cilantro mint we do have lovely herbs that you get it country you know there availability of greens like that micro greens are becoming popular here and some of the foods will be cooked now there there is a spectrum here like sometimes it gap where people My Generation want their vegetables Al Dente like where there it want their vegetables cooked into a mush almost like it no chewing required yeah yeah that take some of the spinach and you just pulverize it to to nothing that another thing like I think could help people with their digestion is having like more salad than the grains that can help with the bloating as well yes so we tell people go up on the fresh vegetables go down on the grains for sure but it is after we first agenda in any consult is to up the protein first there are times where I have to tell people look I can progress with you in your metabolic goals until we get that protein to happen at each meal so here I sort of really make it accessible to you is instead of saying reduce your carbs cuz people are like I they they don carbs right they food I eating my traditional Indian diet so I have to say okay let your rice your U barata so I list out the Indian words for these carbohydrate predominant meals Opa poha kakura Etc these long Indian names you know and let they because most people have enough room for me to say just double your protein because they even if I double they anywhere near excess yeah this is It tricky problem because I know in America we have a lot less uh vegetarians and vegans so you know we can recommend certain animal Meats but not not in other cultures the trick is okay how do we how do we do this to lower the carbs I think you with the protein because that make it easy to do or a lot easier it going to be much harder so I always do the protein conversation first so I not taking a hungry person who with the two Roes or the one and 1/2 cups of rice let two chapatis or Roes breads flatbreads or you know two cups of rice let make a number they vegetables and they legumes lentil soup doll I will say can you cut the Roti under rice to 50% and can you double the vegetables and the do two cups of those and two cups of those can you do that and they was like you want that right you don want to be hungry all day so when we do the increase in the vegetables and the proteins they themselves are able to then self taper the carbs and in India again more and more people are getting exposed to the idea of wearing a CGM a continuous glucose monitor which is a little wearable chip it can wear for two weeks and when they wear that they can see what happens with their carbohydrate intake how their glucose levels are spiking and then we have them run the experiment to see you had two servings of this grain your glucose spiked up tomorrow I want you to try that and why don and then tomorrow see what happens then it them and their body having a conversation this is amazing so um for those of you that need to work with a very competent physician I I want to put your link down below where they can get a hold of you and they can learn more about your website and your in your program because there out there that are on medications that need assistance that this is a new thing for them and I know that you have several programs amazing book as well that I halfway through it which is filled with just gold information so I put those links down below but it a pleasure uh discussing these topics and I think there for people to start implementing on a regular basis and uh I think if people could just try this they find that it I doctor especially an endocrinologist that is primarily focus on someone because that rare yes yes today we talked all about food and it definitely the first step to helping the body do its thing yeah exactly thanks so much doc I really appreciate your time thank you Dr Burke	Success
The Earliest Warning Sign (DON'T IGNORE)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q	Dr. Eric Berg DC	the number one early sign of dementia you fact I just recently found out about it and this involves everyone especially if you want to prevent the different types of dementia Alzheimer people know that the first symptom of a heart attack over 50% of the time is death because there is no symptom and the same thing with the liver there really is no symptoms until the later stages when sometimes it guess what the brain is the same thing it takes decades to develop dementia and in the meantime there symptoms except one which I discuss and this is because the different organs especially the brain just keep compensating over a period of time until they can and so the earliest sign of dementia involves the retina it that is literally sticking out of your skull in your eye socket the retina has certain cells that pick up information from the environment and allows you to see and so they found a very large correlation between in the retina and problems in the brain specifically with the outer layer of the retina and then you have all sorts of issues with the eye itself problems with night vision problems with central vision floaters light sensitivity issues and a lot of times people will just you know get a new set of glasses and they may even develop something called amalo beta plaing on the retina itself at the end of the video and also in the description I information up you also might notice problems with detecting different Shades of Gray or even differentiate different colors as well they also evaluated cadavers brains and so they evaluated the retina with people with cognitive deficit like a mild version of dementia and you start having more inflammation in the nervous system and then things start to go downhill after that and another really interesting thing about the brains of Alzheimer they found high levels of a certain microbe that happens to be living in your teeth it they the brain if someone has a dental infection or some type of periodontal disease you could be leaking out bacteria that goes into bloodstream that ends up in the brain I mean we also found Dental bacteria in the plaing of our heart as well I have a very important new solution for all of this but I just want to take a moment to just explain why people actually die from dementia it an infection a UTI or maybe lung infection or in the case of my mother-in-law who had Alzheimer a surgery it created so much stress in the body and after that things just start going down and down a lot faster on the other hand sometimes you have a slow Progressive degeneration of the brain to the point where a person is in hospice and they they just stop eating and stop drinking and then that talk about what we can do about this and one of the most important things that you should focus on is cleaning your brain if you have a lot of inflammation and plaing in the brain it can really look at this as like a dishwasher and they call it the glymphatic system that cleans the brain mainly at night that purposes of sleeping is to be able to detoxify and clean the brain so you wake up and things are cleaned out and what I mean by clean the brain is pull out some of these malformed proteins and the plaing and rejuvenate the brain anything that inhibits sleeping increases your risk for Alzheimer that inhibits your sleeping less than 6 hours increases your risk for heart attacks Strokes cancer blood sugar issues type two diabetes and so if you have sleep apnea that is a problem and if you have sleep apnea I a link down below of what to do about it and you need to get eight or nine hours and this is based on a book why we sleep by Dr Matthew Walker fascinating book even one night of less than seven hours of sleep you buildup of amalo beta plaing how do we get more sleep and another factor in getting quality sleep is the avoidance of alcohol one cup of alcohol prevents a significant part of your REM sleep you might feel like you it the quality of sleep if you several times a week this could be a huge problem with the quality of sleep and also in the prevention of Alzheimer hormone by 50% it hormone it helps you lose weight alcohol is really bad for your brain and we want to flood the brain with a lot of oxygen how do we get oxygen in the brain exercise regular consistent exercise hands down is one of the most important things to do to prevent Alzheimer other types of dementia people who are sedentary do not get the oxygen in the brain getting oxygen to the brain lessens something called hypoxia that a word that describes lack of oxygen and with hypoxia you get inflammation when you exercise you make the brain healthier you grow brain cells and you stimulate something called bdnf brain derived neurotrophic Factor that Miracle Grow for your brain and there also a tiny little mechanism deep in the brain that regulates the rhythm of your sleep it supermatic nucleus not that you need to know that name but that that thing is so important to regulate the sleep cycles a couple ways to get that working is during the daylight get a lot of sun and then start to go to bed when it gets dark vitamin D in higher amounts can reset that mechanism I would recommend taking about 20,000 international units of vitamin D and then there the brain if you carbohydrates and sugar you create a starvation on the nerve cells you really want to put your brain in a state of ketosis the brain cells love ketones how do you get into ketosis you lower your carbohydrate if you have signs of dementia I would highly recommend that you take ketones as a supplement and you also take on a regular basis MCT oil because MCT oil can turn into ketones and feed the brain directly we want to flood that brain with a lot of ketones as far as nutrition goes I think out of all the nutrients nasin is going to be very important for the brain I would start up maybe with 50 milligrams for a period of time then go to 100 milligrams per day and then eventually up to 500 milligrams per day you got to do it slowly because some people can response I kind of like the flushing response it create a vas or dilation effect since we to take your sleep to the next level you should watch this video right here check it out	Success
The #1 Vitamin Depleting Food in the World	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw21AZN7Ulc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we one vitamin depleting food in the world can you guess what it is if you answered refine starches you because the answer is actually not sugar if we look at how much a sugar depletes you of certain nutrients a starch will deplete you way more than a sugar we talking about refined rice flour tapioca flour corn flour modified corn starch molto dextrin and modified food starch in order to process or metabolize or break down a refined starch and turn it into energy it requires certain nutrients one of the big nutrients that is needed to metabolize starches is vitamin B1 tham another question that you might have is why is a starch worse than a sugar as far as depleting nutrients a person consumes much less sugar than starch in their given diet an average person consumes about 50 lbs of sugar per year an average person consumes almost 300 lb of starch per year on the glycemic index refined starches are much much higher than sugar what is the glycemic index it measurement or a scale of how fast a food or a carbohydrate can turn into glucose or raise your blood sugar if we compare sugar to starches sugar is about 74 m Al textr is like 180 and those refined starches jack up your blood sugar way faster one of the really important nutrients that vitamin B1 thymine couple things you need to know about thyine we don a lot of it I mean like in our entire body we might store 30 milligrams the rdas for B1 which were established like 80 or 100 years ago have never been changed it do you realize how tiny that is from my viewpoint that is like way way way too low doctors never checked for a vitamin B1 deficiency what are the symptoms of the B1 deficiency Beyond fatigue is problems with your GI system your digestion you might get slow digestion floating maybe a little constipation feeling nauseous because so many parts of the digestion need be one you not going to make enough stomach acid can the liver just going to get a lack of digestion another common symptom with a B1 deficiency is stress nervous tension solving problems especially when you trying to get to sleep this is why a B1 deficiency creates insomnia you not going to sleep that good as this deficiency gets worse you notice a personality changes mood swings more frequently if you relationship with someone and they just like flap the handle with no reason and they vitamin B1 deficiency how many children have that purely because they too many refined starches they need a lot of B1 women that are pregnant are more susceptible to a B1 deficiency one of the big symptoms that they get right off the bat is feeling nauseous if you yourself are pregnant or you know someone who nauseous make sure they take more B1 because also that infant needs B1 too especially in the early years and infants they can have what horse cry they voice comes out muscle twitches Can Get Enough air your breathing is going to be off I wonder how many people with sleep apnea just have a vitamin B1 deficiency all the starch that comes in the body that breaks down in the glucose it can converted to lactic acid which shuts down the oxygen it makes the body more acidic which is going to affect the breathing and you might be even hyperventilating to try to push out more CO2 to balance this acidity this could be one of the reasons why people can sleep and muscle and the muscles they going to get Restless like syndrome another thing like diabetics I would say nearly 100% of all diabetics are deficient of B1 because they have high sugar in the blood constantly demanding a lot of B1 the form that I recommend is something called Bentham it specialized type of B1 if someone is really really deficient in B1 they literally can be psychotic they can also have another symptom called confabulation which I had to look that up that means a production of memories which are are false off from a severe vitamin B1 deficiency other things will exaggerate a B1 deficiency alcohol tea coffee raw fish as in sushi having certain digestive inflammatory issues with your gut where you can certain things taking met ormon can create a deficiency exercising a lot increases the demand for vitamin B1 you think about how many athletes are using molto dextrin as an energy source but without B1 and on top of that they exercising like crazy what are some foods high in B1 Whole Foods you can get B1 in meat in fact the meat that has the highest source of B1 is actually pork neat liver has B1 eggs have B1 sunflower seeds have B1 sometimes you refined grains are a good source of B vitamins that adding them in there through the fortification process I definitely don recommend taking a synthetic B1 product I recommend taking a natural B1 the name of the natural B1 is called called Ali thyine and it lot of nerve issues it bioavailable source of B1 I have a lot of it is in B1 but I need to get to the next nutrient that when you consume these starches and that is magnesium magnesium is another co-actor involved in this whole process going from starches to energy what really interesting about magnesium is it you don what B1 can vitamin D won that magnesium does is it helps control calcium calcium typically causes contraction of the muscle if there enough magnesium you more contraction of the muscle what do you call that a charlie horse muscle spasm which usually occurs in the early morning because that lowest point of magnesium magnesium is important in regulating calcium because if there place you can get a lot of problems calcium that builds up the arteries kidney stones magnesium is so important with all that without magnesium you tend to have higher blood pressure palpitations just a lot of problems with the heart just think about the medication is called a calcium channel blocker well they effects of magnesium because there much calcium that if you don cortisol goes up and then you can sleep this is why a lot of people take magnesium before bed the type of magnesium I would recommend is magnesium glycate if you magnesium you can get Tremors muscle weakness migraines you can vitamin D without magnesium so that important yes you can start taking these nutrients to allow you to digest the starch but a better thing would be to avoid refined starches for more information about these starches you should watch this video right here check it out now	Success

Viral Health Tips You Need to STOP Now	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today I hacks and other forms of treatment and number 10 is the absolute worst and it not even a health hack it treatment that basically generates $280 million a year it doesn work and it in number one ear candling there are people out there who believe that when you light one end of this candle it actually heats up your ear wax and it creates a suction effect to pull that wax out of your ear canal and Pull It in to the candle I even tried ear candles a long ago when I was in practice and I got my wife to do it I got my parents to do it I got some patients to do it because if you look at the pictures it looks like it really works you sucking this wax out of your ear because combining the heat of the candle and as it burns down it creates a vacuum and sucks all this wax out and you can actually see it but are you really looking at the wax out of your ear I watched a great video by a doctor of Audiology who performed an experiment to look inside the ear before and after using these ear candles and he found there and after the treatment of removing wax from your ears so apparently that wax is the wax from the candle you might want to save your money on that one number two this one is a gallbladder flush I did this one too and it almost killed me what you drink 12 oz of olive oil then you going to chase it down with these beet tablets I made the big mistake of washing down the Beet tablets with the olive oil and the B tablets solidified in my esophagus I almost stopped breathing I literally got really really scared I do not recommend this you see these videos that they the toilet these huge gall stones here the thing they stones don people are looking at are little pools of bile that you just purged and now you especially if you fats I highly recommend you don purge your gallbladder a much better way of dissolving or preventing gallstones or preventing that sludge which is the formation of a gallstone is to actually take more bile and a good bile to take to help dissolve it is something called tadka take tutka on an empty stomach take two in the morning two in the afternoon that opens up and gets things to drain but if you want to add more to help dissolve a gallstone you want to start taking bile salts after the meal to help prevent the formation of stones and then keep the slow LGE from turning into a gallstone I do not recommend purging or flushing gallstones by drinking a tremendous amount of olive oil number three the master cleanse were you pepper and maple syrup and yes I did this long ago having this idea that I going to cleanse and Purge all these toxins in my liver that way to cleanse it create a lot of blood sugar issues because if you 3 days like I did it I ate nothing I drank Nothing But a G gallon of this mixture every single day the sugar in the maple syrup kept me from converting into ketosis and kept me in the sugar burning mode where my blood sugars were up and down up and down I was like craving sugar throughout the day for three days a much better way to do a cleanse would be to just eat healthy foods especially maybe cruciferous foods to provide the enzymes for the liver to slowly detoxify chemicals throughout the body number four those foot detox pads this is a waste of money it you bought these pads I bought them you put them on your feet in the hopes of pulling out poisons and heavy metals because if you wear them for a period of time and you take them off they black right so that it can just pour water on them and then watch them turn black they pulling toxins out of your body there no detox Pathways in your skin you sweat Through Your Skin but sweating is not necessarily A detoxification it to release excess sodium and also water so you can actually cool the body down because it refrigeration action externally on your skin to get rid of excess heat when these pads have certain herbs or certain things on them it is not creating a magnet for metals and that leads us to number five the foot detox bath go to a clinic you put your feet in these things and it has a certain electrode in there that then generates some current in the water and then all of a sudden the water solution becomes like this brown toxic material it metals out all this toxic waste from your kidneys and your liver so you could become very clean right wrong that what toxins out you can actually create the same color in this bath without putting your feet in it what you interacting with the electrodes to create rust it that has nothing to do with toxins coming out of your body my wife and I were in the Dominican Republic and we did a vacation and they had this little place where you can put your feet into these tiny little minnows that will eat the dead skin cells off of your feet so your feet are really smooth after my wife and I did this and it tickled when they were eating or nibbling on our feet but I will say it did not make our feet really nice and smooth I guess you have to probably put some piranhas in there to do that because these little minnows just didn our feet number six the ab belts there two different versions so you have the belt that causes more sweating in your midsection and then you have the belt that creates this electric stimulation like it has like a tense unit where it creating this contraction on your stomach muscles because of course wouldn exercise and you can just wear this belt all day and then at the end of the day you pop it off and you have this these six-pack abs sorry this one also is not going to work creating stimulation on your stomach muscles or even sweating is not going to remove any fat F from your midsection and creating the stimulation without you doing the work is not going to help you with your midsection I sorry to tell you that most of that internal fat called visceral fat has to be removed through diet and there are also various toning things that you can do to tighten some of the the fascia around your midsection you have to actually do something number seven the blood type diets is there anything to it I bought the book initially it sounded like there is some special technology that potentially could work when you pull a string at the back of the book and search where this research goes it doesn can at all and that different blood types but these different blood types relate to more of an immune difference than a digestive food difference if you are type O the theory is your body thrives on animal proteins and low carbs type A States you should enjoy a vegetarian diet with limited red meat and the reason why it does work for certain people is because all of the recommendations for foods are Whole Foods you Foods regardless of what type of specific diet that you the blood type if you just go from refined foods to Whole Foods you going to feel better you better number eight EMF blockers the stuff that comes out of this cell phone right here and so when you have an EMF blocker you sticker on the back of your phone and that waves I just want to tell you right now you can save your money don that because I talked to someone that really knows about this a physicist and he was just laughing about it because a little sticker on your cell phone is not going to block all the EMF radiation or nullify or kind of suck it into the area that put a layer of metal or tin foil along there and block it but then you going to get transmission number nine carb blockers have you ever seen those threein one car blocker that way you can continue to eat your pasta and your bread and lose weight if you look at the ingredient it has a certain extract from white beans that does inhibit to a certain degree starches not sugar only to a very tiny degree maybe if you lucky it would take a very small percentage maybe 2% of that the starch in the donut and it may slow down the enzymes to break it down thinking that oh it through me right now what happen to that 2% of that starch it going to go down into the small intestine if your enzymes don down your microbes will then you going to get bloating then you might say well why don enzyme yeah you could do that maybe you could consume nine bottles of the car blocker to digest the starch in the doughnut not the sugar not the seed oils but the starch maybe that might work you might want to do an experiment be a very expensive experiment and how much pleasure are you going to get from eating that one doughnut if you blocking just the starch of that doughnut probably not going to be worth it now we get to the big one psychiatric medication it treats the symptom of a theory depression is a chemical imbalance of a deficiency of Serotonin but that whole time psychiatrists were prescribing all these medications for this theory that wasn the very limited effectiveness of psychiatric drugs actually Compares with Placebo outcomes many of the studies that indicate any Effectiveness from Psych drugs is owed to the placebo effect then people might say well okay so so what if it people think it for them great right if it didn account for these serious side effects emotionally where you even become more depressed or have all sorts of problems with even feeling emotion in general that you just feel like a zombie I mean are we supposed to get on this medication and be on it forever or take it for a period of time until it corrects something no you keep taking it it highly addictive within two weeks and now you whole time the psychiatrist does not evaluate your Foods just giving you a pill for a symptom and it because all the things that the psychiatrist is against is any alternative to medicine but the worst psychiatric treatment even worse I think than drugs is the ECT electr convulsive therapy if you want to call it a therapy some doctors even claim that it and effective they don it might give some temporary Improvement in depression and they also downplay the long-term effects and also how many of these problems and side effects come back and unfortunately ECT is even administered to certain people that did not give their consent sometimes they even give it to people in hospice like why would you want to give someone in hospice ECT for my viewpoint that probably the most dubious treatment that you could possibly do especially if we something like ear candles yet in the news or even online you don a lot of the dangers being promoted with ECT because there involved anyway I appreciate you watching I will see you in the next video	Success
Why Are We Doing This to Our Kids?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IfaR9ivpyE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we actually ask him some questions about what people ate in 1948 hey hi is Dad there yep he here he hi so now everyone knows my uh my name you called me other than Dr Berg they all call me Snooks so great thanks for that how about oh no no anything but that some people are gonna probably say well why are you asking your 87-year-old dad about what they ate back in 1948 when people don remember every single name of every single kid in your class in fifth grade question I have is uh did you see a lot of overweight people back in 1948 in your class were there a lot of obese kids in 48 no no not really at all was diabetes common children uh I only know one I had one friend that had diabetes uh um but other than that no what about like uh food allergies uh or Autism was that popular back then no no it wasn grocery store and you looked for cereals did they have things like Froot Loops and Captain Crunch and Flintstone pebbles no no no uh they you Ruth I remember that you know the the original uh Baby Ruth and uh maybe Snickers MH but but that that was not a lot of bagged you know stuff like they have now was high fructose corn syrup popular in a lot of the candies and sodas not that I know didn had oatmeal with milk that your cereal yes what about your teacher did the teacher remind all the kids to hurry up and take their midm morning snacks because it snack no no absolutely not what about your mom did your mom ever tell you that don something before dinner that yes yeah yeah snacking was not a big thing back then was it no my snacks I would have maybe it would be a a piece of fruit an apple or something on that order wow what about the concern of saturated fats being bad back then was was that like a real big thing where you have to avoid saturated fats no not that I know that I had never heard of that at that age really didn parents cook with lard and beef fat taow yes uh lard was the the main one I would think what about uh red meat was was that a a danger thing like people would say Don gonna cause cancer no no how about um was there such a thing as uh at the grocery store did they have sweetened and flavored yogurts uh not that I know of they had they I think they had yogurt and my grandparents would make theirs didn have a garden back then yes and they did canning right that was a big thing for Wow preparing for the the foreseeable future everyone had a cell phone back then too right no no I don well thanks for the interview dad I appreciate it and uh I later okay good to talk to you back in 1948 you had literally less than 1% obesity with children now it charts it food allergies asthma autism non-existent now very common is it all the C-sections infant formulas or was it the introduction of fluoride in our water in 1945 when you go into the grocery store the largest area of junk food or alra processed food is under a category called snack foods problem with snacking in general is every time you eat anything you create a spike in insulin regardless of what the food is and of course if you carbohydrates you Spike of insulin currently not only are we snacking but we worst snacks you could possibly consume we insulin through the entire day that insulin level doesn to come down to normal that Port pancreas has to constantly put out so much insulin to take all that Sugar from the blood and get it out of the blood insulin resistance is literally behind nearly every chronic illness from uh fatty liver high blood pressure diabetes obesity inflammatory diseases not to mention all the mood disorders and the dementia and The Chronic cognitive decline if you compare the grocery stores in America then you go to Europe like France or Italy a lot of people go to the food market on a regular basis they have raw cheese they have meats they have vegetables they have fruits and yes they do sell bread but it the refined bread that you would get in the American Grocery Store the quality food in Europe is just way better than America icial bread right you have dough conditioner preservatives to increase shelf life even high fructose corn syrup they put that in the bread homemade bread flour water yeast salt in America we have restaurants in fact you don even have to drive to the restaurant they kids that go to the fast food restaurants they superp siize it drinking these huge liquid candy made from corn corn sugar and high frose corn syrup these are all new ingredients and we back in 1948 we did not have Ultra processed food calories now a teenager consumes over 65% of all of their calories being ultr processed food calories an adult calories are over 50% and a toddler calories for Ultra processed food is 45% yes Sugar a bigger problem in the area of ultra process food calories that I want to share with you the number one alter processed food ingredient that makes the most money of all of them seed oils let right seed oils over $240 billion a year talking about corn oil soy oil cotton seed canola 25% up to 30% of all our calories are seed oils somehow seed oils have been made to be heart healthy this next ingredient is number two on the list and it generates 220 billion dollars a year grain based starches the highly processed industrial starch modified food starch modified corn starch it the molto dextrin it spikes your blood sugar sometimes a lot higher than actual sugar yet it you what about the starches when you buy gluten-free products what do they replace it with rice starch tapioca starch maltodextrin like I said before it have heart healthy seed oils but you have something else that interesting about whole grains right they get this little seal of approval from the American Heart Association certified says it can help you lower your cholesterol and help your heart on top of everything our children are told 60% of their calories should be grains in the meantime our children are not getting healthier they if you please comment down below and tell me your experience of what you did back in 1948 or 1950 or or even before that	Success
How to Remove Skin Tags and Warts Overnight	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlT081VhRLM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let or a wart overnight you gradual Improvement every time you apply this real simple technique and it really only two simple ingredients the most important thing to teach you today is not only how to get rid of it but how to prevent it from coming back because a wart or skin tag is the tip of the iceberg first question is what is the difference between a skin tag and a wart with a wart you called HPV this is why you don scratch it or try to cut it off because then it can form into a cluster the skin tag usually occurs in areas where there in your body we remedy for a skin tag and a wart and I going to explain why that work when we have to look at the triggers you have stress that weakens the immune system but with the skin tag we don have the immune system involved let first talk about insulin insulin is going to make things grow when someone insulin is too high they for these skin tags this is why there such a higher risk for skin tags with diabetics people that are overweight and women who have PCOS how do we lower insulin the problem with insulin with most people is that the body is producing a lot more insulin because they have what resistance insulin resistance is a situation where the person had high levels of insulin over a period of time and the body is blocking that to a certain degree as a way to comp compensate the pancreas is going to make a lot more insulin two big reasons why people have too much insulin is they eating too many carbs or they too frequently what insulin resistance is that the body has a more difficult time absorbing glucose if there of the purposes of insulin is to help you pull in and receive glucose when someone has insulin resistance they have a much more difficult time absorbing sugar or glucose into the cells because that to be able to help you absorb glucose the brain cells don over time things get worse memory problems concentration problems early dementia a very simple solution to this is just to give your body an alternative fuel source stop giving the body fuel that it can right now give the body ketones fatty acids and protein this way we can kill three birds with one stone fix the insulin resistance what creating it is consuming too many carbs the body will finally get fuel that it needs to work correctly especially your brain and the need for insulin goes down so now there be high to grow things like a skin tag or a wart so how do we do that very simply lower your carbohydrates and eat less frequently that intermittent fasting those two things would not just help you lose weight it going to help something like PC it normalize insulin this way we to the actual root cause of this entire problem in the first place before we get into the remedy to get rid of the skin tag and wart I need to explain one last little point if you have a wart you have a virus and there interesting about this virus what it does to your immune system this virus will come out of remission and create warts if the immune system is compromised we talked about stress we talked about insulin we didn about vitamin D yes there are hundreds of different types of human papiloma viruses human papiloma virus 16 and 18 very specifically cause your vitamin D receptors to shut down maybe not 100% but they downgrade the vitamin D receptor the fact that you have the virus or the wart already means that you that creating an environment where it can Thrive these viruses are very intelligent obviously they know that vitamin D is the most important vitamin to control the immune system so if they can inhibit that to a certain degree and create a deficiency in you the virus can Thrive the immune system is compromised it one of the purposes of the immune system is to kill viruses it because a lot more people get warts during the winter months than in the summer months I wonder why that is vitamin D because there vitamin D is a very potent antiviral compound when someone has sufficient vitamin D they can put these viruses in remission for a very long time the vitamin D will actually help reduce the risk of certain types of cancer especially those related to human papiloma viruses just to make it really simple I would highly recommend not taking any less than 10,000 IUS of vitamin D3 every single day especially through the winter unless you live near the equator where you lot of sun if you live in the north but 10 to maybe 20,000 I use per day would be enough to put you in a good place we talked about the root causes now let talk about how to get rid of skin tags and warts very quickly you use two remedies one is a certain type of iodine I recommend that you get a very specific type from the drugstore because it deeper question is what is this I doing to the skin tag well it protein iodine is also very antiviral antimicrobial so that for warts too iodine is a very powerful dehydrator as well it dehydrate the wart or the skin tag and if you have excess estrogen iodine is one of the most potent Regulators of estrogen this is why it things like fibrocystic breasts or ovarian cyst both conditions occur when you have too much estrogen and you also going to use garlic you can simply just take a clove and crush it and you just need one little drop WS in garlic that called Allison this compound is super powerful against viruses and because a skin tag is similar to a Ward and a lot of times they really know exactly which one is which we there because the garlic isn necessarily going to shrink the skin tag it all you need to do is crush garlic take one drop of garlic in a little dish with one drop of this eyy then you to take a little Q-Tip mix it together really nicely apply it to the wart or skin tag tissue and put a Band-Aid over it and forget about it and you going to repeat this every day until there shocked to see even after 24 hours how much is left both these remedies together are are the most powerful thing that I know of to shrink a skin tag or wart but if you change then I would recommend something called salicylic acid which is the main chemical in Aspirin you crush it add a little water take your Q-tip apply it to the wart put a Band-Aid on it and just do that every single day other people use tea tree oil and use outside of vinegar or they might use Castro oil maybe regano oil I highly recommend using the garlic oil and the iodine as the first attempt because that usually creates the biggest impact and biggest change now since we did mention something like low carb diet if you want to know more about that you can watch this video right here check it out	Success
YouÂve Been Lied To...	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFVp4QY0FBk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	the absolute worst diet and nutrition advice that doctors still give people of course I just certain doctors that are more old school that just focus on medicine the last advice that I is the most dangerous one number one people can get all their nutrition from food they don several problems with this Theory number one the rdas for most of these nutrients are over a hundred years old completely outdated it Vitamin D from your food potassium someone needs magnesium someone needs top of that people are eating the wrong foods that deplete them of nutrients especially refined carbohydrates and sugar over 50% of their calories are refined foods that depletes a lot of nutrition then we have the missing nutrients in food because our soils are so bad when you go to the grocery store and you buy just salad you think that salad is grown on soil it grown either on dirt where they just give like three mineral a lot of the salad is hydroponic you don microorganisms in the soil unfortunately the microbes are really the key giving the food nutrition then we have the medications that deplete you of nutrients too like statin drugs the drug that blocks cholesterol if you that drug you something called co-enzyme Q10 you take Metformin you deficient in vitamin B12 and B1 a lot of indication that you take will deplete things like magnesium trace minerals I don their food to see if they least the rdas let need 4700 mg then you have the argument there supplements will help you just because something has not been researched doesn interesting because there articles in the news vitamin A vitamin E causes more harm to you so we should avoid these vitamins the next time someone tells you oh yeah nutrition doesn cause more harm than good just ask them this maybe we should just refine the food take out the nutrients and eat what now we basically calories without nutrition next recommendation take more calcium to prevent osteoporosis because our bones are made out of calcium and we just need to make sure we take more of it did you realize that you can test someone they can be completely normal with the levels of calcium but have S severe bone loss you could have severe loss of calcium in the blood and show normal bone health most of the time uh people get osteoporosis as they age usually after menopause when our hormones start going downhill especially estrogen and also testosterone estrogen helps maintain calcium in the bone when women get their ovaries removed osteoporosis risk goes up there involved with osteoporosis I want to mention and that is parathyroid glands if you look at the parathyroid hormone you can kind of look at it like an extra vitamin D it helps increase the absorption of calcium in the blood the body you know says oh listen we need to maintain this calcium because it important for signaling communication between cells one of the purposes for bone is to act as a calcium Reserve like a storage or calcium what is that paraa going to do if we it it maintain normal calcium when someone vitamin D is low parathyroid goes up it grabs calcium from the bone to maintain that calcium along with that you have another very important vitamin called vitamin K2 which actually helps take that calcium from the blood and put it into the bone without vitamin K2 the calcium doesn and also to build bone you need magnesium of course you can have osteoprosis if you drink too much alcohol or you don you take an acids this next one really gets to me sunblock because the Sun causes skin cancer here with this sun blocker this allall started in the 80s where we had a lot of health problems go up I wonder if it connected to vitamin D because of this introduction of what we did not get a reduction in melanoma it continue to go up I agree that we shouldn burned but we need to go out there to at least get enough vitamin D think about What vitamin D does with your immune system it feeds certain cells that kill cancer cells we cannot get enough vitamin D from our food but if you operating off this completely false idea that all we need is 600 international units of vitamin D3 as the rdas which is completely bogus an average person only gets like 500 IUS of vitamin D3 from the Sun so it maintenance dosage 10,000 use every single day just to function normally the next bad advice snack frequently to prevent overe eting this is not true what you is you creating a blood sugar situation you actually keeping the hunger strong when you snack eating simulates hunger when you don chance to convert into burning your fat you can because the darn insulin thing insulin is the hormone that will block your ability to tap into your fat Reserve snacking is bad advice intermittent fasting is good advice this next one is bad you can have sugar as long as it in moderation it toxic food alcohol smoking do you realize who came up with that advice food manufacturing companies they came out with that because they had to get people to eat it somehow what best thing we just in moderation you lot of people that agree with that listen let me tell you the big problem with that advice when you eat your carbohydrates in moderation you will not be able to tap into your fat reserves some people might if they have a super good metabolism but most people can because they have insulin resistance that burn their own fat which means they won appetite try to do a program or a diet when you people can stick with it if you just help them get rid of that appetite and that hunger and to do that you cannot consum carbs in moderation the next one you need to be very careful of your saturated fats you want to eat lean protein saturated fat does not clog your arteries the carbs are a much bigger risk for heart problems than saturated fat we need cholesterol for our brain for our membranes around our cells for our hormones think about when someone gets on a stat and Drug the risk for cancer goes up if you just shut down cholesterol through the entire body you have a ser misunderstanding with the function and the purpose of cholesterol in the body the body actually makes most of the cholesterol we have only a small percentage comes from the diet next one start consuming more whole grains because they heart healthy whole grains trigger blood sugar many products don just have whole grains in them they have refined grains mixed in with them and maltodextrin modified food starch I mean there might be a few products out there but they other things the other problem with whole grains is that we have have this thing called Fates a chemical compound that blocks certain key nutrients and we have the gluten in the whole grain gluten really irritates the gut another advice that I I really disagree with is so you better avoid red meat because red meat causes cancer World Health Organization and other organizations recommend that you avoid red meat grass-fed grass finished red meat has higher amounts of Omega-3 I really believe that grass-fed grassfish red meat is the healthiest thing you can eat it does not cause cancer another point is that it because our brain runs on glucose yes it does run on glucose but it also can run in ketones and if you keep feeding your brain glucose you situation in your brain where your cells can insulin resistance your neurons will start to starve and you symptoms of dementia just do the simple experiment cut down carbs have a high quality prote and just see how your brain feels within an hour it feel much better then go back to the carbohydrates see how your brain feels you go right into the brain fog another one is if someone has high blood pressure they think a much better solution would be to eliminate the junk food that has the refined carbohydrates which is directly behind the hypertension and also to increase vitamin D and especially potassium start increasing potassium to balance out that sodium you can have minimize the blood pressure you can put the person in a good situation cut out the carbs and get to the root cause the last piece of bad advice all calories are equal it doesn calories are from sugar or from celery they all are the same this is outdated old information you end up blaming the patient for low willpower because they can because they they body does not treat all Cal equal instead of creating a calorie deficit only create a carbohydrate calorie deficit what reduce those calories for carbohydrates is you then have an alternative fuel it to burn more fat your hunger and Cravings will diminish and you be able to stick to it a lot longer practicing a minute fasting and get the benefits of that since we the bad device let advice of exactly what you should be eating with this video right here check it out	Success
The Microbe That Changes EVERYTHING	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCjQAQuWiYc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we have an extremely important topic that revolves around the most important microbe in our body and today I brought on one of the top experts Dr William Davis so welcome doc thanks for being on here thank you Dr ber thanks for the invitation yeah so you wrote a whole book uh primarily revolves around this one microbe and I want to just Dive Right In your book is called super gut which is a fascinating read this microb is called el rudai out of all the thousands of microbes in our like what makes this stand out as more important than the other ones it 60 years it last Tuesday but it was not recognized just how powerful this micro was in fact the first 40 Years of research around this microbe centered mostly around what it did for babies that it was shown to reduce for instance regurgitation of breast milk or formula reduced KCT you know that kind of fussy restlessness and crying that that babies get and that maybe it abbreviated the diarrhea after an antibiotic but it really didn much farther than that until this group in Boston MIT stumbled upon some unusual effects because there had been some very preliminary cell culture type evidence so very preliminary stuff that showed that ride might have anti-cancer effects particularly in colon cancer so this group very smart very excellent research was exploring that question and they started to see all these unexpected effects that they they going on here they saw that the animals stayed young they didn lose their hair and stop M they played with each other they groomed each other they stayed slender with thick Rich fur they saw that if they inflicted wounds this is animals this sounds awful but when they inflicted wounds healing time was cut in half they showed that there was a dramatic rise in testosterone and elderly mice a marked increase in growth hormone an amplification of the immune response so much so as you recall as you and I age the thymus gland right here beneath the sternum shrinks starting at age 15 and by age 70 it about 10% of its original volume and capacity to produce tea cells that protect us from viruses and bacteria and that flu or pumac pneumonia but 18-year- olds typically don differentiates between it thyroid it little lower it exactly it of te- cell immunity of the immune response well that restored back to its original size in in mice in mice wow no one human study yet so all these extraordinary observations in in mice and so I decided to get this microb and play with it but it commercially available as tablets for infants so the dosage for infants is very small so I just simply reasoned how do I increase it well you take a hundred tablets of that product but it sugary product so it so I just simply Amplified counts by making it as a yogurt it course it looks and smells like yogurt kind of but it bacterial counts in this case a thousandfold that everything this usually doesn as you know if you see something in mice it often doesn experience but in this case uh everything seen in mice everything every last observation seen in mice I seeing in humans wow and as far as um what percentage is this microb in the western world I mean it in a great majority of the population yes so Dr Gard reuter he microbiologist first first isolated it in 1962 from the breast milk of a German breastfeeding mother he said back then it ubiquitous it stool it academic career he made a number of comments that he difficult to find such that by the 2000s he could barely find it at all that been corroborated several times by others we have a clinical study on proposing where we do several hundred people and see how many will corroborate that and also correlate s to other biomarkers because so crucial for overall health and youthfulness but it it rorai as well as other lactobacillus species there are uniquely susceptible to Common antibiotics all it takes is a round of penicillin or ampicilin or a MOX aylin that you may have taken years and years ago and you thereby lost all its huge advantages wow I think you mentioned I was in your book but it 96% of population doesn very many left or exactly right the best estimates we have from recent uh evidence is about 4% of people one in 25 people still have it and so that means uh 24 out of 25 don losses as you recall one of the great effects of this microb you know most microbes in the gastrointes microbiome colonize the colon way way down 24t down from the mouth and that supposed to be but rorai is unique in that it has the unique capacity to colonize the small intestine and that residents and produce natural antibiotics and these natural antibiotics are effective in killing fecal microbes which as you know is a huge problem now this notion of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth what we say sibo sip po that is feal microbes like ecoli Etc have colonized the small intestine where they don they that well is the loss of Rai and maybe some related species that have this unique ability to colonize the small intestin produce antibiotics of their own and these are different than the antibiotics you get from the hospital from the doctor um these are these are very selective antibiotics unlike the stuff you get in a in in the hospital where it wipes that it GI track and so is the loss of Rai part of the reason why this has become an epidemic that is because explains why sibo has become an epidemic I I believe it is yeah because now we have no protection against these other microbes so it called a keystone microb right which is kind of a it does more than just one thing it kind of helps the whole ecosystem in that area right it kind of helps balance everything yeah isn wonderful it I took an antibiotic like zyxin it just kills a bunch of stuff but it doesn start the process of restoration so exactly right you restore ruite maybe some other microbes and it begins the process microbes are kind of like people we don partners and families and friends and neighbors and co-workers and communities microbes are the same way so restoration of ruite is that first step not just in restoring ruite but in cultivating a healthy community of microbes and then now let the huge effects that I about it causes the body to increase that hormone oxytocin which is kind of a hormone that people know about you know you baby but it does a little more than that right oxytocin does a lot more now of course as we age oxytocin goes down but tell us a little bit about this oxytocin what that does so it from the hypothalamus that is released by when you restore Rai if we believe the animal evidence is about three threefold 300% or more we corroborate that humans were having a hard time with the acid so that in progress oxytocin traditionally regarded as the hormone of love and empathy it is that you get this surgeon oxytocin you people who either get rotaride by some means like a probiotic preparation or as the yogurt to higher counts and people will say you know I I I like my spouse better I get with my family better their foibles and quirks don much I like my co-workers better my my favorite I accept the opinions of other people more readily I love that um but I also call oxytocin the hormone of shape and body composition it determines where your muscle is and how much you have and also determines where fat is located so it has a huge effect on your shap shape you know shape is a big thing people say weight loss but I let because you know the G Agonist world is highlighted what a flawed area that is you lose fat and by the way with the GP Agonist you lose subcutaneous talk about OIC right like OIC all those things those are selective for fat beneath the skin not the fat in your abdomen and that problematic form of fat as you know is the abdominal fat of course geop one Agonist lead to loss of muscle huge losses of muscle and we know we know with excellent long-term evidence when you lose muscle you die younger several years typically as well as your last years tend to be characterized by Frailty Falls fractures dementia Etc so the loss of muscle is critical yet the FDA approved a class of drugs that permits huge loss of muscle so preserving muscle during any effort to lose weight is absolutely critical so you don and including early mortality and oxytocin determines how much muscle you have you know personally so I late 60s when I was in my early 60s when I started doing these things specifically rotari I gain 13 pounds of muscle and my strength increased by 50% over three weeks I Burke I hate the gym I can here so I go once a week for 15 minutes get the heck out of there yet I despite that meager effort I gain 13 pounds and 50% in I was doing lat pull Downs for instance 10 repetitions at 130 pounds over three weeks 15 minutes a week I was doing 200 pounds wow so and that borne out also by the animal experimental data and what I see in real life is this rest now here thing though those of us who had more muscle in our youth tend to regain more muscle so if you were a longdistance runner had skinny you won say as somebody who was a wrestler or a weightlift or a shot put through you know that kind of a thing and when you first told me that I was like is that actually true so I have not changeed my workout uh when I started this probably was have been about six weeks maybe two months ago I went from 185 to 1902 or 193 and uh not fat I definitely gaining muscle which I am like wow it like I anything so this is a game changer in fact I even told my my parents my father lost a lot of muscle mass so he it first of all his hair is coming back he like a game changer especially with age related muscle loss but also it keeps you independent you able to bound upstairs get in and out of your car with ease go for long walks ride your bike and not succumb to being to loss of Independence and end up in an assisted living center so preserving muscle is a huge advant and and in guys of course there testosterone just from that and ladies experience a preservation or increase in bone density so it for combating all the effects of Aging yeah huge I want to go back to this empathy word for because this I want really I want people to understand what that word means because I looked it up and um got a little more data looked at the derivation of it and uh it really boils down to being able to the ability to see someone wow if someone could do that they going to get in an argument with their spouse because that of an argument like the person unwilling to see someone right even in social interactions if you can Viewpoint you and forth this is huge so what I just want to tell you what happened to me um I didn would say a week after taking this and we probiotic not a not a yogurt because it going to we in a second but um I didn except my wife says what is gotten into you I said what do you mean she goes you want to hug me like five times a day and you want to snuggle and I it over me she goes keep eating that yogurt right so I mean that interesting and I just just had another response with one of my staff members and she said I said because she the yogurt I said you feel any change she goes she goes I don people are nicer to me I said are you sure it maybe it people she goes yeah it could be because like everywhere she goes like she like very interested in the other person I mean that such an important thing I mean could you imagine if more people had that ability what I think that having this full microbiome creates a natural amount of oxytocin this is not something new it something we had at one time and I think we had lost right so it that we just something that from these antibiotics and other things you know I think about that a lot Dr Berg because uh I remind myself that we live in a time of record social isolation yes pandemic but even pre pandemic record suicide likewise pre pandemic there was a 35% increase in suicide of course half of all marriages end in divorce and the psychology Community has been tabulating measuring and tabulating measures of narcissistic behavior since 1963 and the increase has been dramatic so you know there of things at work here social media other things we you and I don much control your listeners don control over that perhaps but we do have have control over this microbe and thereby the capacity to boost oxytocin and I describing people like other people better they get along better you know Dr Paul Zach is a he calls himself a neuroeconomist in count in LA and he did something crazy he went to the jungles of New Guinea and found a tribe who had never seen Western people before so painted two generations away from cannibalism wow and he says the first thing when cter when you enter their Camp is the stink of unwashed humans because there they were friendly and embracing and they welcomed them what he wanted to do was check the oxytocin blood levels before and after this ritual dance they do well he did and he showed no rise so he never published the data but he mentioned in a book about oxytosis so I called him I said Paul I see you didn publish that would you share it with me he very generously did and I compared those levels this is a group of people unexposed to antibiotics glyphosate herbus all that stuff and I have data of my own compared it it but you kind of get a crude sense and it was clear that primitive people have much higher levels of oxytocin because they still have rotor and they study for the presence of Rite they all have it as do wild animals but we lost it wow and so we see lower levels in humans modern humans and I think it we get it from our mother with breast milk um and how many kids don could be a big problem too right there that Mom got antibiotics at time of delivery she probably got it many times over her lifetime probably couldn it to the child and the child gets antibiotics at delivery and gets antibiotics uh thousands of antibiotic prescriptions for every thousand children every year and so we out Rite and other microbes because bags are kind of stupid they it drop a nuclear bomb on a population it doesn picks out the children The Women College professors the the Social Work It Kills everybody yeah and I think the uh the the myth is that people think oh if you take anotic it all comes back for a couple weeks yeah you back to where you were a couple weeks later right that is I don true absolutely not it the tough question is how much can we restore that that restoring these what what you is Keystone microbes is so important as compared to say an antibiotic you know if antibiotics got us here how can another round of antibiotics be part of the solution and of course the use of fermented foods like kimchi sauerkraut veggies you ferment on your kitchen counter like cucumbers another spectacular way though the crazy thing about that is those microbes INF fermented foods are not the ones that colonize the GI tract they somehow cross feed they provide nutrients to beneficial microbes and they bloom so you get to bloom in all the beneficial species particularly ones that produce the fatty ass bate that yield such effects as healing of the intestinal lining reduction in blood sugar blood pressure depression anxiety deeper sleep a restoration of youthful childlike dreams oh yeah flying showing up at the school playing your underwear and not knowing your lines how did you know I had that dream all that stuff comes back wow yeah talk about vivid dreams that that stands out and definitely my sleep is much better um you know you have a lot of people that have either um rosacea or um a lot of skin issues and I know that some technical parts of that like there bacteria dying which I don too technical but just in a simple way how do you explain what between your gut and your skin lot of that wisdom is unfolding I I break down skin rashes into two categories the simple skin rashes that is due to A disruption of the skin microbiome acne would be a good example of that but then the more complex conditions like rosacea and psoriasis tend to start in the gut so in other words if I give somebody a drug that blocks some pathway like like an inflammatory marker all you do is block the inflammatory Mark and get partial response but that person still has sibo and SEO and is thereby subject to long-term consequences like colon cancer uler of colitis diverticular disease weight gain obesity so the pharmaceutical model is so deeply flawed but it ingrained into common practice this is what they do in common practice they give you a Blocker of some pathway that all said it the path is to restore a healthy microbiome saying somebody with rosacea but I these basic things what I love about the microbiome things we we pharmaceutical model which is if you have pacak pneumonia kill it if you have aaak abscess kill it right well there nothing specific for those pathogens so let amount of wisdom built into it as you know so if we restore those Keystone microbes that help us they care take care of it for you you just have to provide the basic building blocks for them to do that do you believe from your experience like these people that have these food allergies and sensitivities they can improve that by restoring the microbes in the gut yeah isn wonderful I see it over and over and over again people say I can Maps or legumes or nightshades or histamin containing foods or fructose I only can eat seven foods right or they had IGG testing food intolerance testing I can only eat I can foods and I see all this go away and the the science is evolving this is sibo It intestine small intestines very permeable by Design very thin mucus barrier single leg very thin intestinal lining and it that all our nutrients and when but when fecal microbes invade that small intestine 24 feet trillions of microbes that live and die rapidly it inflames the intestinal wall and it makes it even more permeable and lets all kinds of stuff through including bacterial breakdown products this process of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and consumption of wheat the glid and protein wheat is a lethal combination that essentially guarantees you going to get fat diabetic experience dementia and have all kinds of other conditions the neglect of this issue in conventional care the haphazard administration of antibiotics and the awful awful advice to cut your cholesterol saturated fat eat more healthy whole grains and everything in moderation is is a recipe for absolute disaster that playing out around it that I have so much to do every day it a look at a a typical conventional GI doctor right you go to the doctor and you have bloating wow they their evaluation and you up with a some medication that is just going to manage it to somewhat but then it gets worse I mean like could you imagine if they just had some awareness of what actually restore uh more of the root cause I mean it just it but I think it aware out there it know how much we can change the medical profession but we can actually educate the person on the street so they can make their own choices what you did is you had this wild idea I going to turn this into a yogurt you took it and you mixed it with a fiber kind of just describe what you did to grow this as I mentioned I got the original microb and El m r but it was present at such low count it was 100 million of two strains which sounds like a if it was money but in microbes it it how could I increase it without having to take 100 tablets which would be absurd so I simply fermented it of course microbes don no male and female microbes they just double themselves well lactobacilus Rite doubles every three hours or so at human body temperature so I simply fermented it for 36 hours uh 12 doublings I also added Prebiotic fiber it adding calure to your garden you know this on your farm if you add calure or other fertilizer you get bigger tomatoes and cucumbers so I did the same kind of thing and we did quantify we Quantified number of microbes in 12 hours 24 hours 36 hours 48 hours and by sheer dumb luck I happen to pick the magic number the best number which is 36 hours when you go longer than 36 hours you start to get more death of microbes dead microbes are still beneficial but not as beneficial as live microbes um and so you get this big ramp up in counts we get somewhere around 300 billion so we start with Millions hundreds of millions now we get hundreds of billions so we get a thousandfold increase over the original number we did this using something called flow cytometry and we count the microbes and so that was the key to I believe now if we had done it as a probiotic you know one of the difficulties with probiotics I formulate probiotics is they you want to put a whole bunch into a capsule say so in other words if you want to put 300 billion lactus roer into a capsule it cost consumers like three or $400 a month it one wants to do that so you can buy the capsules at lower counts at at affordable cost you amplify the counts through fermentation like the like the yogurt by the way doesn can be coconut milk can be salsa can be um hummus wow yeah Pik Theo wow and uh uh but Dairy is so forgiving so available and so familiar to so many people it that we get 300 billion counts per half cup or 120 million liters serving and I think that effects in pushing back SEO because we counts sufficient to overcome the trillions yeah of feal microbes of sibo yeah you also shared with me another idea which I think is brilliant there this probiotic right at Walmart the drugstore and then you could take a capsule of it there very well researched microbe in there that you could I guess you mix it with fruit juice for 72 hours you put it outside right and then you maybe put some top on it you don it up because it you because the micro will eat a lot of the sugar and uh that idea I mean like what a great drink it kind of like kombucha but it actually has microbes in it you know many of us miss juice it was nice to have mango juice and cherry juice and all the pomegranate juice but they awful for you well here the microbe consume the sugar and you can consume it down to zero so the final product is no longer sweet wow but it effervescent so this microbe is a so we make wine and beer for for instance with sacris sisia that well it sorry this yeah okay this is a similar cousin and it is a spectacular fermentor if you put it into juice so what I do is a capsule into juice any volume of juice but you have to be careful the juice can sodium Ben or other preservative and then as you say cap it lightly because you like a cauldron because it carbon dioxide and if you cap it too tightly you your kitchen uh so we keep it light may you can vent it you can even go to these beer brewing stores and they have venting caps for like $3 you can do that too but you leave it on your kitchen counter for at least 48 Hours test it we have this wonderful sugar sensing device in our mouth called a tongue we can taste it and if it another 12 24 hours uh you want it not sweet you and I don listeners don drink this it important things people can do if you need a course of antibiotic let one of your listeners says well they going to put an implant in my mouth they antibiotics or had I had a terrible skin infection whatever and you have to have an antibiotic well you can drink this juice like a quarter half cup couple three times a day and it important thing you can do at least partially protect the Integrity of your gast inest microbiome nothing is fully protective against antibiotics but it the best we have if you haven that book super gut get that book right now you also on your website you have a really great ongoing program that people can participate and you coach them and things like that I link down below so people could know about that but I just wanted to have you on just to really talk about this one microbe that I appreciate you coming on and then what I want to do is roll right into kind of a video of how a person could make this microbe and uh I will so don yet you can just watch that and you can make notes and I stuff in the description but thank you so much for coming on Doc I really appreciate it oh my pleasure Dr Burke always so this is very simple how we make this we probiotic one capsule and then we will open it up and then we this is a tablespoon take organic half and half just to make a paste mix it up really good don and half in there right off the bat just about two tablespoons and then we can pour the rest of this half and half in there one quart I really good I container two containers We of this in here even it out pretty good okay we yogurt maker we have two of them right very carefully okay now we have to add water to it so we got water right here so I going to pour the water like so and I want that level to be at the same level as the mixture inside the containers so I looking to see if it and yes it is so we now have the water at the level of a little bit more than I wanted so that next part and of course if you have a different machine you to just do the same type of thing on the left we have temperature and time so we can press this once okay and then we want this at 99° Fen so we down okay and then press start on that and then now what we eight hours we hours okay and then we press start again and guess what we put the top on it and then we to wait for 36 hours and then after that going to then put it in the refrigerator for storage okay we the refrigerator after 36 hours and leaving in the refrigerator for a couple hours to cool down and now we to consume a half of a cup of this every single day I like to have mine before bed it delicious you can add uh berries to it if you need to add a sweetener uh go ahead but I think you delicious a half a cup a day	Success

BETTER Than Ozempic! STOP Your Cravings	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neabI31ofMc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today I things that can help suppress your appetite and this is backed up by science you ever wonder how some people can just go through the entire day and be in front of food and totally resist it yet other people think about certain things they shouldn sometimes they might think that this is a lack of willpower or they professional procrastinator that is absolutely not true what they knowledge I today at the end of this presentation you of what to eat or what to do to suppress your appetite which directly increases your control over food so you can lose weight look good feel good about yourself and have a good willpower hunger in appetite don stomach sometimes it starts with your microbes your gut bacteria that manipulate your brain there and bizarre information how gut microbes can actually cause you to eat the wrong thing today I these Temptations sugar refined carb foods with MSG monosodium glutamate alcohol Ultra processed foods AKA junk Foods let starting with coffee coffee stimulates something that actually helps you feel like you the exact same thing just make sure you do an organic decaf coffee if you going to do that avocado was a really good thing to satisfy you not just because it natural chemicals in avocado help satisfy you reduce hunger I know with me uh when I consume guacamole it really fills me up really fast plus it has certain fiber that can feed your bacteria and fiber in anything slows down the spike of blood sugar it will prevent you from having a low blood sugar situation which will increase appetite dark chocolate there certain chemical that suppresses appetite realize when they go up with the percentage it going to be less and less sugar so if you can find something like 95% or even 90% you to go because the amount of sugar in there is very very tiny and there lot of magnesium in chocolate as well cayenne pepper is another thing you should be adding to your food in certain studies just the smell of it alone will decrease hunger which is pretty wild apple cider vinegar is the next one on the list if you add that tablespoon in a glass of water it stabilize your blood sugar even if you actually raise your blood sugar Alid of vinegar will help stabilize them so your blood sugar will not come down too low one of the reasons why this works is your body can actually use the acid in appid of vinegar as fuel there certain chemical in green tea e g c g super effective of suppressing appetite bone broth is the next thing on the list drinking bone broth actually creates a very similar effect to being satisfied after eating something more Savory like meat has a lot of nutrients you should try that sometime and you one is just a protein Rich meal like eggs or even red meat because out of all the things you can eat like carbs fats especially if you have a high quality protein like eggs red meat because not only are there high quality amino acids but you have a lot of other nutrition in the meat that can satisfy your brain and give your body what it really needs when it adding Ginger to your Foods it has the ability to stimulate digestive juices which allow you to extract more nutrients from the food that you eat next one is dark leafy green vegetables or lettuce and then the olive oil is a fat that also help extract some of the fat soluble nutrients from those greens which are certain nutrients that go beyond just vitamins and minerals next one on the list is MCT oil you can get these from coconuts but MCT oil is a certain type of fat that does not involve all the different chemical reactions like other types of fats easily to digest and it a lot of it turns into ketones which will give you more energy than carbs or even protein because the body likes to consume ketones as its fuel adding turmeric to your Foods create a lot of positive things one being just feeling more satisfied next thing on the list is zinc if someone going to be excessively hungry next one is something called Kombucha Tea which is not really a tea it carbonated drink it it you just need to drink a half a glass and sip it I like to dilute it with water but it because it called lactic acid that helps feed your gut which will then send signals up to your brain that you also has a certain chemical that can be very satisfying also there chemical that supports the liver that seems to be more satisfying than having regular like saddle like Roma lettuce or something like that also realize when you consume vegetables with fiber or berries with fiber that fiber can buffer the blood sugar anytime you have a meal with fiber you next thing on the list is full fat protein you don protein the leaner the protein as in like whey protein powder the more insulin that there index and at the top of the list you have the highest thing that stimulates insulin as far as not being a carbohydrate and that is whey protein as you come down and have more fat with the protein like a whole egg or more fattier meat or fattier fish you have a lower insulin Spike you the dip in blood sugar because insulin pushes your blood sugars down we want to keep your blood sugars level eating more fat with the protein can help buffer that response eating more fiber also helps buffer the glycemic index as well another thing that can really help your appetite is exercise now here thing if you are exercising too much like high-intensity exercise that could actually drop your blood sugar too low and you can be hungry what I about is long walks something that too intense that can greatly help your blood sugar the next thing on the list and this is really important is getting an extra 30 minutes of sleep whether you take a nap for 30 minutes or you sleep in 30 minutes later that extra sleep greatly reduces cortisol and levels off your blood sugar this leads me to the next thing which is just keeping your stress level as low as possible and to do that you want to do exercise physical work around the house sleep more eat healthy do stretching and take ashwagandha and definitely magnesium glycinate before you go to bed that can greatly help if you combine some of these foods with better sleep less stress you can control your appetite lose weight look good and feel better about yourself	Success
Don't Ignore These Signs!! #vitaminddeficiency	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20vYrMatDzg	Dr. Eric Berg DC	your body is begging for vitamin D if you have any of the following symptoms lower back pain or hip pain or tightness in those areas suspect a vitamin D deficiency next one is inflammation and this could be anywhere in the body vitamin D gives you a potent anti-inflammatory effect it helps to modulate the immune system it means to increase your immune system if your immune system is low or it can bring down your immune system if your immune system is overreacting or there much inflammation if you vitamin D your sleep cycles will be really off let went on a trip across the country then you developed jet leg that can be so quickly resolved if you take enough vitamin D because vitamin D helps to synchronize the little clock in your brain that regulates circadian rhythms if someone they issues eczema or psoriasis all of them can be resolved with having enough vitamin D3 if you vitamin D you developing autoimmune disas diseases like Ms lupus Hashimoto rheumatoid arthritis these are conditions where your own immune system is attacking itself because your immune system has lost control one way to get control back in there is to take more vitamin D3 another problem with vitamin D deficiency is mood disorders this could be anxiety feeling apathetic and being depressed in the winter time when we don enough vitamin D people get respiratory infections this is a classic vitamin D deficiency symptom not having enough vitamin D increases your risk for getting pneumonia the flu a bacterial infection it developing asthma any of the conditions that happen more in the winter versus the summer can be resolved with taking enough vitamin D3	Success
STOP Nighttime Peeing Now: IT REALLY WORKS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEg9b3YPJj0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today I nighttime urination it is not hard to fix this problem if you know the underlying root cause the biggest mistake or problem with people with urinary frequency especially at night they don it you don see results I did another video on this topic a while ago I below I had 10 million views this is an upgrade of that video but if you read the comments on that video it like people are getting results all over the place let me tell you what doesn work thinking that your prostate is the primary problem so many people either take medications or natural things for the prostate doesn frequency of their urination at night sometimes people will say well it urinary tract infection or it stones or it might be but there common the number one most common problem with urinary frequency at night is two much insulin in your blood there resistance which is a situation where your body insulin and then the body has to compensate by sending signals to the pancreas to tell it to produce more insulin there of diabetics that have a problem getting up to the night and urinating very frequently if you do have high blood sugar what the sugar goes the water is going to go any time the sugar is high the body going to get rid of it through the kidneys because it and you frequently it basically means you frequently insulin resistance causes an overactive bladder even if your blood sugar is normal there dogs that they injected with insulin and there urinating more frequently at night urinary frequency at night is an early Sun that you have insulin resistance which is a precursor to diabetes insulin resistance causes your kidney to filter out things more frequently puts more stress on the kidney this is why the main cause of most kidney disease comes from diabetes also insulin resistance causes electrolyte imbalances it affects more blood pressure at night and insulin resistance increases cortisol which can also increase urination insulin resistance in a female now weakens the floor of your bladder and the pelvic muscles insulin resistance also creates a magnesium deficiency which can aggravate this whole problem because you lose control of all these smooth muscles the other interesting thing about insulin resistance is what it does to testosterone it lowers testosterone some people that are treated with testosterone replacement therapy improve their ladder and their symptoms of excessive urination at night as we get older and our testosterone goes down people typically have more problems with their bladder and their control of urine especially at night and what interesting is when people take testosterone replacement therapy they actually can also improve insulin resistance what would cause you to have more insulin resistance at night if you guessed snacking at night you are correct that is the single number one damaging thing to your urination problem out of everything when I snacking I something like this right here or even this right here even if you snacked on something healthy that can also increase your insulin so I recommend that you eliminate all snacks after your dinner don after that period of time because not only does refined carbohydrates and sugar cause insulin resistance but it also just eating in general will raise insulin these snacks also cause bloating before bed they interrupt your sleep here you don up and peeing every few hours that lack of sleep then raises your cortisol it will mess up your blood sugar to the point where it crave more of the snacks at night in between meals also a lot of times people snack because they just out of a habit as a first step if it least snack on something that healthier like blueberries or maybe strawberries or celery or even a grapefruit but it nothing and just get in the habit of not snacking one of the smartest things to do is not to buy any more snack foods because if this is sitting in the pantry and it you these commercials it can just trigger this I one and then one turns into two and three and four and before you know you ate the whole bag when you salt diet you could also have a problem with urination at night just from the fact that what sodium does to your fluid it helps you retain fluid you do need a certain amount of salt in the diet also some people are snacking because they craving salt it could be that you just need to add more salt to your meal through the day so you won craving when you have enough salt your cortisol stays down people that have a salt deficiency usually have higher cortisol and it affects their sleep just make sure you have enough salt sea salt healthy sea salt I like the Himalayan sea salt but there salt that you can consume I talked about not snacking at night but I also have to recommend through the day go on a low carb diet don carbohydrates why because this will make a huge difference in your insulin resistance yes I on the healthy version of the ketogenic diet and I will put a link down below of exactly what that means but equally as important is intermittent fasting starting with three meals no snacks especially not snacking at night and then going down to two meals skip your breakfast have a lunch and a dinner no snacking in between don your calories eat until you satisfied you have to break this habit of snacking I work it able to sleep through the night you feel great in the morning you more energy you when you sleep better even adding 30 more minutes to your sleep is massive as far as health benefits I did a video on this and it heart for your blood sugars for your stress level for your energy for your cognitive function for your uh creativity solving problems it one last thing I make sure you have enough vitamin D vitamin D can help insulin problems insulin resistance it effective to that also it can help with your sleep cycles also make sure when you get vitamin D you add it with magnesium both of those together will greatly help your sleep and I of how much to take Below in the description but if you really want to know what you should be eating I put that video up right here check it out	Success

THIS HAS GOT TO STOP!!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEsPN-9ekiA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	it was funny cuz like our CTO sergy like sent me a message on slack and he uh Claude oh my God and he highly introverted individual doesn get very emotional hardly ever um so for him to say that I across something pretty interesting and and he showed me you know he God you got someone that is getting 91 medications and then you of them in the 60s and the 50s and overall on average I think the number we came up with an average of 48 wow this has got to stop what living homes and the number of medications that these patients are on is just mind-blowing to explain this I going to interview right now the CEO of a company that sells software to manage the medications involved in patients in assisted living homes as we got a sampling of of a 100 residents it was pretty astonishing what we saw and it was funny because like our CTO sergy like sent me a message on slack and he like Claude oh my God and he high introverted individual doesn very emotional hardly ever um so for him to say that I something pretty interesting and he showed me you know he got someone that is getting 91 medications and then you of them in the 60s and the 50s and overall on average I think the number we came up with an average of 48 yeah when I heard that I literally fell off my chair because see I was under the illusion that maybe six at the very most 10 but 48 medications that and there was someone that had 91 medications correct correct oh my gosh Eric imagine the caregiver that has to manage 91 medications every day or maybe every other day some are given Monday Wednesday Friday something like that but just trying to keep track of those along with probably taking care if it large facility you know maybe 5 10 15 other people as well incredibly incredibly it happening you evaluated halil centers and what did you find with his numbers as far as medications once they get on his program I little bit less than 48 it definitely brought a smile to my face because typically kind of being within this industry as well because I used to own three locations as well there goes upwards in terms of prescribed orders it doesn how breath of fresh air you know in October 2023 um his resident had a total of 47 uh prescribed medications as of July 2024 dropped down to 25 that decrease and that just you don writing out this emot um because this is this kind of stuff that you just um this is what you want to see right and it this is really exciting and and what unique about halil he focuses more on diet and he actually gives people real food and he doesn feed them what traditionally is fed which is institutional Foods alra processed foods is there any special diets going on is there anything any emphasis on diet uh in these homes generally there we need to keep sugar away from them or anything like that it focused for a particular condition not an overall health diet is ever described we to low carp or having an emphasis on maybe okay you are you right now let that and get you towards a a better a better healthier stance whether it weight loss or just maybe getting offl of meds you don track box and make sure you have it completed and that assisted living home uh centers they they dementia is like one of the top things is that correct by far I saw statistic that 42% of all residents in assisted living in the United States have dementia if we just look at the cost of care with dementia it on an average person right I mean taxpayers plus the out of pocket for the family have to spend a lot of money is that true for for the lifetime of dementia care I 800,000 and a million and a half per person incredible consider all expenses incredible and it as well does any of those uh family members ever get to go home because they no longer need hospice we people actually move back home wow um dementia is a more challenging condition and one that really needs effective treatment or prevention early on as you probably know Eric the dementia starts in your 30s and 40s it not just suddenly hits you in your 60s or 70s um so if you wait a really long time it brain heals slower than the body but you do see memory improvement even in the people we don improved uh scores on the mocha and slums test wow I would imagine the diet for people in assisted living is the exact same thing in nursing homes as well as in hospitals I would agree as well as our Public Schools I think and our prisons um it stems from the FDA food guidelines in fact that use as Guidance with the CDC and with our Arizona Department of Health so the the trick is we need to change the guidelines at the source and you it proliferate out I think throughout the whole of society well I saw a recent comment by the committee members that were on the dietary guideline they basically their stances there is no hard evidence or strong evidence to show that alter processed foods contribute to someone Health in one way or another my thought is do we need an experiment to even do on that can see what people eat and just look at what they look like I mean do we we been doing an experiment for the last 50 years the food guidelines have been in in place since the 1970s and and just look at the health of the country since the 1970s I don what bigger contributing factor to your health can be than what you put in your mouth the system of medicine is medicine it it of that this whole thing is held together these medications are treating the side effects from the junk food then there creating more side effects that then are treated by more medication I mean this is like a paradigm that needs to be changed and so I think looking at root causes which is Lifestyle Changes which at the core of it is your diet needs to be brought up and we need to educate people because um somehow uh it got corrupted well a doctor going to get sued for not recommending a diet if a doctor removes you from statins and you have a heart attack he opening himself up for liability if you are on Statin and you have a heart attack he can say well I was following the standard of care all the incentives are lining up to move away from eating right deprescribing medications things like that Claude has a phenomenal piece of software it my assisted living homes and it does everything the Department of Health requires us to do to remain in compliance with all their rules and regulations but like he said he didn put anything in the software to encourage a healthy or good diet because he was looking at what the rules and regulations were and there there about that everything that we develop and we we produce it Demand right what is requested the most and and this should be at the top of the list right we should be promoting more and more health and wellness um so honestly I mean just like what this experience you know going going through and and Mining this data it it did something it did something internally even to our Tech Team right and these guys write code you know but it much more than that when they start seeing that you know my gosh you know these this is someone is someone some code to contribute to help benefit somebody and to prolong their life and their wellbeing and in this case h i mean with your your perspective is like hey if I can get you that healthy to get you out of here I winning right that philosophy that that guy that you talked about that you tracked in your software for me Claud is now living on his own in an apartment with his dog goes out walking with his dog every day I again next week so you think this is a great conversation to start and then start to dig deeper into this to see what we can do to put it on the map definitely just so they can start to uh at least recognize the problem as a first step because it been hidden I was under the under the delusion that maybe at the very most it was 10 medications but 48 is I think um slightly too high I want to continue this conversation and I want to ask you this if we took someone like you and I presume that you you on 48 different medications what would happen to your body first of all I don healthy to take 48 medications because they would probably be severely sick but I was just thinking about it if I took 48 medications right now what would that do to my health we things that are going to make my liver very very toxic we don treating what I have a copy right now of pages and pages of just one patient with all the medications blood pressure medications cholesterol medications medications for a Tremor medications for blood clot stool softener several anti-depressants medication for seizures insulin schizophrenia runny nose nauseousness prostate enlargement this is completely insane when I was in practice I would always ask this patient what are you eating this question is never never asked if you actually omit the diet piece of the puzzle in an evaluation you are missing the core cause because if you don symptoms ever going to go away why is there not a coordinated effort to find the underlying cause masking a symptom is not improving your health I saying the doctors are bad it system that we very very rich but it keeps the patient very very sick sometimes you hear well we still need more research to understand how diet influences our health well you could just look on my website drberg.com and I have over 8,000 success stories because of one main thing changing the diet has created profound effects on their body really what I with help of big Pharma is treating the side effect from the alra processed food calories AKA junk food as you can see in this interview things keep getting worse and worse please tell me what you think about this problem and what we need to do to solve it	Success
End Dry Cough in 5 Minutes Â HereÂs How!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6xyOtp5sIE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today we get rid of a cough within 5 minutes or less you have a mucus cough and then you have a non- mucus cough which is called a dry cough the remedy that I talk about will work on both but there nothing worse than having this dry cough while you problem with most remedies for coughs they are going to give you a medication that suppresses the cough if we think about what the reason why you coughing in the first place is your body is coughing as a vital defense mechanism because there or it could be a virus or some type of irant that your body wants resolved the perfect remedy for a cough has to align with the actual cause of that cough coughing can come from a postnasal drip you have this sinus infection that causing this irritation down your throat this can relate to an allergy a cold a virus fungal infection this dry cough can also relate to a side effect from certain medications you to do something to find some alternative to really get rid of your coughing you can also have gird gastro esophagal reflux disease where this coughing is coming from Acid that is coming up through this valve on the top of your stomach coming all the way up through here and if you suspect that being a cause I of how to fix this problem the solution is not to take another anti acid it just that the valve is not closing and then this acid is regurgitating up the fix the valve there that another cause of coughing is asthma so many young children develop asthma when they mother did not have enough vitamin D apparently vitamin D deficiency early on sets you up for asthma down the road because you need Vitamin D to help form the lungs correctly realize anyone with a asthma problem needs a lot of vitamin D to put that into remission people that get asthma usually get it more in the winter I wonder why because we get less vitamin D there cro which you see in young children which is kind of like a barking cough it for that is also vitamin D another cause could be there humidity in the air when the humidity gets below 30% which means the moisture in the air is very sparse then what happens is that we get a dehydration or drying out out of our throat and our sinuses this can irritate the vocal cords and you can start coughing this also could be compounded with the fact that your vents are dirty maybe they have mold in it and you this dry hot air coming in that irritating your throat and the solution for that is to get a a humidifier to actually moisten the air in your room especially when you go to sleep another common cause of this dry cough is a spasm in your larynx it spasm if you look this up one of the causes is low calcium in the blood called hypo calcemia calcium is needed to help facilitate the nerve communication in the throat if you don have enough calcium then we don the signaling then we get a misfire into the cough reflex because there nerve endings in that area why would you have low calcium in the blood well there missing in most people and that vitamin D3 one of the big purposes of vitamin D3 is to increase inre amount of calcium in the blood and if you in vitamin D you enough calcium and then that affect your vocal cords and then causes cough in practice I used to give people calcium I think a better remedy would be to give them more vitamin D3 at least 20,000 I use every single day that will automatically increase the calcium and help the throat you have to make sure when you take vitamin D3 always take it with magnesium that was recommend also taking with vitamin K2 there things that can cause this uh chronic coughing could be perfumes smoke it can be having some news furniture that you bought that giving off some chemicals in your environment there of tick disorders as in Tourette Syndrome that can also affect this coughing now let most potent remedy for this dry cough now I and I talk about consuming honey ginger tea thyme oregano all of those are great and even gargling with salt water is really good but there lot better this is going to be put in a nebulizer that is something that turns a liquid into a fine Mist like a vapor because you and it it going to calm everything down very quickly it effective and you can use it for both a cough related to mucus and a dry cough the first remedy is called NAC n acetal cysteine this is a very potent antioxidant anti-inflammatory it the lungs your natural detoxifier in your liver it COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease you powder and you of a teaspoon and you dissolve it in 4 oz of water you going to keep mixing until it completely dissolves it wouldn water because when it going to dissolve a little bit better once the NAC dissolves you add one more thing magnesium in the form of epson salts we we powerful about magnesium magnesium is needed for vitamin D to work vitamin D will not work unless you have magnesium not only that magnesium also controls calcium it controls where calcium goes after the NAC is dissolved into that 4 ounces of water and you it into that liquid that you already dissolved the NAC and you dissolve it into that fluid as well in a nebulizer which you breathe in for 5 minutes one or two times per day this combination is going to work way better than any of those other combinations I videos there are a lot of different things you can do that will work but this is the most powerful but just as a side note black seed oil will work as well white Horehound and at the same time you 20,000 IUS of vitamin D3 with vitamin K2 with magnesium sometimes it also comes with zinc that would be also really good that is ultimately going to correct this problem but this other combination is a quick fix and it you get rid of this fast so you can sleep through the night and you can stop coughing thank you so much for watching and I will see you in the next video	Success
Egg Prices Are NOT by Accident	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyX98bnDaow	Dr. Eric Berg DC	what is going on now with bird flu is very close to an exact replay of what happened with Co egg prices are not something that is random it else and you have to follow the money today we really behind the scarcity of eggs the price I doctor of internal medicine for over 25 years Doc it you have some amazing insights to this bird flu which is a bit of a day ja Vu of a Playbook that I think just happened recently I wanted to bring you on because maybe you can kind of give us the simple version of what potentially could be going on as far as could this be something that is accidental or maybe manufactured yes well thanks for having me very much I appreciate the opportunity to be here and to speak and thanks for taking time to read my article if we just use basic pattern recognition skills we can see that what is going on now with bird flu is very close to an exact replay of what happened with covid what we see is a several step process by which people intentionally are creating fear and creating a pandemic or a attempting to create a pandemic um in order to obtain some kind of control over us um this is clearly what happened in with covid as you know even the CIA has admitted now that the virus came out of the lab in Wuhan that it was an engineered virus around 2012 or somewhere about thereabouts was found in a cave of bats in China and was brought to the lab and was manipulated for several years to essentially weaponize it late in 2019 that virus was released whether it was intentional or unintentional it remains unclear but it definitely came out of the lab they allowed the world military games which is an Olympic type event to take place in Wuhan China of all places brought all kind of people from all over the world um allowed it to spread and then by early 2020 it was um declared to be this pandemic we had all of these civil rights uh violations locking us down not allowing us to earn a living in the name of protecting us from this virus they have a countermeasure and the countermeasure is to develop these vaccines they could compel us they could kind of coers us into taking these highly profitable and turns out quite toxic vaccines for what reason um because they would make a lot of money and because they would exert uh control over us to continue to take these vaccines in the future so now let forward to what with the bird flu there are multiple Labs that have taken a previously naturally occurring h5n1 um bird flu they manipulating in the lab doing gain of function which means trying to make it more transmissible and more virulent and in fact they to get it to jump species which is there The prominent labs in the United States that are doing this are the southeast poultry research laboratory which is owned and operated by our own USDA is doing this crazy research in Athens Georgia and it this is the location by which the current um circulating clade as they call it of this virus uh leaked out of now whether it leaked out intentionally or unintentionally I don we came from and Peter molik and Nick huler and some other people have done some incredible work to trace incredible detective work to trace this down they bothered to try and refute it of course our FDA is now claiming that they doing all they can to contain this where when in fact they they almost certainly leaked the virus out I don whether it was intentional or not the other uh lab and there that do this type of gain of function research on bird flu that implicated in this is at University Wisconsin veterinary school there guy a Japanese national by the name of yoshihiro kawaoka he many years funded by all kinds of sources he by Gates that Foundation does all kinds of of just really ill-advised stuff President Obama back in 2014 put a temporary ban on gain of fun and research in the United States some of the people that blew the whistle on you wouldn the big apologists for vaccines was one of the people who was so alarmed by what this guy kaloku was doing that even he blew the whistle on him Anthony fouchi found a way around this largely by Outsourcing the stuff to China for the the Corona virus work and and to some extent just ignoring Obama that people are now you lab manipulated viruses that are out there and fortunately what we in the population uh is not as bad as they getting sick occasional cows that are getting the virus as well although the cows don of any there may be some but I aware of any cow deaths and 67 human beings in North America in the last couple years have gotten this and for the overwhelming majority of them it been conjunc divid it was one report of a person who died in Louisiana with the bird flu they would not go so far as to say that the person died of the bird flu although some of the media Outlets claimed that but that has not been stated they are encouraging the farmers to do willy-nilly PCR testing on their flocks if they test positive what they slaughtering the entire flock if so much as one bird test positive for the illness a PCR test which has a lot of false positives they have one positive they will kill the entire flock some of these Farms have millions of chickens correct correct so they can kill hundreds of thousands maybe millions of birds at once because of one or two positive PCR tests that is important for for listeners to know that shortage is not because the birds are dying of the bird flu the shortage is because they if there number of positive tests have you heard anything about this happening in smaller backyard uh Farms people having chickens in their backyards is that occurring in that environment at all or is it just mainly the industrial chicken farms it an excellent question I don definitive answer but what I would say is that supposedly this individual that got extremely sick in Louisiana caught it from their backyard chicken farm however the the what of eggs to go up is this ridiculous policy of slaughtering whole flocks when you have one or few positive tests and of course they to just to show you how dishonest the whole process is they call it calling well you can look the definition of calling in the dictionary it has nothing to do with Mass Slaughter Mass Slaughter is the opposite of calling that process is and according to the sources I taxpayer dollars over 1.25 billion to fund this Mass Slaughter of these animals so we are paying with our own tax dollars to kill these animals to drive up food prices to make a shortage of eggs and this is driving this whole thing not the the flu itself basically the farmers get paid for that loss from the taxpayers correct so the the farmers have a perverse incentive and I don the farmers are caught between a rock and a hard place they government coming in and telling them we need to test your birds but don if they test positive we them and we price maybe more in order to solve the problem what it artificially creating a shortage it artificially creating uh fear it artificially creating a crisis instead of locking us all down and holding us hostage physically or metaphorically until we accept the human vaccines what they destroying important element of our food supply unless we allow them to mass vaccinate all these birds so that really the agenda is they want to mass vaccinate now entire Farms that really what they want to do there other way around it because right before before um Trump took office what did they do they gave a conditional um approval to zotis which is a very large animal vaccine company couple days before Trump was inaugurated the Biden Administration gave a 590 million Grant to our old friends madna to start developing mr& based Technologies for bird flue so you you know so again what does it come down to we come down to it just like with a big payoff for madna to force us all to accept mRNA vaccines what do we really need to do to to stop this what are some things that uh need to happen we need to acknowledge what going on um this is not a bunch of well-meaning scientists trying to Stamp Out disease this is a criminal Enterprise this is basically a a protection racket you know nice little farm you got there it anything were to happen to it don worry we we pay you off to do whatever we want with it if Paul offet could figure it out in 2012 and Barack Obama could figure out in 2014 why on Earth after all this we are we not realizing it right now this gain of function research has to stop you know I know you don Godzilla you know and this is what they are doing they create Godzilla so we can create a vaccine against Godzilla what on Earth are we doing here unfortunately you can but I think things are going to change primary target needs to be shutting down these G of function laps immediately because uh it those it weapons that are Against Humanity it is completely criminal and insane to the end degree so many people are embedded in this to some extent or another and I think some people that are low to midlevel don they believe that what they do is appropriate um I a funny story um one of the people who is a placeholder at HHS or rather the CDC right now he was the former State Health commissioner in Maine during covid so very much in in line with the lockdowns and all that kind of stuff one of the things that website is that he was involved back earlier in his career with bird flu mitigation in Cambodia now of course Cambodia is a relatively poor country in southeast Asia where supposedly these viruses originate the current recommendations in Cambodia where about 95% of chickens are owned by Family Farms you know maybe 50 to 100 chickens maximum is if your bird gets sick you separate the bird from the rest of the flock preferably you sacrifice that animal don common sense one solution too is to have a lot more small farms and start buying eggs from smaller farms uh your local farmers markets find a local farmer because um that way we we keep things not so um centralized where all of our eggs are in one basket s to speak yes I agree I is that this is interesting I agree with you 100% recently in England which of course is a UK is just an absolute mess in so many different ways but UK is trying to force people I don exactly where it to force people to register any home home poultry that they have and the um the National Association for veterinary medicine which is highly beholden to Pharma um is has put out a release recently that you know uh small family um poultry Holdings may be a risk to Public Health so don they your backyard chickens it run and hide from this so we have to take action we have to make sure that these people are stopped I really appreciate you doing work consolidating all this information and making it uh easy to understand and for those of you watching spread this video out to your friends and family because we need to get the word out so we don this Mass agreement that this is what we want we want to we want to change and I this data goes right into the new Administration so they can do something about it thank you so much Dr Baker I really appreciate you coming on and uh we collaborate very soon very good thanks for having me I appreciate it absolutely	Success
#1 Best Remedy for POOR Eyesight (Especially Over 50!)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bksYSwtJVM0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let remedy for cataracts did you realize that one in four people over the age of 65 has a cataract and by the time they reach 80 years old one and two people will have a cataract 28,000 people a day worldwide develop cataracts many people actually go blind because of it all it takes is a little bit of oxidative stress the lens of the eye to start developing cataracts oxida stress is kind of like a rusting out of a tissue normally in the lens of the eye you have this organ ized protein this protein is called crystallin it proteins you have in your body because you developed it when you were in an embo before you were actually born problem with this protein is it never gets replaced like other tissues it not like your liver that can regenerate because once you start getting damage in the lens that tissue does not replace over time you have a lot of things that can damage the lens something called glycation glycation is where you have a sugar that connects with a protein and it gets stuck and now it becomes unusable to the body that protein becomes damaged this is why a lot of diabetics develop cataracts earlier than they should of course as we age we also develop them also steroids can really affect the eye if you for example glycation for too much sugar or oxidation without having enough antioxidants built up in the lens of the eye problem is the lens of the eye becomes kind of frosted looking through a dirty lens where you can out out of it then people get surgery not all surgeries can cure it and there are definitely complications there remedy or an antidote to cataracts that is very effective and it this video is on this book right here by a British medical doctor I summarize the book and then I link down below of the book so you can check it out if you want to get it in this book the doctor talks about several remedies or antidotes some drug approaches like metformin and other diabetic medication which they have side effects but he also talks about some natural things that also work very well and one is a very specific form of carnosine carnosine is a very unique compound that can be combined in a certain form that allows it to be transported through the eye and penetrate the lens it potent antioxidant that has the potential to dissolve these damaged proteins in the eye not to mention it actually activates your own antioxidants the solution is not to take it as a supplement but to take it in a drop form but not as carnosine because if you just take straight carnosine in a drop and you put it in the eyes it won what you have to do is you have to combine it with a few things to allow it to be carried through the eye into the lens because the lens is a little bit deeper into the eye you need carnosine in this form n acetal kosine NAC it can be transported to the eye and once it gets in the eye into the fluid around the lens then it breaks apart and allows the carnosine to do its magic during an experiment performed at the Moscow hem Holtz Research Institute of eye diseases scientists have used NAC ey drops 1% concentration on rabbits in the laboratory they compared this treatment with inactive eye drops NAC was able to reach the inner parts of the eye after about 15 to 30 minutes during this process NAC was broken down which is then free to work against lication in the lens of the eye you also have a lot of membranes in there the carnosine can penetrate and navigate through the fat membranes and so it reaches deep into the cell during this experiment no side effects were reported the authors concluded that NAC is proposed as a treatment for eye disorders including cataracts glaucoma corneal disorders inflammation and complications from diabetes why would it improve complications of diabetes Well because diabetes increases your risk for cataracts the ey is one of the big targets for diabetes a group of scientists who performed an earlier rabbit experiments study the effects of NAC drops on humans the scientist selected 49 volunteers with an average age of 65 years who had established age related cataracts they then divided the patients into three groups group one they treated with a 1% solution of Na eye drops group two was only treated with the placebo eye drops and group three was left untreated the the patients were examined at 2 to 6 months intervals after 6 months approximately 41% of eyes treated with NAC presented a significant reduction in the clouding of the lens 90% of the treated eyes showed a gradual Improvement of vision 89% of the eyes showed up to a 100% Improvement of sensitivity to glare I mean just think about what they did they used a natural remedy with very little side effects if any to help get rid of cataracts let me also answer two questions out of the book how long do I need to use the drops for a cataract at least 3 to five months because it an overnight thing it while before it actually corrects everything you you natural and it slowly dissolve some of these proteins that are damaging or clouding the eye in this video I claiming that this natural remedy can cure anything I information to maybe take a look at it another interesting thing about these NAC drops is that when you search for them on Amazon you can mean it time ago but now you can see a different type of NAC drops but not the N acetal carnosine drops however I did find a couple sources where you can find these drops online but not necessarily on Amazon and I will put those links down below what lessons can we learn from this video the risk factors diet diabetes consuming junk Foods steroids are all things that speed up the process of cataracts seed oils are the worst of the worst I would avoid those antioxidants can protect you against cataracts and I onions for example is a good antioxidant egg yolks leafy green vegetables grass-fed red meat also can help you build up antioxidants to help fight these things vitamin A is also really important in the eyes this is why how liver oil is a good source vitamin A and so is uh grass-fed liver and lastly the B vitamins specifically B6 and B2 and folate very important for the eyes my goal is to give people alternative solutions that don side effects that can work on a natural level yet also tell you how to get to the root cause thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video	Success
CRITICAL: Detoxify Your Brain from Microplastics	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1whvDMDogU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today I important topic how to detoxify the plastic out of your brain the microplastics the brain accumulates the most microplastics of all of the organs the brain accumulates 7 to 30 times more microplastics than the liver in the kidneys today I how to get rid of this plastic not just the Plastics but something else called Forever chemicals they bind with proteins in your blood creating all sorts of problems especially as they built up in it over time this is a very important video because if you can do something about this now you can prevent a lot of problems down the road in one report that I saw an average person has 7 G of plastic in their brain the first thing you need to know about Plastics is the big scam about plastic recycling as simply a way to get you to keep buying plastic items only 9% of all the Plastics are able to be recycled the vast majority of Plastics either they incinerated or the great majority of it sinks to the bottom of the ocean if you look on the the bottom of the plastic containers you like a recycling symbol just gives an impression that oh yeah oh this can be recycled well check out this clip right here recycling is expensive and labor intensive and making new plastic from fossil fuels is almost always cheaper forever Plastic industry documents clearly concluded that there were no effective Market mechanisms for mixed plastic and that there is serious doubt that it can ever be made viable on an economic basis there was never an enthusiastic belief that uh recycling was ultimately going to work in a significant way I think they knew that the infrastructure wasn amount to a whole lot if the public thinks the recycling is working then they about the environment I will let you know there are certain technologies that are being created right now using microbes that eat plastic and fungi that can eat plastic there are certain types of enzymes that are developed that can eat plastic but until those are developed there you can do number one avoid Plastics which I two we can do things in our body to help detoxify some of this plastic in Forever chemicals let brain there is a type of lymphatic system in our brain it dishwasher it helps clean up stuff that system really occurs when you a really good amount of Deep Sleep high quality deep sleep is going to be necessary to help get rid of Plastics in your brain another way we can get rid of plastics is by inducing something called autophagy where you of this toxicity the best way to induce autophagy is through fasting you need to fast for at least 18 hours to get into some significant amount of autophagy the thing with plastic sticks and forever chemicals is it creates a lot of oxidative stress which you can counter if you have a strong antioxidant systems in the body consuming foods high in Sulfur that would be garlic onions cruciferous vegetables there natural remedies called NAC milk thistle TKA are all great remedies now let into the probably the most important thing to get rid of the forever chemicals as well as the Plastics if you have City water boy you have to get a water filter that can help remove plastic find a good one with really good reviews or a whole house unit let through some other really important things because you surprised how you just with your routine that you do on a daily basis with cooking plastic cutting boards need to go you need to replace those with wood cutting boards because as you just kind of breaking up the plastic particles and putting them right in the food next one dishwasher pod you put these little pods in there and you don even probably think twice you need to replace those like I did with something that doesn have plastic so you want to get some coffee filters if you use them the ones that are more certified biodegradable and as far as your sea salt goes I would highly recommend getting a sea salt from an ancient seabed not from the ocean because unfortunately there are Plastics in the ocean that end up in the salt even tea bags can have plastic get the tea bags that are more natural and then our plastic Freight baby bottles of course breastfeeding is the best thing to do but if you can glass bottle now the problem is the nipple is usually plastic and you can use a glass nipple it really hard to find a completely plastic free nipple even if you get like the little nipple for the bottle and it going to be a little bit better I would go with that I would definitely start getting a stainless steel water bottle instead of the plastic bottles and fill your own water with the water that you can trust when you store and you get the plasticfree sponges and I putting this on your radar because you probably didn thing but you just need to be aware of it here this plastic the inside layer of cans even the canned carbonated water that I used to drink a lot of I no longer drink canned water cans are lined with this thin layer of plastic you don that I would avoid canned food canned liquids what about toothbrushes they have bamboo toothbrushes that actually has the brushes out of bamboo not plastic again another Simple Solution it doesn trying to do is lessen the load of plastics on your body your cookware uh the Teflon get rid of those pots replace it with stainless steel or ceramic I would never heat anything in the microwave in plastic ever also get glass containers to store your food in not the Plastics as much as you can of course if you that you put in the microwave it completely lined with that plastic really be careful of what you put in the microwave dental floss is another hidden source of some plastic I going to give you a lot but there are dental floss products that don Plastics or forever chemicals tampons get the 100% organic cotton tampons if you start now reducing the load of plastics and forever chemicals on your body this will prevent a lot of problems down the road and I preventing things unfortunately medicine is not about preventing things medicine is about doing screenings when you get older every six months to kind of oh we state so then we can treat it with medication early that screenings are not prevention what I talking about in this video is actual prevention so make note spread the word and I will see you in the next video	Success
10,000 IU of Vitamin D: HUGE MISTAKE?!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sn7T46fCjLE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	10,000 international units of vitamin D3 is this a huge mistake or a miracle cure he talked to an average person about vitamin D they taking 600 IUS of vitamin D3 sometimes up to a th000 maybe 2,000 but when you talk about 10,000 I use some people actually freak out because 10,000 sounds like a very very large number especially compared to something like vitamin B1 which the recommendations for that is like 1.2 mg if you were to convert 10,000 international units of vitamin D3 into milligrams the number would only be .25 milligrams that milligram today we about why an average person should be taking 10,000 IUS of vitamin D3 as a maintenance dosage every single day vitamin D is the most important vitamin why because it controls 10% of all your genetics over 90% of population has less than 40 nog per milliliter of vitamin D3 which actually is on the low side the guidelines for 600 international units of vitamin D3 were based on preventing rickets they health and calcium in the blood they not based on supporting everything else that vitamin D does think about how many people are inside people don outside anymore and then you also have where you live if you northern part of the world it difficult to get vitamin D3 I want to explain something called The Shadow rule if you longer than you are tall you are not getting any vitamin D just because of the angle where the sun is to the Earth you also can glass so when you and you glass you creating uh vitamin D the darker your skin the less vitamin D you absorb dark skin individuals need 10 times more exposure to the Sun to get the same amount of vitamin D3 and if they don the common symptoms are going to get lower back pain or achiness especially that radiates into the hip or the thighs very tight muscles in the lower back blood pressure will start to go up because something called nitric oxide the thing that really controls blood pressure is stimulated by vitamin D3 another common symptom of vitamin D deficiency is depression or even anxiety if you system cannot work you susceptible to having just inflammation anywhere in the body what about all these facial creams that women use putting sunblocker in so many facial creams and makeups now it to block your vitamin D3 in 1980 our whole society became Sun phobic we want to prevent skin cancer here problem since 1980 melanoma has continue to go up obviously the sun wasn cause of it because most melanoma skin cancer occurs in areas of your body where you viewpoint is that melanoma really comes from low vitamin D but that different video for all these functions in the body especially the immune system you need at least 10,000 IUS every single day which is the same thing of being out in the sun for 20 minutes in the summertime I mean that there resistance when they test your vitamin D in your blood they active form of vitamin D they checking this inactive form vitamin D has to go from the inactive to the active through various steps and then it has to be accepted into the vitamin D receptor there block the vitamin D receptor genetics a lot of people have genetic issues with the vitamin D receptor and you can get your DNA test to figure that out another really big thing that will block your vitamin D absorption is Plastics this is a huge problem in our society right now we are just being filled with plastics and other chemicals they called Forever chemicals which are interfering with our biological chemistry especially the absorption of vitamin D3 as well as the production of testosterone as you age it because your skin is thicker if you are overweight have irritable bowel syndrome or any inflammation your gut you going to have a hard time absorbing being vitamin D3 being pregnant breastfeeding very very important to take more vitamin D3 I would recommend 10,000 I use every single day and that a very conservative number on top of all of that magnesium is the most important other nutrient to factor in when you taking vitamin D3 because vitamin D3 won you increase your vitamin D3 the demand for magnesium goes up too vitamin D gives a broad spectrum of positive effects helping prevent cancer to shrinking tumors but you need therapeutic dosage to do that any inflammation in the body and especially autoimmune diseases if someone has an autoimmune disease which a lot of people do nowadays they need much higher amounts of vitamin D3 there in Brazil that specializes in autoimmune diseases he has over a thousand videos of before and afters using high doses of vitamin D3 for just about every single autoimmune disease that you can imagine his wife had Ms guess how much vitamin D she iuse of vitamin D3 every single day if you effect for certain diseases I think it important to work with a doctor that specializes in that that knows about it that can check various things in your blood to make sure that you don develop too much calcium in the blood but if you look at the data you to take hundreds of thousands of vitamin D3 for months to create this hyper calmic effect and I will put a link down below of a group of doctors that you can contact to see if you can work with one of them if you therapeutic dosages to correct a disease if you wanted a really good home test to be able to test yourself with vitamin D and you don this I put a link down below of a great company that can do that through an organization that supports the science of vitamin D3 so there information and I down below and then if it find out what you can do to raise it and then maintain it at a certain level because addressing this vitamin D deficiency is the lowest hanging fruit of creating the most health with the least amount of effort money complications without risking any type of safety issues it our bodies were designed to get a lot of sun but unfortunately nowadays we don get enough Sun we change our lifestyle and get more sun or at least take more vitamin D3 and I would recommend as a minimum dosage just as a maintenance dosage 10,000 I use of vitamin D3 I would make sure it also has K2 magnesium and zinc with that vitamin D3	Success
This One Video Could Save MILLIONS of Lives!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo	Dr. Eric Berg DC	unfortunately in the medical profession they don deeper basically I and I what you never want to just treat the symptom without finding the root cause for example the ridges on the nail are the tip of the iceberg they don I have ridges on my nails there are several connections between Ridge nails and a nutrient deficiency you have to kind of know the potential causes but the question is how do we know which one of those potential causes is the cause there that are going to create the vertical ridges number one an iron deficiency number two a zinc deficiency and number three a biotin deficiency biotin is a B vitamin basically what I do with to figure this out is I iron and I to find out if they are iron deficient and if that female are you menstrating too much do you have symptoms of an you you tired a lot do they get weak easily of course I they a vegan because vegans never eat red meat and red meat is loaded with iron and when you consume plants like spinach there not very bioavailable I also know that someone could actually have a genetic problem with iron where they have too much iron this is interesting because if they have too much iron they going to be anemic because it dysfunctional ask them questions about their liver do they they have a history of curosis of the liver do they feel better when they donate blood have you ever had a genetic test where they said something about iron I iron deficiency or an iron excess I might ask a question like do you crave ice and even people that crave dirt are deficient in iron and then I also might ask them are they cold do they have cold feet cold hands and that just would kind of give me a clue if it iron deficiency based on those questions but of course I ask them those questions I shift also to some other questions to rule out is it a zinc deficiency do they ever have a problem with getting sick frequently and taking a long time to overcome an infection I them about testosterone because zinc definitely helps increase testosterone and let rectile dysfunction or a loss of muscle mass that could help me kind of associate those symptoms with the cause I will also ask them when they driving at night do they have a difficult time seeing in the dark night blindness is usually a vitamin A deficiency but zinc is also necessary for vitamin A to work and this is all related to a certain pigment in the eye that allows you to see in dim light as far as hair goes alopecia would be One symptom of a zinc deficiency I going to ask them about their skin do they have any skin rashes inflammation of the skin is definitely related to zinc I might also ask them do they drink a lot of alcohol or do they eat junk foods which will really deplete you of zinc then I also might ask them about the foods related to zinc because you going to get a lot of zinc if you have red meat but also shellfish uh Seafood things like that after I have those questions I deficiency questions what biotin is that a good percentage of your biotin is made by your own microbes I will ask them do you have a history of a lot of antibiotics because that to destroy the microbes that make biotin then I their hair break easily is their nail thin that on if it when people just bang their nail on something and it just breaks could be a biotin deficiency as well if someone very severely deficient in biotin they problems it neuropathy in their feet so that would be something I would also look for but what you need to know is biotin zinc and iron all control collagen and if you deficient in those you make the collagen necessary for the nail to be formed correctly after assessing all these questions it very easy for me to isolate the real underlying cause or the most likely cause which then I will either recommend eating more of that food or I will recommend consuming it as a supplement as far as iron goes I never like recommending an iron supplement because it types of iron that they give people I might uh recommend grass-fed liver pills or spleen extract pills they work great or just consume more red meat that iron then of course with zinc the best source of zinc is shellfish oysters are the top of the list but you can also get a good amount of zinc and grass-fed beef as far as a zinc supplement I would recommend taking probably 50 milligrams of zinc in a blend of other trace minerals that include copper because anytime you take zinc in higher amounts over a long period of time they can deplete you of copper I like my zinc to be in a blend of trace minerals with copper you always want to have 10 times as much zinc as copper so it would be like a 1 to 10 ratio and this is a very rough estimate so if you of zinc you have 1 milligram of copper then we get to biotin if we need more biotin I would recommend taking a supplement but here don supplement that has the most biotin because there have like 30,000 times the the RDA so you don need to go that extreme but I do know a lot of people take B boy their nails get really super strong as far as reestablishing biotin in your body like consuming Foods it necessarily going to be adding certain foods that will increase biotin because biotin is in so many different foods as it is to build up your gut microbiome and for that you want to take a good probiotic or consume foods that are fermented one other interesting thing about biotin is if you consume raw egg whites you can become biotin deficient because there white of the egg that blocks your ability to absorb biotin I just wanted to give you a simple example of the best way to figure things out is not to treat this tip of the iceberg to find out what every effect or symptom there all 5700 videos that I have are all about making these connections and this is a huge gap within our health care System they don they just treat the symptom as a problem and it covers up the real problem thank you for watching and I will see you in the next video	Success
7 Warning Signs of a Dangerous Nutrient Deficiency	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_PpwqcQ-I	Dr. Eric Berg DC	today I strange signs that your body is begging for iodine and the last one number seven is going to be the most important and the most interesting the iodine in our soils have been depleted over the years iodine is not in the soil it to end up in the grass if it the grass it animal and if it the animal that deficiency in you back in the 40s there was a huge uh problem with goers where you have this enlarged thyroid and that was an iodine deficiency in certain parts of the country this is when they introduced iodized salt but then in the 70s you know this whole iodized salt kind of disappeared and it was replaced with sea salt problem is there lot of iodine in sea salt the combination of not getting enough iodine from our Foods on top of that there certain things that will deplete iodine like the fluoride in your water the chlorine in the water especially if someone is a vegan they foods high in iodine and more if someone goes more vegetarian or vegan the less they shellfish Dairy eggs Seafood that normally contain iodine let this list right now number one if someone starts losing the outer onethird of their eyebrows you can see I losing my eyebrows they but if you start losing this part right here suspect you are iodine deficient number two hair loss iodine is crucial in making sure you have enough thyroid hormones that support your hair and one of the biggest symptoms of a hypo low thyroid situation is hair loss number three heness almost like there in your throat and that is because the thyroid is enlarging because it to reach out and grab onto some iodine that puts pressure on your vocal cords which can not only affect your voice but it can affect other errors as well number four is an enlarged tongue your tongue starts to get bigger and the way that you enlarged is you part of the tongue and you little indentations suspect you are deficient in iodine number five unexplained weight gain for no reason you not doing anything out of the usual you just find your metabolism is just super slow suspect an iodine efficiency because the iodine is not supporting the master metabolism gland in the body called the thyroid gland you notice that you all over equally not necessarily in one place number six your estrogen is going to go up that can show up as a heavy period or heavy cramping or headaches that time of the month even waking in your hips but then on the flip side you might find that your testosterone is low not just in men but in women as well without a fully functioning thyroid your estrogen testosterone is going to be low so many men are deficient in iodine they can make enough testosterone the testosterone is not activated a lot of men find that just when they reintroduce iodine into their diet that handles their low testosterone right off the bat testosterone is not just about libido testosterone is a very potent anti-inflammatory it helps certain things in your immune system reduce inflammation testosterone is all about preventing the loss of muscle both in men and women testosterone also supports your bone health so if you in testosterone you may find that you getting osteoporosis or even osteopenia number seven is the most interesting and most important about iodine when you are deficient in iodine your IQ will be lower this is not just in small children it your cognitive function from different angles number one the thyroid directly affects the brain there the brain that have a lot of concentrated receptors for thyroid hormones one is something called a Hipp campus which is all about executive function making decisions problem solving giving you enough attention and focus certain people are more susceptible to this problem if the child is 1 2 3 years old into development it very important for them to get enough iodine if you you cerebral cortex as well as your hippocampus and this is going to show up in the inability to remember certain things have a strong amount of attention and focus on certain things problem solving functions overall creativity will be diminished the interesting thing about the IQ is that yes it over the last 40 years IQ has been decreasing but it measure the actual IQ over time because there everyone does over the years this test has been altered and changed the way that we deliver this test has been changed if we measured the IQ from someone in the 50s versus now it apples and oranges the glitch in this whole IQ test is we your IQ with someone from 1950 with the same test no we the average IQ from a random sampling the IQ has been dropping but you going to necessarily see it because we keep readjusting the normal it similar to when you test testosterone now we know in 1950 testosterone for someone 50 years old was a certain amount and now it you look at the normal ranges those normal ranges are based on the average of the population basically comparing you to a bunch of unhealthy people yes there are other factors the school system the way we time overall nutrition but we can forget about iodine and just some random assessments looking at urine iodine levels from 1990 to present time we at a 50% less iodine level the most important thing about iodine is to provide the thyroid enough of its trace minerals for these thyroid hormones to work thyroid hormones go into every part of the body they affect both the ovines and the testicles they help regulate or modulate or control estrogen dominance thyroid hormones directly help cognitive function as well as your mood people with a low thyroid are usually depressed and if we thyroid we condition and by the way hypothyroidism is one of the most common health problems worldwide there partner Trace mineral that important in Hashimoto which is the autoimmune hypothyroid condition and that partner Trace mineral is selenium instead of waiting till you get one of these symptoms I suggest you just prevent an iodine deficiency by starting to consume Foods in your diet that have enough iodine and sea salt is not going to cut it here are the foods that are high in iodine SE or seaweed shellfish and fish from the ocean now you will get iodine from eggs and dairy but only if that chicken or cow has enough iodine in their diet last important point about this topic get a filter that filters out chlorine and fluide to make sure both of those do not interfere with your thyroid also be careful of the toothpaste that is filled with fluoride as well as getting fluid treatments at the dentist that can affect your thyroid as well because it blocks iodine thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video	Success
How Big Pharma Profits from Keeping You Sick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AdKqkNmJj4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	what if I were to tell you that we could literally end chronic disease in 10 weeks would you believe me today I bringing on Nina Ty Cults one of the most credible experts in this area she is a best-selling author she has her PhD in nutrition and has been deeply involved in researching the dietary guidelines for over two decades I think you at this interview so Nina RFK has this huge goal of getting rid of chronic disease and you personally studied this specific area of chronic disease and the dietary guidelines for roughly at least 20 years probably longer than that what based on the most credible research would you say is the solution to chronic disease I think there the strongest most rigorous evidence to support disease reversal is with a ketogenic or low carbohydrate diet and what we have is more than a hundred clinical trials now which there clinical trial research except for on the Mediterranean diet which does not have as good results there are more than a 100 clinical trials showing that with a ketogenic or low carbohydrate diet that not only can we reverse type two diabetes in merely 10 weeks but also hypertension the vast majority of cardiovascular risk factors non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 10 weeks I mean an average Doctor Who treating someone with type two diabetes how many weeks are they treating diabetes for the reversal rate where you reverse a type 2 diabetes diagnosis with standard of care that 0.1% oh my go clinical trials using a ketogenic diet often with support from a mobile app that reversal rate is more than 50% this is huge I mean this should be all over the place it should be in the news doctors should be using it but they not really using it are they I following this for the past 10 years and I have not seen a single mainstream news article on the ability to reverse a diagnosis of type two diabetes using diet natural means you see an article every week every every day on OIC or the gp1s right that tells you that the media is really informed by the pharmaceutical companies by which they people think type 2 diabetes is irreversible but that is absolutely positively not true you can do it there talk about credible we uh the type of studies that they and also the number of participants right in the length of time it some little observational study the largest trial ever on type two diabetes reversal had 300 patients in it the patients on average had been living with diabetes for 8.4 years and the majority of them were on insulin and even so they reversed more than half of their patients diabetes in 10 weeks also tell us about the the reduction of insulin their medication what in this trial nearly 100% of the patients reduced some or all of their medications within a year the patients come off so quickly off their medications that reasons that people are with diabetes are counseled to go on a ketogenic with medical supervision not because it dangerous not because it has bad side effects but because they need to come off their medication so quickly what is the general consensus of the medical profession diet you know ever since Robert Atkins came out with his books in the early 1970s there has been a real skepticism out there about the low carbohydrate ketogenic diet and back then it was warranted because were really no good rigorous studies on his approach even though he had a drawer full of medical files but now those Studies have really been done yet we still see the same bias uh I would say bias against this diet and that is for several reasons one is that you know the American Heart Association the American Diabetes Association they by insulin manufacturers and other drug companies so they have direct conflicts of interest doctors themselves also have these conflicts of interest all their careers they is the way to go so those diets are really almost diametrically opposed and it to change its mind the American Heart Association the American College of Cardiology have come after the ketogenic diet with virtually no evidence just sort of media campaigns saying keto is dangerous a ketol likee diet is dangerous based on in one case virtually just a spoken presentation with no data and not even a published abstract so I think it there going on against low car ketogenic I think you could be right it could be on to something there remember someone putting something out it was just ridiculous the definition of keto likee diet well there might be some similarities but it not does not resemble the ketogenic diet right I can like that keto likee diet that was the study that came out of um British Columbia by a researcher who simply gave a presentation on her findings that for which there was no abstract for which there was no published anything it it her study had not even been registered in any way and yet they interviewed her they press released her her presentation they didn out of their annual conference everything else was a legitimate published study why did they do that why why do they want to amplify her findings I mean it headline drives people away from choosing that option if the American College of Cardiology is coming out and saying this diet is dangerous people listen and I think that is the objective behind that or what specific foods does someone have to eat or what have to do with their foods to achieve the state of ketosis which is the fat burning you eating ideally natural sources of those Foods so that shellfish very small amounts of starchy vegetables and low sugar fruits it sustainable diet and this is a key point it are what are satiating versus carbohydrates actually trigger hunger they have done experiments why they try to force feed people to eat like a stack of pork chops and people just can I say you go try to go from one to the next and you fat you could actually easily get hungry real fast your fat stores are actually like granola bars they over your body and they when you don when glucose is absent your body can access those fat stores it sitting here and I haven hopefully I stores in my thighs the moment that glucose enters into to your bloodstream your body it teller window just slapping down you can no longer access your fat stores then you cannot access your own fat for energy the dietary guidelines which you studied extensively people are are influenced by that dietary guideline is it quite extensive as far as where it goes the dietary guidelines are really the most powerful lever in the country on what Americans eat for several reasons one is that by law all federal food programs are required to follow the guidelines so that includes the national school lunch program infant children feeding programs programs for the elderly the military which has an obesity problem equal to the general population is required to teach the guidelines second the guidelines are basically downloaded by health professionals as the gold standard so even if you don guidelines when you go to your doctor nurse nutritionist dietitian they are giving you the guidelines what is the problem with the dietary guidelines and is there a little bit of conflict of interest involved I did uh was an author on the first ever paper to systematically review all the conflicts of interest of the experts that are appointed to review the guidelines in the last committee we found that 95% of that 20 person committee had a tie to either food or Pharma half the committee had 30 such ties or more one person had aund 52 ties to food or Pharma so I mean there are clearly influences there that are you know direct conflicts with the idea that people need healthy food and there certain viewpoints out there that you know we need to get the chemicals out of the junk food and this and that but from your Viewpoint and your experience working with the the actual food itself can we actually correct the chronic disease if we food additive I think that could only be beneficial for us there should have such long lists of ingredients in our food products however food dyes taken out of Froot Loops is fr Loops that aren carry a huge load of starch with them right so that not going to reverse disease I don know of any clinical trial studies that show that removing these ingredients will reverse chronic disease where we have the evidence is with a low carbohydrate ketogenic diet that can reverse disease we have many clinical trials on that we must go forward as RFK J has said himself in an science-based way the best quality studies especially for population-wide guidelines that affect everybody so if in other words you Pop-Tarts and maybe organic Pop-Tarts right food coloring this is not going to correct my metabolic disease you know I looked at the the amount of sugar starch and seed oil it more in here people know about sugar but you also have the starch which is not necessarily listed on the label as starch it starch molecules are just sugar molecules holding hands and the moment you eat them they become sugar in your body even if that even if that sugar the moment that you eat it unfortunately there really are no good versus bad carbohydrates because they all become sugar in your body but I think the ultr processed food companies are completely on this they figure out the way to reduce their ingredient list and they see we solved the problem when in fact the real data shows that we have to Target this specific macronutrient which is carbohydrates which is driving these diseases right because you look at even potato chips right it has zero sugars oh yeah that sugar no sugar added that meaningless what is the single most important thing that we could possibly do to rid chronic disease if we can get good food advice about what constitutes a diet that can reverse disease out to the American public then we will be able to reverse chronic disease and we will be able to do it quickly I mean the study that you quoted is like 10 weeks that more than two months that such a short period of time it it in the largest study that has ever been done more than half the patients reverse their type two diabetes in just 10 weeks this is not about doing more research right I mean we keep doing research and research and research and people say yeah the evidence is not out yet but there topic we don doing it right we have credible data at least as a starting point I completely agree we have enough research we have multiple randomized control clinical trials showing that disease reversal is possible and there is not a need for more research at this point although more research is helpful and needed but we can absolutely start based on the research that we have here we have actual intervention trials on real humans that shows how the body actually responds far better source of data and we don of all the tests that a doctor can do yes we have blood glucose test right we have A1C is there any other test that would be important for a medical doctor to test uh as maybe as a some to catch as a preventative type test testing your fasting insulin will allow you to identify your steadily worsening metabolic Health decades literally decades earlier before you get a diagnosis of type two diabetes so it people even kids with fasting insulin levels to discover have they embarked already on this worsening metabolic Health journey I mean doctors should do that as a very Baseline test it tells you much more than your fasting glucose it tells you more than your lipids that measurement would just be a fantastic thing to do you have these intelligent people but they missing the obvious but I think it it taught you know because it know there therapy the medical curriculum has been largely informed by the thinking of pharmaceutical companies and so you know doctors are taught that basically you can try diet and lifestyle interventions but they largely don kind of fatigue about diet I actually um had one student tell me that they went up to their lecturer in medical school uh afterwards and said hey Doc do you know about the ketogenic diet and the professor said well I ketogenic diet myself but I allowed to teach it in the classroom interesting I can they experiences tell their patients to go on a diet the diet doesn as a doctor to conclude well this kind of intervention just doesn I whatever else I prescribe so that rational response to telling your patients about basically a failed diet this is just fascinating information and uh I am very adamant about and you are too about promoting this solution I like how did you simplify this and organize in such a way that just it just very interesting so I appreciate that I for those of you that have not checked that out definitely check it out because it reading as well thank you I mean we live in a time when there are just so few journalists investigating the politics the corruption in nutrition I wish there were more I have virtually no colleagues so every time I look into something and find just wild amounts of conflicts of interest and shoddy science and I wish I weren this so yes I mean I I would welcome any journalists out there who me I mean it investigate and for anyone who signs up for my substack there there about you know the bad science on meat and cancer and the conflicts of interest on that panel the conflicts of interest at our most esteemed universities like at Harvard and Stanford in their nutrition departments I mean it is it is stunning uh the Wess is is coming up and uh things are going to change and I think the future is bright in this area so thank you so much for coming on I appreciate that thank you for having me	Success
THIS Pill Causes Dementia!!!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	most doctors know the side effects from taking medication but what I don hardly any doctors really understand is the side effects from taking multiple drugs the interaction between certain drugs let common medications that can actually cause dementia or at least put you at a major risk for getting dementia from my viewpoint I would get really upset if I got a side effect especially dementia from another medication let common drugs that have a known side effect of dementia first category of drugs are those that block or inhibit acetal choline that these drugs include benagil which is antihistamine certain drugs for depression as well as drugs that treat an overactive bladder if someone these for a prolonged period of time the risk for dementia goes way up next one is something called benzo dipine this drug treats anxiety insomnia and seizures talking about vume and z X apparently this drug affects the central nervous system AKA your brain and it can greatly increase the risk of getting dementia then we have something called ppis proton pump inhibitors those medications treat indigestion heartburn like pyac and Nexium they can increase the risk of cognitive decline then the last one which is a big one is opioids like morphine or oxycodone anything that creates sedation on the brain like when you go in for surgery and they give you certain anesthetics that can greatly affect your cognitive function leading to dementia there effects from drug interactions and unfortunately as people get older and eventually end up in an assisted living home or nursing home boy they just start just giving medications routinely in fact let owns several assisted living homes and see what he has to say we have a whole lot of people that come with between 20 and 30 medications each go our our record is 5 we had a guy who had 54 medications what your program is you do this very Cutting Edge complex therapy called Introducing real food right I basically you just is that simple you give them real food because as you told me like a lot of these nursing facilities or or Assisted Living they processed food right very much so yes it to keep you know costs low or they the big facilities have contracts with large food distribution companies and sort of serve what they provide you have to work with the family of course and because they have to authorize it but you have a whole protocol and give me an example of what foods that you don them how long have you got um so anything pretty much if you think of the middle aisles of the grocery store that packaged food um we really try to avoid any sugars um I have a health coach that has taught my cooks and caregivers how to prepare the food and what foods to prepare um she ingredients that are sugar basically but they don different names for sugar she us how to read food labels we really try to get one ingredient Foods when you buy broccoli or you buy steak there ingredient on that list and that of how we do it anything with very multiple ingredients or something from a chemistry class we don simple now tell me are are any of the people coming to you uh kind of eventually getting off some of these meds oh tremendously we we argue with their doctors all the time we uh work off their meds um fre quently um our personal goal is to get them off we get a lot of diabetics so we we worked and we insulin that formin blood pressure medications statins um obviously we work with all our medical professionals and and get them to deprescribe it we have to by the Department of Health have an an order to stop the medications but we discussions of what we can do the guy with 54 medications he own in an apartment by himself now and he you an example now you have people that come to you that were actually in hospice oh frequently yes they they discharge from a hospital or Rehab on hospice and come to us and we work very hard to get them to no longer qualify for hospice we call it graduating from hospice what type of results are you seeing in general physically physically we sorts of um a lot of the dementia people we work with an outside company to do a whole bunch of lab testing um but we see hormone levels go up we see um inflammation go way down vitamin D levels all kinds of vitamin levels go up um plus you see it physically you know that we we have people come bedbound and uh they go into Wheelchairs and the wheelchairs go to Walkers and the Walkers go to walking so um you know then they can spend more time with their family we had a we had a 98-year-old gentleman go on a cruise with his family for a week um you know something he couldn first came to us and we let them borrow a caregiver she got a free cruise out of it and um you know he had the time of his life came back passed away six months later but you know was very happy those last six months amazing I you one thing if I know anyone um that is in that situation where they need to go somewhere I so I will uh think you going to put your link down below so more people can know about it but it incredible I wish more organizations did what you to spread the word it when dealing with someone on a lot of medications to know what is causing what the other complexity on top of that is you have multiple doctors involved they each have their own viewpoint they each focusing in a different part of the body there drug reactions this is the unexpected side effect directly caused from drugs 90% of these are Under reported adverse drug reactions are responsible for 10% of all hospital visits it fourth leading cause of death I wanted to bring on a board certified endocrinologist and ask her some questions about this topic we know drugs have side effects but have we studied the interaction between drugs patients don package inserts that are in fine print most of us it those little tiny papers and you know where I practice in India a lot of medications just come in aluminum blister packs without any insert so the patient may not really have a list of side effects to read through drug interactions is written in tiny print busy doctors are prescribing and what I do is I use a free free software there version of it it O C A tes and I look for drug interactions there just to keep on top of it because there medications coming out even when I was in practice I would have patients come in they even more medications are you seeing some of that as well like just the number of prescriptions are just just really going high really long and especially in the space of where where you know you and I see a lot of you know things is chronic conditions where it not a fever or a back sprain and you done with your medications in four to seven days or a course of antibiotics it prolonged like blood pressure or diabetes and these pills end up not really being looked at as when do we get you off of it and that focus on a lot is to keep looking at the medication list to cut back whenever we can and a lot of times the patient is going to different Specialists and unfortunately the busy specialist might be looking at the one body part that they they interactions of what I with what maybe the other specialist is prescribing so even though I endocrinologist and I still count as a specialist or a top you know super specialized I end up zooming out and doing what a primary care doctor often does is let and we two things that cause constipation two things that cause drowsiness there many interactions even with my mother-in-law she started noticing signs of Alzheimer older and so um I just looked at her medications is because she was on quite a few and I started talking to the doctor I this causes dementia right as a side effect so do we really need it I think it was a bladder medication because that effect of dementia so got her off that she started doing better but I mean I you see that all the time all the time and sometimes you uh a pain medication and sometimes rebound pain comes in or an anti-depressant and temporarily some people have increased you know negative thoughts what I really like about you is you um you include the diet as part of the equation when you evaluate someone like you joke recently where a pet owner was joking that you know when you go to the vet with your pet the first thing the vet asks you is what are you feeding them wow wow that would be a smart thing to ask H but why don ask that that the human pet owners right and so uh it for the pet I I can else that contributes to either more health or more disease than what we put in our bodies 100% and you know I talk about this step by step when I when I work with people over 3 months or 6 months is the four wheels of the lifestyle car and you know the first wheel is always nutrition is what are we putting in the body you putting a medication in the body so I like we want to reduce the medication what else is going into your mouth or into your body every day is hood and then we go into sleep then we go into Stress Management exercise and after that maybe fasting but the first wheel is always nutrition I also want to talk about some really common symptoms that are directly caused by so many medications let example did you realize that the side effect constipation can come from over 150 different medications the problem with chronic constipation is it can lead to something called megacolon where your colon is just enlarged and you can develop infections it can burst that why we have laxatives right the doctor is going to probably give someone a laxative to try to stimulate the release of this waste the problem with laxatives is they destroy the lining of the colon and also it your body depends on them with the diabetes medication what that does is it gets the sugar out of the blood to help normalize the blood sugar but the question is what does it do with that Sugar it kidneys pushing it out through the urine of course when someone has this symptom they then put on medications that cause urinary retention then they get a risk for urinary tract infection dizziness is another really common side effect of quite a few medications one big problem especially with the elderly is that dizziness is the number one cause of why someone when they dizziness comes from like taking high blood pressure medication anti-depressants and even sleeping pills there paradoxical drug side effects you taking a medication for a certain effect but you end up getting that same effect this happens quite frequently too you taking an anti-depressant but it actually caus you to become more depressive or you take an ant acid and then you end up getting heartburn one of the biggest reasons why people develop chronic disease I personally think it comes from what the patient eats I primarily talking about processed foods junk food is at the top of the list as far as the reason why people go to the doctor for their chronic disease a really big part of big pharma medications are really about treating the side effect from this processed food because the doctor does not really evaluate what the person the doctor that connection between junk food and chronic disease that is literally holding this whole thing together and it keeps allowing the drugs to be prescribed and then new medications added to treat the side effect from this other drug what is the one thing that can literally turn this whole thing around it thing thing where we out the junk food for real food and if you want more information about what real food is you should check out this video right here	Success
DON'T GET SURGERY Unless You Do This First	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you do not want to get a surgery unless you do this one thing first and this is really really important there risks when you go into a surgery one is dying this video is not just for patients it can look at the research and this simple thing which basically costs pennies can create a massive Improvement in your outcomes of the surgery you get getting your vitamin D tested and making sure you have sufficient vitamin D before surgery all surgeries what is so special about vitamin D in relationship to a surgery doing the surgery itself lowers your vitamin D because there involved if you blood pressure can go up vitamin D is one of the best remedies for high blood pressure because vitamin D increases something called nitric oxide which helps vasod dilation of the arteries your immune system depends on enough vitamin D to prevent infections like sepsis inflammation vitamin D is really important to reduce cardiovascular complications after a surgery and one stud before the operation there was an average of 42.7 and take a while guess what the average vitamin D was after the surgery 28 in your mind you might think I might need to take 2,000 I use no people are taking like a 100,000 or even 300,000 or more before a surgery then you also have vitamin D affecting your muscles if you don muscles the muscles can become weak and your risk of fall falling down uh greatly goes up if you is a problem because you might end up fracturing yourself I mean even if you do a search on Google Scholar and I found six studies involving vitamin D and surgery for osteoporosis another 10 studies on bone in general and vitamin D in relationship to Healing after surgery if someone has low vitamin D their postoperative inflammatory indicators actually increase by 200% and the wound that they just created takes longer to heal I bit about a new called natural B12 methyl camine with the B complex blend what is the B complex vitamins actually come from food which is very different from most B vitamins which come from petroleum this B12 is not synthetic it the natural version called methyl camine if you want a really high quality B12 you might want to try this take One A Day I take this in the morning but some people find it more convenient to take it with a meal this one bottle will last you 2 months 6 days vitamin D uh also controls this antimicrobial peptide which is a compound to help your immune system kill microbes vitamin D has the potential to increase those antimicrobial peptides by 4,000% keeping the complication of an infection way down while surgical complications are cut in half with sufficient vitamin D in one state I found as much as half of atrial fibrillation was reduced with enough vitamin D and that study it actually blew my mind they were using 600,000 iuse of vitamin D3 we definitely want to make sure we have enough vitamin D if you surgery if you taken out surgery to remove cancer if someone is low in vitamin D the postsurgical cognitive side effects or dysfunction eight times more likely to have cognitive dysfunction after a surgery if you don D having enough vitamin D can decrease your risk of having some type of rejection when you transplant in one study I found um there was fewer complications especially in the area of ventilators when 120,000 IUS of vitamin D was used when you think about vitamin D think of fewer days in the hospital after the surgery faster healing rates there was a study involving children in intensive care they loaded up these children 10,000 IUS per kilogram at first I thought it was a typo it should have been a thousand IUS but it was actually 10,000 I used some people are going to ask well what about the toxic effects we about using these high doses you know 3 days before a surgery we about using the high doses a long term you go in there but you saturating the body with enough to make sure that there insufficient now there interesting data about your adrenal glands okay because going through a surgery puts a lot of stress on your adrenals this is why they monitor your heart because sometimes your adrenals might overcompensate with adrenaline and you can end up with high blood pressure so there surgery connection giving you a risk of adrenal insufficiency they tested a cortisol Spike after a surgery it can increase by 4X if you vitamin D which can worsen your ability to heal your regulation of inflammation your adrenals do not want to go through a surgery with low vitamin D vitamin D influences over 2,000 genes but there 200 of those genes relate to your adrenals this video is not just to remind you to get your vitamin D tested before surgery but to make sure you have sufficient amounts and I about just a little bit I about a lot before you go into surgery you want to take this additional vitamin D 3 days before a surgery so it has time to really penetrate and get into your cells and act as a protective mechanism against the complications of surgery thanks for watching spread this video to your friends and family so they can have this knowledge of doing something extremely simple and inexpensive to create a lot of good or protect you against a lot of bad things that can happen as you go through a surgery	Success
The 1 Vitamin That REVERSES Nerve Damage (And Nobody Talks About It)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	the one vitamin that reverses nerve damage the reason I want to talk about this one vitamin is because it most common deficiency behind most nerve problems let I the potential to go into the nerves on the face and create conditions like Bell nerve bundle called the ganglia it like a mini brain within the nerves that have this bundle of nerve cells what unique about it is the viruses go into those areas those little bundles to evade the immune system and kind of fly underneath the radar then what the viruses do is they can turn off something called autophagy autophagy is a condition where you damaged proteins but you recycling pathogens bacteria yeast fungus molds and viruses and because they hide with our immune system and they just kind of go to sleep and our immune system doesn because they anything but just waiting for your stress to go up because when you have stress you have cortisol cortisol is an immune suppressant one of the most severe stresses that someone can go through is an emotional stress and this is why a lot of these dormant viruses come out of remission after a stress event loss of a loved one is a huge one loss of money and I of times in practice um with someone with a herpes virus or even shingles I before this and sure enough it was a stress event and they can come out and create other problems too like fibromyalgia also problems on your face as well there those viruses they need the amino acid called Arginine to exist and just so happens that Arginine competes with another amino acid called lysine if you have enough lysine you can block Arginine and stop the reproduction of this virus you have to take a lot of Lysine to kind of compete and block Arginine you want to take 1,000 Mig to 3,000 Mig every single day for a period of time to put that virus back and remission as well as do whatever you can do to reduce stress let nerve problem stica that usually comes from a disc issue a lot of people with dis problems are deficient in Copper if you have sodaka you may want to try either taking a supplement with copper or just putting copper cream topically around that area in your back where it originates to reduce the discomfort next condition is carpal tunnel syndrome that B6 deficiency the primary nerve that supports myin is B12 and that would be another type of nerve problem because if you electric shock like Sensations in your nervous system very very painful or even numbness and that involved with the milein sheath around the nerve that protects the nerve that insulates the nerve that allows the signals to transmit then we get to Ms okay this is an autoimmune disease this can definitely affect your nerves your brain vitamin D3 is essential in reducing inflammation within the nerve cells and also your brain cells you need to take large amounts of vitamin D3 50 60 70 80,000 I use a vitamin D3 to put that condition into remission there of research on this using something called the coimbra protocol which I will put a link down below more information about that now let common nerve problem that exists and that is something relating to either pre-diabetes or diabetes a lot of people with diabetes end up with nerve problems in their feet they get numbness in the toes first and then it kind of starts traveling in the foot the bottom of the foot becomes painful the sugar in the blood is creating such a demand for this one vitamin and that vitamin is called vitamin B1 thymine I would take it in the form of benine because that tends to penetrate the myelin and get right into the nerve and very quickly reverse nerve damage that more carbohydrates or sugar someone consumes the greater the need for B1 if you diabetic you have a lot of sugar going through the bloodstream that means you compensate but of course if you just come off the sugar that might be a better solution but benot toine this is a fat salable version of B1 is the best antidote for peripheral neuropathy because B1 is necessary for the metabolism of carbohydrates and just as a very important side note in order for B1 to work there you need and that wanted to create this video kind of short to the point and cover the most common issues uh relating to nerves and what nutrients you should focus on to hopefully reduce those problems	Success
The Corrupt Food Industry Hiding In Your Child's School Lunch	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52QX97fpn_0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	[Music] why are we feeding our kids crap this has got to stop up to 70% of your children foods these refined sugars starches and Seed oils are literally destroying your child McNugget classified as a nutrient-dense food or a french fried classified as a vegetable we have a problem after many months of searching I stumbled on a school that is doing it right it amazing organization called School of lunch where a small group of volunteers developed an incredible training program that is literally going to spread around the United States and around the world today we founder Hillary Boon which they call the lunch lady tell me briefly your story how you gotten into the position that you through my own health journey and my family into becoming a lunch lady never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that I there but here we are you know from in my own infertility to having five kids and with various issues from eczema to epilepsy and speech delays whatnot and then a husband with cancer a father with Alzheimer cancer Journey brought us from Massachusetts to California where we landed in this small little mountain town in Los Angeles and the the school there aligned completely with um the My Philosophy around food and how I had healed my family and I was all in and then as the school grew they outsourced the food and when I that stepped in and said this is not aligned with my beliefs and how nature intended for us to to eat and so I stepped in as this s coordinator and the consultant to the lunch lady and then halfway through the school year I was given the keys to the kitchen and um it was almost like the universe was like here you go girl like take the keys and show what the door and um decided to just show what decade in I for um some type of program out there someone that school system and I couldn anything and then I stumbled on your site I amazing so I pictures of the types of meals that you looks like you know you traditional food I know it completely low car but you the grains soaking the seeds getting rid of certain things that can interfere with digestion uh sauerkraut Oregan Meats grass-fed meat from local farms incredible I mean if I would have lived on this food growing up things would have been a lot better believe me yeah absolutely I mean it really does come down to to the quality and also the that that connection to our food and our local food system we 85% of our foods from our local food system and when I had my you know switch flipped when I was fat free and fell for all that propaganda when I saw how traditionally you know across the globe cultures were thriving free of disease and studying their diets much like the work of Dr Weston a price my eyes were opened and I was just like wow this this totally makes sense and I my whole life and through our journey on the gaps diet as a family and I wrote a cookbook of the heal your gut cookbook I understood the gut brain and the gut Body Connection and how we balance it we have their stomachs for six hours a day that the year so we have a massive opportunity to make a difference in the trajectory of their health you know imagine a 5-year-old being fed this way all the way up until they graduate what type of um effects is it creating either in a child their mood the very first year we started we did a little video documentary on it and unprompted this little sixth grade kid said I used to feel like this up and down all day long and now I just feel like this and I was like my jaw Dr I was just like that that mean these kids they they know what it feels like to feel terrible but they that of a sudden they feel good and are properly absorbed and digested they just feel even and steady so we see kids engaged and happy and joyful and teachers are also participating so they kids as mentors eating the same foods and then they classroom together satiated and and um and satisfied you know I think that the biggest thing is like especially being fat free forever I was like never satisfied and when you have you know proper amounts of protein and fats like good saturated fats you satisfied I reflect back on my kids so they so that was 30 years ago so I remember you know trying to force my daughter in the car she didn but this whole thing was like a blood sugar issue that nothing about nutrition I wish I can go back in time because if I would have known what I know now it would have been a game Cher with their their mood their ability to remember and learn these little kids are you know having their light bulbs turned on and you know their cells are all like woo you know happy and and they back and saying like you know the school food mom can you make food like Miss Hillary or can you make sour croud and the parents are Awakening right and so it bring the parents and for parents at lunch and introduce them to what we doing and that because parents just don schools don dedicated you know Army of chefs who are going to show up every day and I think it the world and that to spark within like people who are graduating from culinary school or um you know register dietitians nutritionists who are like wanting to make a change like what better place to be able to make a a lasting change than to dive into a school system and get these kids really young but what you doing you took it one step further you developed a training program to teach other schools other Chefs of how to do this right you know as we went along and I saw the changes in the teachers and the parents and the kids and everybody wanting more information I was just like everyone needs to know this it only school systems but it and churches and community centers like just do whatever you can do to get this message wherever your passion lies but obviously school lunches right now is just so hot and so huge and the opportunity is like right now my question is why isn school system because we to get this dietary food guideline thing change for many many years and it going to take some work to do that but you part you reason why it you have a very small group of people volunteers including yourself trying to do this on a shoestring budget which is like no budget and I one don you just you you resources to be able to keep up because I know the demand is really high people want to learn this but it you only have a few people I money driven person and I can pite you in the butt I guess but it been about passion and vision for me and seeing it every day and being in the work with my own kids and doing this for my kids and for the community and um but we apparent that the world needs us you know this vision and this Mission can just stay on this little mountain top into P California it needs to be you know it needs to go it needs to go I you know I I can and I can only do so much right we are just like a skeleton crew and so we need the support to you know to get this message out to the masses and to show people that other way because once they see it I know people will gravitate towards it because it just makes sense it to eat as humans right it we until this industrialization and Ultra processed foods came in this is the way we lived and thrived free of disease and this is what everybody ultimately wants for their children right so we need to make videos we need to make toolkits because what happens is people get trained but then they in the system as the lone soldier right so they need support and they need that those continued resources to keep them going and then we need this the kids for the schools the school you know the superintendent an enlightened superintendent can do a lot of things but most of them don they need to see what need to know the why and they need to hear it from people that have done it and that it is possible because there so many barriers to entry for them there I million schools but I can train a million people because every school has their own issues so you want the people that are passionate about that school and are going to dive in and pull apart what needs to change to make that program successful so we really just need we need the support you know I humbly asking because I just believe so whole edly that we know Humanity where our children are so sick that it like we can going and we have this traction so it like let want to actually help you as well I want to I know you have a GoFundMe account we I followers are going to help you in fact I something anything to help uh support what you guys are doing because you need a lot of res resources you need staff you need uh promotional M materials you need to have more people so you can actually have an army of trainers so we can actually make a dent those of you that are watching now if you can flow something to this anything we appreciate it because uh I going to help but we need a lot of people to help out to give you guys support because what you strictly on purpose and uh I want to get behind that so I mean this is just amazing well thank you so much I mean it social media and that my message can go instantly you know that blessing of of technology and social media is that you know once that momentum gets going um a spark can you know ignite so many people and I just believe people are craving this information and you don sick the body will heal you know this isn about our children we want these kids to be giving birth to a healthy next generation of kids and to understand that they have agency over that we have all this money we have the worst outcomes and we have the doctor right in the center okay and they diagnosing but they food as part of their evaluation they just omitting that piece of data right and then we have the junk food industry that there over 50% of adults over 60% of children and teenagers are consuming alter processed food and they problems health problems that are treed by big Pharma so this whole system revolves around this one single Omission the omission of actual real food like right now there is medicine I don of that before food is medicine it sounds really great right food is medicine doesn until you dig deep into what they recommending and so I looked at their food is medicine and they certain proteins they recommend a lot of starches they you know mac and cheese Cheerios cereal we the existing dietary guidelines so again this is not going to work I think we need to give kids credit to right they the information and you give them that you know that feeling of what it feels like to feel good they they want that they want to feel good right I mean we had a kid who came in in fourth grade failure to thrive his mom was like all distraught and she had actually had my cookbook but didn lunch lady at her kids school was like so you know we we talked and I supported the kid and looked after him and lots of bone broths and just really things that were easy on his gut and you know now he grade um in high school and he thriving and it didn long it was just you know and I would Source foods for her and get her organ meats and different you know different cuts of meat so that she can make meat stocks and stuff so that communication and that connection with the mom and the care that went into this child just quickly turned him around and now he knows those diagnoses that kids have don so powerful when you give the kids and the parents the tools to fuel the body correctly you can seconds with a kid and shove him through the line and put Foods you know fresh fruits and vegetables on there and think this is going to change the whole trajectory of their health I just don believe that I think you were really needing to connect I for 30 years and so the first question I ask every single person coming in kids and adults is um you come in with a problem what are you eating what are you eating it don connection between what you and uh these diagnosis as add or attention deficit disord like all these different mental disorders they don connect them with Foods right they get a label even kids are becoming more depressed nowadays it shouldn that can lead to drugs and addictions and you know taking more medications and so uh as we get older you can see the end result of this a person in a nursing home on 48 different medications that where we I know it energy right to be able to do all what you thing you have to go find the food you to learn about it you have to cook it prepare it then you people how to do it so I mean I I like blown away yeah it think the other thing that we that is is a disservice to our children is that these diagnoses are you know kind of just their a lot in life and there you you know my child with eczema I was like oh I allergies that just run hand in hand he might outgrow it he might not I put him on raw milk and codiv oil and he completely healed you know and I was just like what food just healed my child like you know right so it understanding the the power of food and the power in the agency that we have and so um getting to that root cause is so important and much of that does lie with what we spotted this as something that super important you have it right because I a lot of different programs like I didn close to what you guys do and then then to find out you have a training program I please donate if you can anything that would be great and then um what we is we success and the effects of um our donations and how they help you guys expand because um we need this to expand all over the world because if we we not I Food Pyramid we got to do something right now any support we truly appreciate it the training acmy are lifechanging I know 100% money back guarantee if your life hasn you just get it so I get this message out to your followers and thank you so much for sharing our message and any support is just greatly appreciated I really believe like you said now is the time and we can it need us awesome thank you very much	Success
Why Men Today Have HALF the Testosterone of Their Grandfathers	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqwvm5RsHRM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	there are six main signs that you have low testosterone men today have over 50% less testosterone than they had several decades ago and the question is why what the heck is going on it low testosterone it it into the causes of this and causes that you probably have never heard before then I let signs number one is breast tissue man boobs what the heck is going on with extra breast tissue in men well it increase in estrogen as you are decreasing your testosterone it basically a feminization of a man because the ratios of estrogen are just way too much number two shrinking testicles another name for this is hypogonadism the testicles are getting smaller and smaller and of course the testosterone is also getting lower shrinking muscles as well testosterone is intimately involved with making muscle and if you don going to be very difficult to develop muscle number three reduced semen production now semen is not sperm seen is an extra fluid that helps to deliver sperm number four decreased body hair specifically the beard the chest the legs and even on top of your head the skin becomes very shiny and soft without hair number five andropause that situation where a man is getting hot flashes or night sweats when I was in practice I would have men come in with that symptom and one time I even had a doctor who specializes in menopause come in with his main symptom being hot flashes and he didn medication that he gives women which is hormone replacement therapy unfortunately a lot of men go for Viagra the problem is there complications side effects like heart attacks and even a side effect of prolonged erection number six is is excess belly fat because you have insulin resistance testosterone does have an influence over insulin it worsens insulin resistance which means your body has to compensate by increasing more insulin the fat making hormone and so now you fat than you should and this ends up as excess belly fat this is probably why a lot of young males when they or 20 do not have belly fat because they testosterone and other hormones that are related to keeping your stomach flat okay so those are all the signs of low testosterone now let interesting causes and I think a lot of people know those causes and they probably also know that junk food and too much sugar will lower estrogen and they probably also know that carbohydrates and sugar also decrease testosterone so I those I want to cover some other things that I need to put on your radar so you really understand the real big cause of lowered testosterone presently is endocrine disruptors what disruptor anything in the environment chemical wise that can mimic estrogen pesticides insecticides herbicides fungicides you also have Plastics microplastics accumulate in your body one of the biggest primary sources of plastic that we in our water supply I don you they accumulate in your body and they just don thousand years for these chemicals to break down and you can test is in your water supply and if you actually have City Water you have them in your water another big cause of lowered testosterone a lack of sleep if you getting under 7 hours of sleep I guarantee your testosterone is probably pretty low because when you don enough your cortisol goes up and cortisol which is a stress hormone just kills testosterone the next point I want to bring up is just stress in general if you to have low testosterone another hidden source of decreased testosterone is WiFi and electromagnetic fields from things like this especially if you these in your pocket keep this away from your body put on speaker phone but don keep it close anywhere in your pockets or even next touching your head next cause is phytoestrogens soy products soy milk soy protein iets which is probably one of the most common protein in protein powders as well as those protein bars that would be also in the vegetarian Meats in practice I met a guy who was consuming about a gallon of soy milk a day he started developing breast tissue and get this with lactation I am not kidding the next cause of low tea is low zinc zinc is so important for testosterone in order for you to make this steroid hormone testosterone it the conversion and what is it converting it converting cholesterol to testosterone with the help of zinc cholesterol is also needed as a raw material so if you cholesterol blocking drug AKA statins that could be the reason why you have low testosterone and then we get to the last cause of low tea too much iron what our body has no mechanism of getting rid of iron and so what happens is this iron accumulates in your organs and it starts to rust out the organs if you you don dysfunctional iron not only do you not have enough iron to feed the red blood cells that also have an excess of iron inside the cells because it you involved in certain enzymes to help protect the cells from excess iron a deficiency of copper is really at the bottom of this problem with excess iron now I the last one is the most important one number one zinc number one most important Trace mineral to increasing testosterone now the rdas for zinc are between 8 and 11 milligrams that is just not enough you up to maybe 50 milligrams every single day the problem is if you taking zinc by itself without being in a base of trace minerals you end up over time creating a copper deficiency and then your iron go up and that can affect your testosterone you can get a lot of zinc in red meat oysters liver and shellfish next nutrient that you need is more magnesium magnesium is also another helper mineral to help you convert cholesterol into the steroid testosterone and a lot of people take the wrong magnesium you want to take the Magnesium glycinate minimum 400 milligrams per day but probably a little bit more maybe 600 or even 800 milligrams per day and then we get vitamin D vitamin D directly helps you increase testosterone the big point about vitamin D is most people are taking way too little vitamin D you going to need as a maintenance dosage at least 10,000 IUS of vitamin D every single day to help you increase testosterone and to help you fix insulin resistance fix certain things in your liver vitamin D is going to be very very important next thing exercise is going to be vitally important you find if you do heavyweight training or resistance exercise training or even high-intensity interval training paralleled with enough rest you to find that testosterone next thing get a water filter that helps you filter out forever chemicals there about I will put those links down below now the last most important solution and you rudai El rudai is a special microbe that population 96% of the population doesn have it anymore because of past antibiotics this El Rudi can be cultured and made into kind of like a yogurt type mixture which is in very very high amounts per half of a cup it billion and you would consume this every single day there on rats they fed these rats El rudai in their water and the group that got El rudai had significant increase in the growth of their testicles even though they were older mice they have not done this study in humans but I talking to a lot of people that are taking this microb and they a great increased spike in testosterone because if you increase the size of the testicle you will increase testosterone but not only that it increases something called oxytocin probably the most powerful hormone to counter cortisol you you more erections during the night which is an indication of higher testosterone and so it does all of this plus there reports that increasing stem cells for muscle tissue especially as you age and I think the next most important video for you to watch is the one I did on iron so I put that up right here check it out	Success
The #1 Way to UNCLOG Your Colon Fast	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I want to talk about how your food actually turns into poop when you eating food you chew your food you starting to break your food down all the stuff that you information through your taste buds down lower into the digestive tract and then you also have the stomach that has to get ready to break down the protein let of the stomach first this valve is really important to keep the food in the stomach and from backing up into the esophagus because if that food backs up you have something called acid reflux or heartburn the real problem is the acid that you feel is just in the wrong location it little bit higher when it should be in the stomach the big mistake that people make is they start taking an acids not realizing that they neutralize acids in the stomach and the more you dilute these stomach acids the less that valve closes tightly instead if you have any of these acid regurgitation problems you should be taking more acid it sounds counterintuitive but it does work you can do aloid of vinegar diluted because you don because that esophagus but also uh you can take a really good remedy called Bane chloride and I have done videos on this but you probably take three or four or five right before a meal and you actually taking hydrochloric acid you taking something that turns into hydrochloric acid and to really understand that a little bit deeper the stomach acid should be between one and three that is like battery acid it super acidic as we age the acid dilutes and gets weaker by the time you your stomach acid is 50% of what it was when you were 20 if that pH is not super acid then we don minerals as well as we should in that situation we have too much bacteria in the small intestine 90% of all the digestion occurs in the small intestine and this is where you can also get leaky gut and leaky gut can occur if you eat a lot of things that are damaging especially in the areas of grains gluten can really create problems with that junk food refined sugar seed oils all of these things can actually create leaky gut and then we have enzymes within the small intestine that are helping you digest right at the point where the stomach releases its juices into the small intestine pancreas also has to release something to neutralize all that stomach acid or else it a hole in your small intestine how do you know that you don in your stomach indigestion so you eat food and it not digesting it telling your pancreas to get ready start to produce enzymes you have to then associate that with what enzymes going to be released because you have enzymes for protein carbs fats information is sent down to the liver and the gallbladder to prepare to digest because we have the BOS salts that are involved with that one tip on digestion is the worse off your digestion is the less food you should be eating but then we also have bile bile is not made by your gallbladder the bile is made by your liver and so the liver makes the bile it goes down a little tube and then it goes goes right into the gallbladder and it just gets concentrated to help you break down fats here we have the fat okay and here we have bile it we shake it around a little bit it helps you break down fat so you can extract the fat nutrients bio salts also kill off pathogens bad bacteria in the small intestine your microbes actually make bile salts as well when you become deficient in bile you start getting bloating burping belching your vision becomes a problem and something else happens too gall stones if you more cholesterol bile salts will help kind of get rid of that the specific one I would recommend is called tudka it very specialized type of Bio salt that you take on an empty stomach what these bio supplements do is they start to unclog the dam and just allow it to drain properly it gives you a lot of relief let me just move right down to the large intestine this is where something gets digested you have trillions and trillions of microbes in your large intestine that are helping you break down this fiber through an interesting process of fermentation feeding the microbes fiber and then that fatty acid which then feed the colon cells and these trillions of microbes do so many wonderful things for you they give you 80% of your immune system they help you make neurotransmitters like serotonin dopamine whatever is going on in your microbes down here is going to go on up here when you eat food it has to go through this entire assembly line of things that happen to the point where word ends up as poop poop is like mostly water the reason why it because of the pigment in the red blood cells that ends up in your stool and the smell of your poop it from bacteria and so it has a certain smell to it but it can smell even worse at certain times depending what happening in your digestion and or a lack thereof when you look at your poop you can get a lot of Clues on what going on I general things constipation diarrhea and that relates to missing microbes when you get an antibiotic people might tell you that those microbes will come back eventually that just think about how many antibiotics we take then there that acts like an antibiotic Roundup Ready Roundup Ready has a chemical in it called glyphosate glyphosate is an herbicide but they also have a patent on it acting as an antibiotic because it kills off your microbes even things that are non-GMO like wheat are loaded with glyphosate three times more than genetically modified foods like soybeans and corn and things like that one safe way to avoid glyphosate is just to avoid anything connected with grains and start eating more organic foods because the glyphosate can really mess with your microbes so eating fermented foods like sauerkraut kimchi is really important but also raw milk cheese is a really good one I also did a video on how to make your own probiotic uh from a microb called L ruteri that increases something called oxytocin it makes you more social it helps reduce stress it helps your sleep another really important tip is to do intermittent fasting because if you cramming all this food constantly the poor digestive system never has a chance to clean out another thing that I think a lot of people are doing incorrectly is drinking these uh smoothies with kale and banana and pineapple and you just start drinking those in the morning well again if you have leaky gut or inflammation you more bloating inflammation because you of course I used to recommend it and for some people they would thrive on it because they they needed that but it not a good overall recommendation for everyone 90% of chronic disease is coming from your food and most medications are treating the side effects of bad food thank you so much for watching and I will see you in the next video	Success
American Heart Association Opposed Banning Junk Food	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	the American Heart Association the organization that is supposed to prevent heart disease the number one killer worldwide and they showed up at a committee in Texas where they to pass a bill this bill would restrict people from using food stamps for things like sugary drinks candy and other unhealthy foods for the American Heart Association to be against this bill that might be the surprise of the session and out of all the groups that would oppose that bill would shock me the American Heart association governmental relationships who came in and opposed it I certainly understand why that might be surprising now I think most people know uh that the American Heart Association gets a lot of funding from the junk food industry but from a Public Relation standpoint you don want the American Heart Association opposing something like that well they did they were embarrassed the Heart Association is concerned about potential impacts of this bill on participation and population health I just was astonished uh that the American Heart Association uh was against our snap Reform Bill that would just say you can drinks you can that and and pushing people more to protein density rich foods they now say that they bill I certainly understand why that might be surprising did you realize that of all the foods soda is the single most frequent item bought under the snap program there soda industry because the subsidies dollars from taxpayers pay for the snap program in the amount of $1 billion not million dollar $10 billion a year for that soda which then lead to obesity type 2 diabetes then feeds big Pharma because they effects from the junk food industry and on top of that you have the American Heart Association that funding of this thing the soda lobbyists are just going haywire their latest uh meme or modotto or campaign was saying that this is an issue of Liberty right freedom to choose what you want to eat the American Heart Association has so many conflicts of interest and what do I mean conflicts of interest I mean money from actual industry big Pharma big food they have a whole section of the American Heart Association called the industry nutrition Forum where they have Pepsi General meals etc etc and of course on various cereals they have this little American Heart Association certified okay because they have the health grains of this whole grains you can pay to get this certification of course they have the Frosted version right here which also says can help you low the cholesterol but I don little seal right here even though both of these have virtually the same amount of carbohydrates both of these have whole grain oats corn starch sugar corn syrup and of course the soda industry is also hitting social media big time they lot of money to help them object to this bill in fact certain influencers were paid over $1,000 a post for objecting to this the other campaigns that they doing is um they insecurity we need to provide cheap food the entire uh idea of subsidy came after the Depression when the farmers needed help and this has evolved into a very corrupt operation where now we the junk food industry richer by paying for the raw material did you realize that one metric ton of that dent corn with the subsidies is $195 do you many boxes of corn flakes you can make with one metric ton of Dent corn basically we food industry to make this junk food then we SNAP program food stamps to make it very easy for people to consume this food now realize we already paid for a lot of the raw material for these junk foods to be made now we as taxpayers pay a second time for certain people that have food stamps to consume that junk food which we know 90% of chronic disease comes from junk food and the majority of big Pharma treats the side effect from junk food so as you can see the system is not broken it not working for you do the people that subsidize the snap program benefit no who benefits big food and big Pharma Here think they should continue the snap program for nutrient-dense foods not alra processed foods because that would not not only reduce chronic disease it would also save a tremendous amount of money with all the prescription medication we right now where the junk food industry is trying everything it can to maintain these profits because there tremendous amount of money at stake just the soda industry subsidies alone $10 billion a lot of the sweetener in the soda is high fructose corn syrup it goes to the liver it creates the fatty liver creates high blood pressure it creates diabetes it inflames the inside of the arteries it starts heart disease but it the organizations the American Heart Association was the one that stood up and opposed this bill you have to realize that the junk food industry never is the one that they use other organizations or front groups to do that type of work anyway I am just really curious what you think about this topic please let me know in the comments down below	Success

7 Silent Signs of Pancreatic Cancer	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	Let of pancreatic cancer that you never want to ignore. The reason I want to focus today on pancreatic cancer is because it cancer. The unique thing about pancreatic cancer is that a lot of times you don very far into its progression. This is why they call it the silent killer because by the time you know you have it, a lot of times it more you can identify these early triggers, the greater the prognosis is going to be. I into these early signs, and then I going to explain some very unique things about pancreatic cancer that you need to know. First one is sudden unexpected weight loss. You weight, but all of a sudden, you losing weight. Because pancreatic cancer starts in the pancreas, which is involved in digestion and blood sugars. If there it your appetite, and you could lose a lot of weight. Number two, abdominal pain. The pain is more of a dull, persistent pain that sometimes can radiate to the left shoulder. There can even be radiating pain from your belly button back into the spine because of the tumor on the pancreas could put pressure on various nerves. You feel worse if you eat because you going to have less space in there for things to move around and more food is going to put pressure on the tumor and put pressure on that nerve. Number three is jaundice. So the whites of the eyes become yellow. Your urine becomes like a darker rusty color. We problem with bile backing up into the blood causing jaundice. And on top of that, you bile. So you digest fat. We have this bile duct that duct at a certain point. And if there sludge in that area, it can back up and cause problems not just in your gallbladder, you can have a problem in the pancreas. Just so you know, there a really great remedy for that. I recommend it. is called Toddka. It very specific type of bile salt that you can get and you take two an empty stomach twice a day and it just opens up those ducts. It problems with bile sludge and bloating in this area. Number four, chronic diarrhea because most pancreatic cancer affects the area of the pancreas primarily responsible for digestive enzymes. When I was in practice and I had people coming in with these symptoms, I would always ask questions about the diet. Unfortunately, doctors don to pick up exactly why a lot of people have these problems just because they on the wrong diet. Just simply changing the diet could clear up all these symptoms if you don Number five is interesting, diabetes. What potentially could happen is that a tumor in the pancreas could be disrupting the cells that produce insulin. you have this overp production of insulin and then your body is compensating for the high blood sugar and it does that for many years until the point where your pancreas is just kind of just too tired and it stops producing insulin. Now you can regulate the sugar, you can the blood sugar so your blood glucose goes higher and that six, you feel full really quickly when you eat just a little bit of food. This symptom can definitely come because you and you quick. If you have pancreatic cancer, that could be one of them as well. Number seven, persistent fatigue. Of course, there reasons why you can be tired. A lot of people just consider fatigue normal and so they just kind of just live with it or they might drink some more caffeine. Usually with pancreatic cancer, you have this overwhelming persistent fatigue that be. It just doesn more sleep. Let uniquenesses with pancreatic cancer. One thing you don pancreatic cancer is consume sugar. There cancer has some bacteria inside of it. And so now they the microbiome to see if there type of improvement you can make in the microbiome to potentially change this cancer. That research uh project right now. Also, the problem with this type of cancer is the outside of the tumor is super thick and dense. That inside of it like completely without oxygen. And anytime you have a lack of oxygen, that triggers the cancer to spread more. The other unique thing about this cancer is it aggressive. The most important thing that a person should do if they diagnosed with this type of cancer is immediately start doing prolong fasting. Periodic prolonged fasting is a very safe, effective way because as you fasting, you of resources. You see, the cancer not only needs fuel, but it also needs a membrane. The cancer is going after resources to build itself, even making that more of a priority than just getting fuel. The other thing that interesting about pancreatic cancer is that it usually happens after you or 50 or even 60 years old and even older. The fact that it happens as you get older, it gives us a clue that it must be related to some type of chronic inflammation in that duct which relates to food and lifestyle. Anything we can do to reduce inflammation will be a very very good thing. A big risk factor for this type of cancer is smoking tobacco. I think the risk goes up by 25%. Also, obesity and type 2 diabetes puts a person at risk. Usually, if you overweight and you eating carbohydrates, refined carbohydrates and sugar and things like that. A lot of inflammation in the area of the pancreas because the pancreas is at the heart of digestion. There are also certain genes that put the person at risk, but those genes are normally expressed more or triggered if the person is smoking or eating poorly. Alcohol is another big risk factor. There vitamin D in cancer in general. Vitamin D does several things related to cancer. It can help to shrink cancer. Number two, can help increase our immune system have cancer, you want to keep your blood level of vitamin D pretty high. Personally, I would keep mine over 100, maybe up to 150 nanogs per milliliter. But the most important thing is avoiding cancer. Okay, so how do we do that? Well, getting enough sleep, reducing your stress, exercise, intermittent fasting, because it gives the pancreas a chance to rest. Someone meals or even six meals a day. you just hitting that pancreas over and over and over with just repetitive stress. And if you wrong foods and creating this chronic inflammation, not good. There handful of really good remedies that have very specific targeting effects over cancer. And I taking all of these, but I just want to mention them. Cruciferous vegetables, green tea, another one is allisonin that bourberine. Bourberine can help mimic certain effects of metformin and also metformin has been found to help reduce risk of cancer and I will put the documentation down below so you can do your own research. This video is about identifying early uh warning signs against pancreatic cancer. You know, I live on a farm and all day long I identifying early signs of problems on the farm. Just yesterday, I the air and I birds flying around in a circle like hawks. I could ignore that or maybe just think, having fun going around a circle or they could be targeting something. walked over there. Sure enough, there was a baby sheep, very tiny, that was just delivered stuck in a pricker bush. The mother can freed up the little baby and the mother took this baby into the woods and um birds went away. The moral of the story is you don signs or symptoms that your body is trying to let you know there problem. But then again, don paranoid about these symptoms. I a lot of videos on symptoms and talking about the most common reason for symptoms, and that thing to go after first. But if it doesn deeper.	Success

Simple Trick to Fix Bad Circulation & Blood Flow in Your Feet and Legs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TruE9w7PO4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I was taught that the heart is the primary pump for all the circulation. But there that you how to improve the blood flow through your legs and your ankles and your feet. But there problems that occur when you have poor circulation. Edemon, swelling, painful feet as well, cramps in the feet and the calves. I and then relate them to a really simple solution. I several important exercises. This information is based on a book called understanding the heart by a Steven Hussy. In one part of the book, he talked about trees. How do trees pump this water from the roots all the way up to the leaves? They don What he has found through a lot of scientific research is that the heart spins the blood. And when you put water through a vortex and even underneath the earth, you have moving water. Water always should move. It shouldn sitting there. Really the theory of this is the heart is acting as a mechanism to create structured water to allow it to kind of go through the body. Now we do know the heart is very very electrical. I mean just think about what an EKG does, right? You electrical part of the heart. Part of the solution that he did is he started increasing more structured water throughout his circulatory system. And so this leads us to increase structured water in your blood. The best way to do that is to get more exposure from infrared. Over 50% of the sun is infrared. Infrared is just one little piece of the spectrum of light, which apparently has a lot of healing. I mean, a lot of people are using infrared for all sorts of things. But you can also make it to create more structured water in your circulation. More exposure to the sun is one important tip to improve the circulation in your legs and improve your heart function. You can get an infrared device. There saunas. You can even sit in front of a campfire or your fireplace. You to get a good amount of infrared from that. Infrared also is a wonderful thing for your arteries, especially to increase something called nitric oxide, which helps with blood pressure. And then you also have the vitamin D from the UV that automatically increases nitric oxide. Let swelling in your feet. Potassium is one of the best natural diuretics to get rid of excess fluid. You have to take maybe 1 to 2,000 milligrams per day. The combination of getting rid of all the sugar and the starch, that pasta, cereal, crackers, biscuits, waffles, pancakes, etc. Getting rid of those will get rid of a lot of fluid in your lower extremities. And the other thing about that is that when you consume a lot of sugar, you will deplete vitamin B1. Sometimes the pain in your toes or the bottom of your feet is related to that. And so you need to take something called benotamine to restore it in addition to your limiting your carbohydrates. Let have cramps. Sometimes people think that cramps really are poor circulation. They your feet is merely a magnesium deficiency. The thing about magnesium is that it because you only have 1% of your body magnesium in your blood. 99% is in the cells. And it mineral involved with blood pressure, making energy, and especially muscle because it works with calcium. It controls calcium. In fact, one of the medications for blood pressure is called a calcium channel blocker. Well, guess what magnesium is? It calcium channel blocker. Why don just use magnesium? Because you can patent it. Magnesium is really important for blood pressure, but it essential to get rid of cramps. But sometimes you have to take enough over a long period of time. I recommend taking about 800 milligrams per day in the evening for some weeks until you get rid of your cramps and then you can reduce it down to 400 milligrams per day. You want to take magnesium glycinate because that and it doesn mistake, compression stockings. If you already have problems with your arteries being constricted and you use these compression stockings, you constricting blood flow. Not the best thing to do. Now, let varicose veins. There remedy for that, diosmin, and it can help with varicose veins. Another uh little mistake that I think people make when they have circulation problems is they start doing highintensity type exercise. If you have a a problem with the lower part of your body, whether it go light on the exercise. You do not want to do any high intense anything, okay? You don sprints just because there could get worse. Walking would be the best thing. Let In this first exercise, we combine elevating our legs with an ankle pump. So, you will be lying on your back with your feet up on your wall while you move one foot at a time back and forth and you lower extremity back to the heart. The combination of elevation and the pumping motion is great to push fluid from the lower extremity back up to where it needs to go. That next one I ankle pump while you let through the day. You can literally just do this ankle pumping underneath your desk with this next exercise is really, really good because it involves activating more of the muscles in your calf and in your shin at the same time. And this is called heel to toe rocking. In this first one, you holding something, whether it or something to stabilize yourself so you don basically going to go through this motion where you you and forth. You 10 times, okay? And you can do that a few times through the day. But this is one of the best exercises if you want to push fluid from the lower part of the body up to the heart. And then after you get good enough, you can do this without any support. And basically stand there and do this rocking motion to allow your body to adapt so you depend on holding something. And I would recommend just doing it 10 times, okay? And then do that several times during the day. Recovered circulation, edema, swelling, pain. But what about cold feet? What can you do for cold feet? That is normally an iodine deficiency because the thyroid is low. Sea keelp is one of the best sources of iodine. You can take that. That your thyroid so you can actually have warmer feet. So, I gave you a lot of things to do today. Go ahead and apply some of them and then please come back and comment down below on how it worked for	Success
My Best Tips of All Time: Dr. Berg [Upgraded Advice]	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvBR-GoBvzk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I want to give you an updated list of my top tips to be super healthy. A lot of these tips I are based on my mistakes. And if you apply these tips, you a lot of your health problems. Let start with tip number one. You only want to eat when you want to eat if you sounds too simple, right? For yours, right at the end of dinner, I snacked constantly. I never really paid attention to my hunger. I just like food and I just kept eating. But if you were just to wait until you hungry and eat, your body would do so much better. Don hungry. Number two, drink liquid when you not thirsty. This ideal that we have to drink so much liquid is based on false information. You electrolytes, especially sodium. Now, we can end up with a situation where you creating more dehydration when you drinking more liquid. The next tip relates to that tip I just mentioned. I find that when I drink carbonated water, I feel more hydrated. When I drink regular water, for some reason, I as hydrated. The other thing that I do to hydrate myself is when I drink liquid, many times I there that For some reason, when I drink tea, I get way more hydrated. I can drink more water. It just feels better. And plus, I tea. I will take a gallon glass jar and I couple teabags in there and I outside in the sun for 1 to two hours. The sun gives it infrared. Infrared actually makes structured water, which is really healthy. I lately and my body loves it. Next tip. If you have a confusion of what diet to do or what food to eat and you really don and try one diet and see how you feel. Try the other diet, see how you feel. then you you. So, I to do a certain diet or certain food, but I am interested to get someone to try something out to see if it actually works for them. The next tip, intermittent fasting. The frequency of when you eat might sound like an insignificant thing, but it important as what you eat. Because all sorts of amazing positive things happen when you do intermittent fasting. Our bodies were not developed or designed to consume food every hour and a half. If we can match what our bodies are used to eating as far as the frequency, we can actually achieve a much greater level of health. It proteins and it new tissue. It pathogens and getting rid of bacteria, viruses, fungus, mold, and that happens when you relates to the next tip. Out of all the things that you can do that you, it meals. Why? Because again, it spikes that insulin, especially if you snacking on junk food. Out of all the things that a person could do to improve health, if they just got rid of their snacking, that would create a huge change. Even if they don diet, the next tip, too much carb. When you important thing to look at is the carbohydrates. Not necessarily just the sugar because a lot of these foods don have any sugar, but at high carbs because they malttodextrin, flour. That hidden sugar. Keep your carbs on the low side. In fact, in a given day, you don want to consume more than 30 g of carbs per day. And this rolls into the next tip. When you get your blood test, I think it fasting insulin test for literally 10 to 15 to 20 years before you develop diabetes. Your fasting insulin levels are high, but the doctors never test that. So, if you were able to test your fasting insulin, you could literally prevent diabetes because if it was high, you could do something about it. And that leads us to the next tip that sort of related. And this is a blood test. Probably one of the most important blood tests is for vitamin D. At least 10,000 to 20,000 IUs of vitamin D every single day. It affects 10% of all of your genetics. And for some people that have autoimmune disease and chronic inflammation and other problems that relate to a poor immune system, they going to need much, much higher levels of vitamin D to create the effect. It really important to test vitamin D and you can even do a home test. I to put that link down below. Then the second most important nutrient to focus on is your magnesium. Most people don consume enough magnesium in their diet, so usually they magnesium to help vitamin D work. Magnesium helps control calcium. Calcium causes contraction of the muscles, a muscle cramp, a spasm, and when you get those, you have too much calcium. But magnesium can come in as a remedy and get rid of that problem because it controller of calcium. Now, let the next tip. That look at all the nutrients you need in amounts. Potassium is the one we need in a very very large amount. We need like 4700 milligrams of potassium every single day. Potassium is a physiological tranquilizer. It calms the nervous system down. It helps lower blood pressure. It also helps increase your energy. It good for the heart. The next tip relates to vitamins. The multivitamins that make the most money. Like I billions, okay? Okay, and I to mention their names, have the worst ingredients in the world. Nothing is from food. It Don quality. But you have to realize that even like the vitamin C, they make it from cornstarch and sulfuric acid. If you vitamin to a child or pregnant woman, I would make sure it other thing that is trace minerals. A lot of the food that you eat doesn minerals it had long ago. the microbes are not in the soil because we growing stuff on sterilized soil. When you something that has a lot of nutrients. So, let hydroponics like in water with 15 added minerals, you trace minerals that you need. One additional supplement that I would recommend is a trace mineral supplement because a lot of people are deficient. The trace minerals would be zinc, iodine, manganese, selenium, things like that. Next tip. Out of all of the proteins that you can consume, red meat is one of the most nutrientdense. If you want to feel really good and you want to be more energetic or you want to handle your low blood sugar, red meat will do the trick very quick. It you right up. Not necessarily for the iron, it because our bodies really need uh sufficient protein. And grass-fed red meat will give you the highest quality. Next tip. If you a history of a lot of antibiotics, realize that a lot of your problems now could be related to the antibiotics. We were told that when we take an antibiotic that those microbes will come back. A lot of strains do come back, but not to the level where they should be. And one of the most powerful things you can do is make your own probiotic yogurt-like uh mixture, which creates some of the most amazing effects in your body. And when you watch the video that I will put down below, read the comments. It mind-blowing. People are noticing all sorts of amazing cool effects from that. But all we the microbes that used to be in our gut long ago before we took an antibiotic. Next tip is overtraining kills your testosterone. If you overtrain and don let your body recover, not only are your hormones going to be messed up, but you will not achieve the gains and the improvements that you could, and you going to find your energy is going to go down, down, down, down, and so many other issues can occur, especially with inflammation. Next tip. If you go off the wagon and you eat too many carbs, what you should do is take vitamin B1 because you just depleted B1 and that going to create more anxiety and stress which could cause you to eat more of the wrong foods. Take more B1 to repair some of the damage and also get rid of some of the side effects that are occurring because you just ate that carb. Next tip, be careful of taking any iron supplements. Out of all the nutrients, iron is the one that doesn leave your body. Probably the only time I would recommend taking an iron supplement is if you are menrating and you lost blood, but even then the type of iron I would take would be a food source. Either beef liver or liver tablets, but not the type of iron in those supplements. Next tip. If you over 50 years old and let fatty arms or you have extra fat or cellulite on your body, chances are you may have a bit of atrophy. not necessarily fat. And if you don differentiate that, you can go uh on a diet for a long period of time and it looks like you may be losing a little weight but don anything significant because it related atrophy of the muscle. Biggest thing to prevent that is regular consistent exercise, weight training, and magnesium too. Next tip, if you ever in your life get any surgery for any reason, always take a good amount of vitamin D right before. I would take at least 50,000 IUs of vitamin D3, maybe up to 100,000 IUs 3 days before the surgery because hands down, the outcome of any surgical procedure is going to be so much better if you have enough vitamin D. Another really important time to take vitamin D is when you you important for you and the baby because if you going to get postpartum depression. the child can end up with all sorts of weaknesses. Lastly, I think this is really super important. Invest in a good water filter. When you drink city water, there chemicals in there. I just tested my water and I have two filters and it had a chemical that was 78,000 times higher than normal. The point is, you need to invest in some type of filter. Don water. A lot of these tips were based on personal experience. So, don mistakes I made. apply this information and I will see you in the next	Success
#1 Best Food to Unclog Arteries	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q	Dr. Eric Berg DC	the number one best food in the world that can help unclog your arteries, prevent a heart attack, and a stroke. This is better than aspirin. Aspirin has been around for 4,000 years. I don know if you can see it, but it little over-the-counter pill that for pain, fever, and yes, aspirin has saved a lot of lives. Hundreds of thousands of people over the years have been helped by aspirin. Before 2022, a lot more people were taking aspirin. And I think it was recommended for everyone over the age of 60 to take a baby aspirin every day to prevent heart attacks and stroke. But then a report after 2022 said no, not everyone should take this because there minor complications like bleeding ulcers, bleeding in the brain. Aspirin does come with a package. It can cause side effects and it The reason why a lot of people take aspirin to help prevent a heart attack is because it thins the blood. What I mean by thinning the blood is it reduces the formation of a clot. 80% of all heart attacks and strokes come from a clot, not the blockage of cholesterol building up and forming plaque. And just as a side note, almost 50% of heart attacks occur between 6 a.m. and 12 noon. And my theory about that is you have higher levels of cortisol in the morning. And both cortisol and adrenaline can increase clotting and increase your chance of getting a heart attack or stroke. This is why you have something called the broken heart syndrome where a loss of a loved one can increase your chance of getting a heart attack and a stroke by like 2,000%. Let me simply explain what aspirin does. In your blood, okay, you have these arteries, right? And you have red blood cells that travel through the arteries. They carry oxygen. You also have white blood cells. your immune cells, but you also have these little things called platelets that are attracted and respond to injury. In other words, if these were platelets and they injury, they would start to connect and form a clot. Some people take this other drug called warin, which blocks vitamin K1. It prevents that superglue from forming, keeping the blood thinner, so you can prevent a clot. What else could do the same thing but with less side effects if any side effects? And before I talk about the actual food that will do this, let ingredient in that food that does the magic of preventing this clot formation. And that compound is omega-3 fatty acid. Now, when I say omega-3, you might think of fish oils, right? And that It a little more specific than just fish oils in general. In omega-3, you have two things. You have EPA and you have DHA. The real key factor is the EPA part of that omega-3 fatty acid. How does it compare to aspirin, for example? Well, in this study, they showed that EPA worked to decrease clotting comparable to lowd dose aspirin. EPA has the ability to stabilize vulnerable arterial plaquing by decreasing inflammation. And when you decrease inflammation, you also reduce the chance of rupture and having some plaque break off and then float through your artery. There another study 2019 patients were taking EPA, which is the omega3 fatty acid, and they had significant decrease in plaquing, decrease inflammation, and decrease cardiovascular events by 25%. What another effect that goes beyond anti- clotting and it has an effect on your mood. It has the effect of reducing cortisol and adrenaline. Remember I talked about that. So we have this additional benefit which can also prevent the clotting formation. How does EPA work compared to aspirin and warin which are blood thinners? Instead of making super glue, you that float around but they sticky. The omega-3 fatty acid EPA replaces a key ingredient. So, the superglue can first place. Why do I like that approach so much? Is because there effects. Aspirin and warin has side effects, but EPA really doesn look at the best food that has EPA, you do have salmon, mackerel, you have any of the fatty fish, you also have fish oil, and all of those have plenty of EPA. But there that has some extra benefits to take this to the next level. And that would be cod liver oil as well as cod liver. But either cod liver oil or cod liver will give you EPA. But it also gives you two additional factors that can, like I said before, take it to the next level. Vitamin A and vitamin D. Vitamin A and I retinol. It helps the repair of the internal skin of the body, the sinuses, the colon, the lungs, the inside of the arteries. Vitamin A has potent anti-inflammatory effects. It can also help uh decrease atheroscllerotic plaquing in animal studies. But adding vitamin D in there takes it to the next level. In one study, out of a thousand compounds, vitamin D was the most effective to prevent damage to the internal layer of your arteries. This is why a lot of people take it for high blood pressure because it increases nitric oxide through that inside layer called the endothelial layer. Vitamin D decreases the stiffness of the arteries. It helps to stabilize plaquing so the plaquing doesn also has been known to help prevent rupturing and decrease arterial calcification with the help of vitamin K2. So, the number one best food for unclogging your arteries or maintaining the health of the arteries to prevent a heart attack or stroke is cod liver oil or cod liver. And again, you can buy it in a can. Make sure it Thanks so much for watching and I will see you in the next	Success
DO NOT Fail This Brain Test (For Early Dementia)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OErFtjHismU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	You do not want to fail this brain test for early dementia. It secondond test. I want you to get a piece of paper and a pen out right now. And I Early dementia is not just about memory loss. It could also be about the speed at which you process information to slow down your attention, your focus. We going to take the 30 secondond test together to see if there with early dementia. This is actually called the clock drawing test. When I press start, you clock with the time set at 10 minutes after 11:00. And then after the test, I have a problem with dementia. Okay, are you ready? All right, start. Okay, stop. This is what I have right here. If you could see this thing right there. First question is, were there any numbers that were jumbled up or missing? Did you write in all 12 numbers all spaced out correctly? Were the hands of the clock facing in the right directions? Did you reverse the hour and the minute hands or did you have that correct or did you not complete this project in 30 seconds? Now, what interesting about this test is that it one of the most sensitive indicators for early uh cognitive deficits and it even more accurate than memory test which is pretty wild. Certain neurologists use this in early indicators of Alzheimer if you didn fine. Don show you what to do to reverse early dementia. And by the time you get 50, it starts to accelerate. And so the big question is, and what causes dementia? One of the biggest things that starts to break down the brain is sugar. Sugar shrinks the brain, especially uh a part of the brain called hippocampus, which is all about memory. In fact, look at type 2 diabetes with a diabetic. They have a lot of brain issues. This is why Alzheimer diabetes. But there also can cause this problem. Chronic stress and they cognitive problems. What is one night of bad sleep causes the brain to be just a little bit smaller and even can create a little plaquing that begins. Why is that? Because one of the purposes of sleep is to detoxify the brain. The question is, how do we reverse this shrinkage? How do we protect our brains from getting early dementia in the first place? There are two things we want to increase in the brain. One is something called BDNF, brain derived neurotrophic factor because it helps to grow brain tissue and it helps to prevent cognitive problems and depression and all sorts of problems with the brain. And now I going to go through things that can increase your BDNF. And the last one being the most powerful. Number one, intermittent fasting increases BDNF, especially when you start doing a 16-hour fasting cycle with an 8 hour eating window, which actually is very easy to do. Number two, cold therapy. Whether it plunge, when you start introducing this cold therapy, oh my gosh, it what it does for the brain. It creates all sorts of stress that indirectly activates certain systems that help you become very alert. your mood starts changing. If you had a lower mood, you higher mood. It who have depression and especially anxiety. And of course, people have anxiety about getting into the cold bath because every single cell in your body is saying no. But the way that I deal with it is I just basically tell my body, you a choice. And then all of a sudden, I calm and I focus my attention going outward. I don It works. Next one is deep sleep. Getting deep sleep detoxifies the brain. It help heal the brain and recovery of the entire body, especially for dementia. Next one is learning difficult tasks or skills. In other words, challenging your mental state to do certain things and learn things can actually increase BDNF. And the last more powerful thing to increase BDNF is highintensity interval training, especially as you get older. And that type of exercise is the most potent to increase your brain function. And of course, having a sedentary lifestyle where you don brain just shrivels up. What thing now that can help reverse dementia or even protect you against dementia? Ketones. Ketones are an alternative fuel to glucose and they the brain. How do we increase ketones? Low carb diet. Bring your carbs way down. And by doing that, you the thing that actually causes dementia, which is high sugar in the blood. A low carb diet can reverse diabetes in 10 weeks. Then we get into MCT oil, coconut oil that has ketones. You can feed your brain. You can actually take ketones as a supplement. That good for someone that has dementia. Another thing that you could do to boost up your ketones is we want to keep the insulin low. If you keep your protein in a moderate amount and not too high, you can also keep your insulin a little bit lower and get into deeper ketosis. To get into ketosis, it having a massive amount of protein. You want a moderate amount of protein, but you don restricting your fats. Tell me how you did on the test. Thank you so much for watching and I will see you in the next	Success
Why Men Are Fading: The Hidden Testosterone Crisis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap90NXxSS0g	Dr. Eric Berg DC	One of the biggest causes of lowered testosterone is chemicals and plastics in the environment. Plastics in your food that you eat, forever chemicals, pesticides, insecticides, herbicides. If you chemicals, the cells that make testosterone are going to be affected the most. This is more of a problem than most people realize. I interview one of the top experts, Dr. Mark Richards, who specializes in testosterone replacement therapy. I learned some things I before. When you hear about uh testosterone replacement therapy, a lot of side effects come up like you do research and there risk for cardiovascular prostate problems. I want to know more about that point because I don true or false. Interesting enough, last week the FDA just pulled their caution on heart disease and stroke off of testosterone warning label because it was proven that not only was it not true, but actually testosterone therapy done properly greatly reduces risk of heart attack and strokes. Interesting. You have different types of uh application, right? You have the injection which you have to get frequently and then you have pellets and you have creams. Tell me a little bit about each one. What kind of effects would be created one versus another? The method of delivery in testosterone therapy has everything to do with the health benefits that you receive from it. So, we first. They found only 20% of the time did you actually get to a therapeutic range and then only for a number of hours, not even for a day. Uh, when you do an injection, you get a massive spike in testosterone. It causes all the other hormones and things that testosterone makes to get overproduced for a short period of time. The first 36, 48 hours, he estrogen and that can make him irritable. That can make him aggressive. And many spouses, if you talk to them, will say they don their husband when he testosterone for the first two days. In other words, when you inject testosterone, your estrogen increases. 100% of the estrogen in your cells, whether you from testosterone. I questions like, um, some people want to get injections with testosterone, but then you have to get those every week or even a couple times a week, right? So, you back and forth. Is that how they do it? Yeah, that goes up and down and up and down. And that any of the animal kingdom was designed. Testosterone is is the most abundant active hormone in both men and women. What about the pellets? The pellets have been used in the United States and and let compressed pure testosterone, no coating, about the size of a tic tac. Those pellets are placed into the fat through a little poke in the skin with a metal straw. You numb it up with lidocaine so it doesn they since 1940. And uh they are highly effective. They women. Um, I can tell you that 60% of my pellet patients in my practice are female. You dose people with pellets so that their tissue levels or cellular levels are at their optimum. And you can tell that from the symptom relief that they experience and the disease improvement they experience and the disease prevention they see. There must be some type of slowly dissolving mixture that they have this testosterone in that kind of just gradually goes into the body. Yes, that question, Dr. Burke. From my 17 years of experience in this, it seems to be that the fat cells absorb testosterone and then they release it as your body needs it. So, if you and lift heavy weights four to five days a week, you may actually use up your pellets faster than if you are very sedentary and, you know, sitting in your office and eating M&M get more of a stable release. It It 100% guaranteed to be released, so you don it state for four months in men and three months in women. So this is a fantastic option. It there can go wrong with it. The type of testosterone that you pellets versus the injections. Is that a different type? They use testosterone cypronate usually in injections. It compound with that binds testosterone and the enzymes in your muscles. The testosterone pellets is honestly just 100% human testosterone. That crystal and white powder that compressed. The pellets are just the pellets are just 100% testosterone, right? The injections are a compound and it requires an enzyme in your body to cleave it. And it may be the cyprrenate really isn as having free cyprienate in your body. The real problem is that that spike way up and way down is just not good. Your cells can right amount of estrogen. They can make the right amount of anti-inflammatories. What material do they get pellet testosterone from? Where does it come from? So, um, testosterone is a a very simple compound to create in nature. There or seven steps in a lab and it converts that ring into testosterone. You know, because when you talk to people, you know, that have had the injections, there with mood and other things, but I haven these pellets. That the way your body was designed to have testosterone. You know, when it state, that optimum health and that the least diseased and the least susceptible to obesity, diabetes, depression, anxiety, all these other disorders that are classic low testosterone symptoms. I guess the argument is like why would we even need testosterone in the first place? Why would we need pellets? I mean, it natural. I had that very question about 17 18 years ago when I first started learning about this and it took me a while to track it down, but the literature is pretty clear. If you look at our levels now in in 2025 compared to 1970, our population on average is 60% lower than we were. And the culprit seems to be hormone disrupting chemicals. When someone goes to a lab and gets their testosterone tested, there to compare it to. On your website, you talk about that might not be the the most accurate way to know that you have sufficient testosterone. Go ahead and tell me more about that. I already told you we were in 1970. So when you look at some of these ranges now, you can laugh a bit because some of the ranges or all the ranges I see from these labs include levels that are just severely low and linked to double the risk of death over the next 5 years. And in women, we don even study women in this country with testosterone even though it abundant bioactive hormone. It impossible to avoid all these endocrine disruptors. You can do good things like eat out of glass containers. You know, you can not have processed food. Don use 10 cans. Only eat organic foods if you can, organic meats, but you got to breathe the air. And there microscopic plastic that gets absorbed through your lungs in the air on every continent on the planet. It battle. We can try our best to stay healthy, but eventually the poisons overwhelm us. And if we want to stay healthy, I think we need to use testosterone pellets in most of the population after a certain age. What about women? It would seem like, oh, she going to grow a beard and uh you know, is that true? First of all, let care care of the aggression thing. Estrogen is what causes aggression. Um, you know, if you look at teenage girls and teenage boys, you know, the may violence may be different with the boys, but the actual aggression and meanness that comes from estradile, it bear, papa bear issue. As far as uh hair, testosterone does stimulate hair follicle growth. Women genetically don have beards. They have hair follicles on their chin and and lip um and other areas. Interesting enough, 80% of women over 50 have to treat their facial hair somehow with plucking, shaving, waxing, whatever. So, I problem with testosterone pellets. If my dose gets too high, I may increase their problem to where they don with it. So, I just lower the dose. If you adult acne, it can make it worse a little bit. So, there the acne on the pellets. And that that is the hormone that makes you chill and happy. What type of benefits are you seeing with your patients? We had been taught as doctors that menopause was caused by a deficiency of estrogen and that that is not a true story. Menopause is caused by a deficiency of testosterone and testosterone makes all the estrogen in your cells. Treating a woman with estrogen for menopausal symptoms uh as was proven in a big study in 1985 is highly ineffective. I was taught that, you know, it that drops down and they don talk about testosterone. It that Uh but that estrogen. I didn fascinating. And then what about some of the benefits for men? It things. People don menopausal symptoms that we know about in women are the exact same symptoms that men get. Well, except for vaginal dryness. They don other than that, um you know, they have the same, you know, mood disorders, hot flashes, they have night sweats, they have depression. It all gets fixed when when you restore them to healthy levels. So their cells have adequate testosterone to run the whole machinery of life. You know, people this fear like, oh, it But I I think what you actually no no it your heart if you have enough testosterone. I think this is a great solution especially the biioidentical from the um wild yams versus the injections if someone was considering doing this. Yeah, it That certainly sums it up. There uh like hyper attention on not just your total testosterone but your free testosterone. And I know uh on your website you don on that. Testosterone is what we call actively transported. In other words, if you can imagine a claw on all your cells surfaces that when it sees testosterone come by on the bloodstream, it grabs onto testosterone and it pulls it into the cell. You also check the iodine because iodine is kind of a co-actor to help with the absorption in addition to zinc and probably magnesium, right? just sort of by accident since 1940. Uh they found that iodine is a co-actor or let say the gasoline for that claw that makes it work to grab the testosterone and pull it into the cell. So when your iodine is low um your claw won and your intracellular testosterone level will be low even if your blood level is high. Amazing uh information. Of course you know RFK he takes he does the testosterone pellets right? Yep. That that on video. Yeah. And he he looks pretty pretty good in shape. So, looks like uh he doing poorly off that. So, that quite amazing. Yeah. And and one thing that um you brought up in the beginning, but I didn that testosterone causes prostate cancer. We actually we actually found that testosterone causes prostate cancer cells to die. And furthermore, they started doing studies in the lab where you added testosterone to a prostate cancer tissue cell, you know, that you Um, and this was been pretty much borne out now since about 2008, 2010, um, by work up at Harvard and other places.

The #1 BEST Remedy for Dental Plaque (TARTAR)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94	Dr. Eric Berg DC	The number one best way to remove dental plaque, aka tartar. I stumbled on something that only going to get rid of your tartar, it will also help you prevent cavities. This is going to be really important with children as well as adults. Plaque and tartar or bofilm. When you think about bofilm, think of like this protective shield against your immune system that bacteria make this bofilm, this shield out of calcium and it certain microbe called streptoccus mutants. This is also the one that as well. So when you consume sugar and especially starches, that microbe will make a ton of acid and then it takes the sugar and then it starts making this glue like substance that then starts creating a shield or this bofilm gel aka tartar. And unfortunately, the acid is now trapped against your tooth, causing a breakdown of the actual enamel. And what microbe in other places in your body, including on the valves of your heart. But not only that, hidden deep in the plaque in your arteries, you this microbe. One thing you should also know is what when you add a sugar and a starch. that will form a glue that kind of sticks to your teeth even more than the sugar. How do we remove this plaque? Okay, of course, number one, stop eating sugar and starches. Number two, hydrogen peroxide 3%. Make sure it and use a half of a teaspoon. Hydrogen peroxide is very good to start breaking down this bile film and also make your teeth a little bit whiter. And then you of baking soda. All right, so why are we using baking soda? Well, it abrasive material that will help to cleanse the teeth. The big purpose is to alkalize the acidity in your mouth because baking soda is alkaline. And by the way, your body makes that as well. Your pancreas makes it to help neutralize the acids coming from the stomach. And then we three drops of the absolute best essential oil, clove oil. It helps to disrupt the bofilm and start breaking down the tartar. It also has other benefits of decreasing uh pain in your mouth. But you drops of this essential oil. So now I want to talk about this additional ingredient, micro crystallin hydroxy appatite powder. Okay, you can buy this on Amazon. It it material that bone is made out of. And you with these other ingredients. they can go into the small little crevices, the little cavities, and remmineralize the bone tissue and becomes the enamel around the tooth. Now, we can prevent the acid from breaking down the small crevices in your tooth. And then, of course, you teaspoon of water with this. Mix it all up, put on your toothbrush, and then in circular motions, brush your teeth on the outside and the inside once a day. I also recommend that you find a gum that has friendly oral bacteria that you can chew and repopulate your mouth with the good bacteria which will also help protect you against the formation of bofilms. Those bacteria not only will help prevent tartar but it will also prevent bad breath cavities. Now as far as in your diet, one of the best foods that you could consume to prevent all these problems that we talked about is grass-fed butter. When I was a kid, I craved butter. For my birthday, I remember requesting a pound of butter. And I would literally just eat it. I would eat butter. And it interesting when I look back, the reason why I craved the butter, I had a lot of dental decay. And unfortunately, every single tooth in my mouth had cavities over time. And I visited the dentist frequently, unfortunately. But if I didn and I had the butter, I probably could have fixed my teeth. But grass-fed butter has vitamin K2, which basically takes the calcium in your body and pushes it into the bones. Butter also has vitamin A. You also need vitamin A to keep your enamel very, very strong. It pioneer, Weston Price, who was a dentist back, I think in the 1930s or 40s, talked about something called Activator X. Activator X actually is vitamin K2 because he noticed some of the traditional cultures around the world consumed uh grass-fed butter. They consumed food high in vitamin K2 and these are the foods that really kept the teeth super healthy with also good uh dental bone structure as well. So I would definitely recommend including grass-fed butter in your diet on a regular basis. I mean butter does a lot. It has something else called butyrate which actually goes into your brain. Butyrate also feeds your colon cells. So wild that we were told to avoid butter because of the cholesterol and this idea that it problem when in fact it vitamin K2 that keeps the plaque from building up in the arteries pushing this calcium into your teeth and your bones. So butter is really good for the bone. It your hormones, including testosterone, because all of your sex hormones are made from cholesterol. Now that you have the updated protocol to get rid of tartar and prevent cavities, go ahead and try it and then comment down below and tell me how it worked.	Success
Depression Has NOTHING to Do With Your Brain	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g	Dr. Eric Berg DC	Depression has absolutely nothing to do with your brain and it has everything to do with your gut. So many people have been operating off of this idea depression is a chemical imbalance that you need to fix with SSRI selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor. Well, this chemical imbalance theory has never been proven. In fact, in some studies, it shows that people that are depressed have normal serotonin or even higher amounts of serotonin. In your nervous system, you have all these different hormonal like communications. One of them is serotonin. And serotonin does have an effect over your mood just like dopamine has an effect of motivating you. But what an SSRI does is it blocks the uptake of serotonin. Let example, we have a marriage, right? Okay, we have a husband and a wife and they sends a communication over to the wife, but she the SSRI effect, right? You wear earplugs and so then the husband starts shouting. Is that going to fix a marriage? No. Dr. Peter Goch wrote several books on this topic and he basically said SSRI are basically placeos. Hey, well, you know what? At least they right? Yeah. But what about the side effects? Okay? Because in his book, he talks about the massive serious side effects of SSRIs. Sexual dysfunction, no orgasm, decreased libido, you don experience emotion anymore. Worsening of the depression. Let with something like St. John John serotonin. It deals with dopamine. It an anti-inflammatory. It even reduces cortisol. And what does the medical profession say about St. John They say, not to take it because if you that and a psych drug, you might increase serotonin. very little side effects and it actually works better than the placebo because it of different things. And there interesting things about Prozac. Prozac is an SSRI. When Prozac came on the market in 1988, couple years later in 1990, there was a outbreak of some serious side effects where they had a bad batch of tryptophan. So the FDA decided to ban tryptophan for quite some time. They lifted the band of tryptophan right after the patents for Prozac ran out. Let gut makes serotonin. It also makes something called oxytocin, a very powerful hormone that can help people with depression, stress. Typically, people think about oxytocin as the hormone for bonding between a mother and a baby or um when a mother is breastfeeding. Oxytocin is also there to increase contractions during a pregnancy. So, it has multiple functions, but just realize that your gut makes oxytocin. And there is a highway between your gut and your brain. It communication from your gut to your brain is very very heavy. It And then we have 20% of information going from your brain down to the gut. So your brain is monitoring what on in your gut and then the rest of your your like your heart and other organs as well. That rest of your body through the vagus nerve. And so if your gut microbes are not doing well, this alone can create depression. In fact, when other studies when you take depressed people and you look at their gut microbiome, there are some serious missing microbes, this area of gut microbiome is completely underappreciated in the area of mental health. Also, if you have gut inflammation, you good moodwise. This is why what you eat is so vitally important with how you feel up here. And this is all very interesting, but when you also think about antibiotics, one of the big side effects of taking antibiotics is depression because you the good bacteria that controls your mood chemicals. It wipes them out overnight and then you think, the microbes will start grow back. a lot of times they don now you have this imbalance and you wonder why you practice, I would ask people, when did you start getting depressed? Did you take an antibiotic? Right before that, many times they would say, you know? chemical factory, good chemicals that will send chemicals up through this nerve, goes up to your brain, and infects your mood. If you have not seen my other video, I down below, but I want to tell you a little bit about this amazing microbe. You can buy elutery as a microbe in a supplement, but many times it the potency that you really need to create the effect. And Dr. William Davis told me about an amazing way to cultivate this microbe using uh ultra pasteurized half and half and you basically put it in a yogurt maker and for 36 hours and then you just take a half a cup a day. I for months and I want to tell you something. It first thing that my wife actually noticed is she kept saying like, Why are you hugging me five times a day? What\\ don this yogurt. It just makes me very social. I it yogurt. muscle is better because it increases stem cell for your muscles. It reduces stress. And if you watch my previous videos on this and you read the comments, it people are just getting amazing results with this probiotic. It acts as a natural antibiotic without any side effects that I could perceive. Another interesting point about El Ruter, like where does it come from? Well, it actually in mother Breastfeeding is is not as common as it was years ago. And antibiotics are extremely common. And so these gut microbes are something that we need to put more attention on. So I highly recommend that you cultivate this elder. I will put some information down below of exactly how to do it. And then you going to realize that your depression really had nothing to do with your brain and had everything to do with your gut. Thanks for watching.	Success

The SHOCKING #1 Cause of High Blood Pressure	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wgLehFAbc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	High blood pressure, hypertension is not a disease. It hypertension is a known cause. Well, today I cause is. When you start telling people that 90% of hypertension is unknown, you make the drug companies rich because you turn the person into an ATM for certain medications. It don cause is. Let me show you what the primary cause is. Okay, so here we have an artery. You have a certain layer. It cells. That cell layer has these little tiny receptors for insulin. And insulin triggers something that causes the artery to relax. When that receptor becomes damaged, you get high blood pressure. But the problem is if you fix insulin resistance, sometimes it doesn lower the blood pressure. The question is why? Because when you damage that receptor, the receptor won in anymore. Now it regulate and relax the blood vessels. Also, insulin causes too much calcium to go inside the cells. And this is why they use calcium channel blockers. The cause is insulin resistance. That ignored because like I said before, 90% of hypertension is unknown cause. So that give you a little bit more data. There is normally supposed to be a little protective shield around that endothelium, that layer. It like something on your frying pan that is a non-stick surface. And when that substance becomes damaged, then we get damage directly to cells and then you start having a cascade of issues where you get uh holes into the area, you get inflammation, calcium buildup, excess clotting. What shield? The glycoelix. And that glycoelix is super vulnerable to getting damaged from too much glucose or fructose. And it sugar actually destroys sugar, but it does. So when the sugar is too high or there getting this rusting out of that layer. It It dissolves it very quickly. And without it, you get a lot of damage inside that artery, especially hypertension. And I about that. But I first want to talk about some other things because insulin resistance also creates serious deficiencies of other nutrients that if you don a long time to get your blood pressure lowered. So, I combination of two different things to fix your hypertension very, very fast. Going on a low carb diet and doing intermittent fasting. And I also put the link down below of how to do that correctly. At the same time, we want to get the blood pressure down very very quickly. So, there to add to the low carb diet. Number one is vitamin D. But you must take at least 10 to 20, sometimes 30,000 IUs of vitamin D3 every single day to reestablish this. Second thing is magnesium. Magnesium glycinate is the one I recommend. Magnesium helps take the calcium out of the place where it shouldn calcium to magnesium ratios because what you need to know is calcium causes contraction. Magnesium causes relaxation. Plus, magnesium is going to help vitamin D to work. In fact, vitamin D won magnesium won They especially with hypertension. Plus, magnesium reduces cortisol and adrenaline. Magnesium also has anti-inflammatory properties. And magnesium helps reestablish that little layer, that protective glycoalics. The next nutrient that is important is potassium. And I would recommend taking a good amount of potassium. You can get potassium supplements in a,000 mg per serving size. But what potassium does is it directly helps to fix that glyicoal as well. And potassium reduces the sodium and potassium directly lowers blood pressure because it helps to relax the smooth muscle. And then the last thing you need to really get the blood pressure down is to increase your sulfur. Sulfur is going to help reestablish this protective sugar coating glycoallex. But I wouldn it in a supplement. I would get it from food. One of the best sources of sulfur is grass-fed red meat. Eggs also are loaded with sulfur, but it that some people will tell you that, oh, you don for blood pressure because it has cholesterol and blah blah blah. When in fact, the red meat and eggs will totally turn this thing around. So, to fix insulin resistance, we want to avoid too much carbohydrate. We want to avoid, of course, sugar, starch, we want to avoid seed oils because that can create inflammation. Also make sure when you doing this you do not have like the hidden carbohydrates. So in other words, I would really uh keep a food log and monitor your carbohydrates. You want to keep them really really low without cheating for a period of time. Sometimes it takes some weeks and then you going to start to see it come down. I would highly recommend getting a home uh blood pressure kit so you can test yourself throughout the day and monitor this. And on a rare occasion, you maybe the bottom number start coming down, but the top number might not come down. The top number is primarily a problem with the sympathetic nervous system. So sometimes you need to focus more on your stress by getting enough sleep, uh doing long walks, sometimes to take ashwagandha or maybe even more magnesium before bed. I you a really powerful solution for hypertension. You have to try it. Go ahead and then comment down below in the comments and thanks for watching.	Success
The Big Magnesium MISTAKE 50%+ People Are Making	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	The big mistake most people are making regarding magnesium, your blood levels show normal magnesium levels. What a lot of people don your magnesium in your body is inside your blood. 99% is deep in your cells. When your body is deficient in magnesium, it will rob magnesium from your bone, your muscle, and put it in the blood, giving you the illusion that you have enough magnesium if you relying on the blood test. There are more sophisticated, advanced ways to determine if you but I to figure it out. If you have any muscle spasms in your body, muscle twitch underneath the eyelid, anxiety, poor sleep, sugar cravings, and definitely Charlie horses are all clues that you deficient in magnesium. Typically, with the diet, you need about 400 milligs of magnesium every single day. Almonds are high in magnesium, but you would have to consume five cups of almonds to get that 400 milligrams. Or you can get your magnesium from spinach, but you would have to consume five big handfuls of spinach just to get 400 millig. What about chocolate? Isn magnesium? It would still need about four bars of chocolate to get your daily amount of magnesium. On top of that, there are many things that don absorb even the magnesium from the food that you eat. For example, if you have inflammation in the gut, that greatly reduce your absorption rates by up to 60 to 70%. grains in your diet, refined foods like refined sugar, starches, that magnesium. And then other things will deplete your magnesium like alcohol, caffeine, and also many medications. And of course, the top selling magnesium products are not the best ones to take because not only do they create diarrhea because they really don magnesium oxide, you only absorb like 3 to 4%. The one I would recommend is magnesium glycinate because that one that you absorb 80% and it doesn create a laxative effect and the glycinate part of it will help you sleep. Magnesium is one of the master controllers over calcium. You see, calcium has other purposes other than just making your bones strong. Calcium is also used in the body as the main communication signal between cells. And far too often we accumulate too much calcium inside the cell. And if there too much calcium in the cell, those calcium crystals start damaging certain parts of the cell. Literally, we calcify as we get older. And you may have heard of the vitamin K2 being the antidote for that because vitamin K2 helps to keep the calcium from accumulating in the arteries. But magnesium is even more important in helping to regulate excess amounts of calcium. Another thing that magnesium is really good at is preventing kidney stones. It has 100 times more binding force to the oxalates than calcium. And then let muscle. It muscle to contract and magnesium to relax. So anytime you have a tight muscle, that means you have way too much calcium, but really it It preventing any type of problem with the rhythm of the heart. You can correct atriofibrillation by taking enough magnesium over a period of time, but sometimes it might take months before you really correct that deficiency. You can of magnesium by just taking the maintenance dose. Sometimes you have to increase it to 1,000 to 1,500 or more milligrams every single day over a period of months. And this also includes dealing with things like migraine headaches, pain problems like fibromyalgia or pain syndromes. They require a lot more magnesium. And also mood disorders, people that are depressed or even have diabetes. Magnesium greatly helps blood sugar. It a high blood sugar situation creates on magnesium. It depletes magnesium. So the requirement of magnesium, it higher for a diabetic. Now let the three secrets. Number one is we used to get a lot of our magnesium from hard water. whether it well. And then we decided to filter the water like in city water, or send the water through a water softener, which actually removes the calcium and magnesium and replaces with sodium and potassium to make the water less corrosive on the piping and less harsh in washing your clothes. People don consume hard water anymore. In areas in the country where they don water, they have much less risk of getting heart attacks. And then if you compare that with areas that do use a lot of water softeners, the risk of heart attacks go up. Okay, secret number two, vitamin D won magnesium. If you magnesium, also increase your vitamin D and that way they will both work. And just as one side note, vitamin B1, which is really important in reducing stress and gets depleted when you consume a lot of carbohydrates, that also is dependent on magnesium. So when you take more B1, you need magnesium to allow that to work. And then the last and most important secret, magnesium has a super important role in some of your biochemistry. Deep in the cell, you have all sorts of motors that do the work of the cell. Like the one in the mitochondria that literally spins 200 to 400 times a second. It generates ATP. ATP is the energy currency of the body. And so your energy levels, your fatigue is related to how much magnesium you have. So, yes, magnesium helps lower cortisol, helps you sleep, but it also gives you energy. And if you have any type of fatigue, it could be because you magnesium. And because magnesium is so important, if you have not watched my other video on magnesium, I right here. Check it out.	Success
If You Sit All Day, THIS Is Falling Apart Inside You	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk	Dr. Eric Berg DC	This is why I stretch every single day. Here are the benefits that I found personally with myself. It helps my sleep. It helps reduce pain and decrease inflammation. And it takes me out of what And I also stretch to counter all of the injuries that I Most people have this confusion that the problem is the muscle. The muscle tight, so I need to stretch. That actually not true. What really becomes tight is something that we talk about called the fashca. If you think of a wet suit that surrounds the entire body, that would be fascia. And the thing about fashca, it connected. There short clip I want to share with you on the dynamics of how living or how alive your fashc is. Check this out. Alan launch of the National Institutes of Health, however, made a bizarre discovery while learning acupuncture. She noticed that as the needle was inserted into the skin, something seemed to be grabbing and pulling at it. When Lajivan took these results to the lab, an MRI revealed that the collagen fibers of the fascia were actually winding themselves around the needle like spaghetti on a fork. And what the fibroblast sent out chemical signals to the surrounding tissue, allowing it to expand and then relax. The fibroblasts that are inside the tissues up to several centimeters away, not just only at the needle, they expand. They they respond. It relaxes the tissue. So, the research is showing that the best thing for fascia is for it to move, to stretch, and not be stagnant. But what happens if you don If you tried to touch your toes in a very long time, and you have body parts that haven motion in a long, long while. When you injure your fashcia, you develop scar tissue. So, what happens? The fossil layers can no longer glide. They get stuck together like glue. Healthy fashcia is supposed to be dynamic, movable, flexible, and it even has electrical properties. And unhealthy fashcia, especially you develop some disorganized pattern of connective tissue. And you might think, have a stiff fashcia. And I teach you really amazing stretches that I do every single night to undo the all the bad effects of this accumulated stress that we have in our bodies. Probably the worst case scenario fascial problem is when someone has contraurs. You see people with bad posture that are literally stuck forward and they can get out of this posture. So it unfortunate where this connective tissue literally keeps you in a frozen state and now it stuck and it impossible to undo that. If you start to find your body in a certain position, you want to actively and aggressively undo that position so you can keep things erect and keep your motion in your body. I mean, very similar to when I broke my leg. And in just 3 weeks, I had a cast down there. Well, when I took that cast off, literally my whole leg and the ankle was just kind of frozen. I had to undo it. And yes, there was atrophy of the muscle, but the fashca actually grew in a certain position. Why? Because there was no motion. I didn those adhesions and get it back to where it should be. If I just left it like that, it would just literally over time just fuse in that position. And so there and there you can elongate that tissue, the better versus just a two-dimensional thing where maybe you that might help stretch your lower back, but I stretches. What you in this first stretch is you be holding this uh band behind your back. Stretching all the stuff in the front upper chest and shoulder area. This is where we hold a lot of tension and where gravity starts pulling it down. So, we Basically, leverage using uh the band behind your back while you are looking in a certain direction and creating as much uh length as possible in that area. So, I might do this for like 30 seconds and then I relax. This will take care of the tension in your back and the neck and the shoulders. Now, we stretch the side of your back and underneath your arm and the shoulder all at once where we bending exercise. And this really loosens up your shoulders by stretching in a position that you don stretch in. So, we side and then we as well. Number three is a very important area because it stretches out a muscle called the soaz. Soaz is a muscle in your core that attaches the upper body to the lower legs. And this muscle is the flexor of the hips. This gets tight when we sit all day or we drive long distances. So we do this with one leg first. And you just going to mimic what I right now. So we muscle at a time. Then the next stretch, we at the same time where you and you taking all that fosial tension through the core. This is like taking your spine and kind of like a and ringing it out. Okay, as we stabilize the lower part of the body with one side and then we reverse it and do the opposite side. All right, this last one kind of combines a couple things. is we using the band to get all the upper chest and your shoulders relaxed. So, we backwards with this band. Boy, this will take a lot of tension out of the entire body. So, sometimes people will tell you that the fashcia holds trauma. But when we get into emotions and severe stress and especially injury or even the most severe type of stress, which is uh major losses, I personally recommend the technique they use in dietics. And the word dynetics means what the mind is doing to the body. So let example you climbing a tree and the tree is in the front part of your yard and your friend ground your friend is laughing at you and at the same time it then your mother in the distance is saying come in and eat. It eat. Of course, we have the impact uh the dust uh around your sinuses and then the emotions that you might have of fear, the fear of falling. And on top of everything, maybe you went slightly unconscious. When that happens, things in that moment can act as triggers 20 years down the road or even longer. So, let raining and you feel achiness in your lower back and you someone instead of having like a kind of a mild reaction, you have a a really big reaction to that. All of those triggers in that moment of unconsciousness and pain can act like triggers later in life. And this really explains those things that are hard to figure out, especially with like phobias and weird body problems that just come out of nowhere. So yes, when you injure yourself, I think that the fashcia and the muscles can go in this protect mode. But what really is underneath that is the those mental pictures of that time where you had an earlier injury. In summary, if we all end up really stiff when we get older, you want to actively and aggressively prevent that from happening. Stretching on a daily basis is the ultimate answer for that. The type of stretching that you do is very important. I hope you now have some deeper insights on fashcia and how you should stretch that. Thanks for watching and I will see you in the next	Success
NEVER Drink Baking Soda Until You Watch This!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts	Dr. Eric Berg DC	Do not take baking soda unless you watch this video. Baking soda has the potential to help or even poison you. Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate. It an alkaline compound. And guess what? Your body makes it. Your pancreas makes it. As the strong acid comes from your stomach into the small intestine. If that pancreas does not release enough sodium bicarbonate, you don the benefits from the enzymes coming from the pancreas to help you digest fats and other things. This is why when someone they can get severe bloating, they get diarrhea, they get constipation. We need a really strong acid stomach and then we need an alkaline small intestine. Let talk first about the benefits of baking soda. Baking soda being an alkaline substance can be beneficial for temporarily relieving an acid stomach. I have to clarify something because when we talk about an acidic stomach, a lot of things come up. You might have like gird acid reflux. All those things are a little bit different because you never want to take baking soda when you have indigestion. Indigestion is like this backup of food that just you feel like your stomach is like cramping. That is a classic low acid or a lack of acid situation. So of course adding more baking soda is just going to go from bad to worse. Anytime you have indigestion, you need to take either apple cider vinegar or something called betane hydrochloride. it But when we get into more of an acidic stomach, whether it is acid reflux or gird, if you wanted some temporary relief as you fix the problem, a little bit of baking soda would help you, but just a little bit because usually those problems are also a lack of acid. But the baking soda will at least put the fire out and make you feel more comfortable. But then you would also want to do apple cider vinegar and or betane hydrochloride. Now, what about gastritis? You would want to take baking soda for sure, but also take something called zinc carnosine so you can actually heal that problem. But you just need to understand that the normal pH of the stomach is between 1 and three. That is like battery acid. And just don in a habit of taking baking soda for a long period of time because you to neutralize your stomach acids and now you to digest protein, the inability to absorb B12, an inability to absorb minerals, and also you be able to kill off any type of microbes or pathogens that might be in your food. Now, if you take baking soda for a long time chronically, is there really a chance of your blood becoming too alkaline? And the answer is probably not because the effect that baking soda has on our bodies is very temporary. If your body is too alkaline, uh you have symptoms issues with your muscles because of how that affects the electrolytes. Another really good benefit of baking soda is to help to neutralize the acid in your mouth from the bacteria that is forming these little bofilm tartar plaquing situations. So, baking soda could be one of the ingredients in your toothpaste and I actually show you how to make that. I will put that link down below. But ultimately, you got to get the sugar out of the diet because sugar is what making that acid. Another benefit of baking soda is to relieve itching from a kidney problem. When your kidney becomes damaged, you start developing too much acid and that can affect your skin, especially itching among other symptoms. One of the great antidotes to that is to take something to neutralize the acid and that takes the stress off the kidney. In fact, some people with kidney problems even take some baking soda to prolong going on dialysis because when the kidneys are damaged, it can regulate the pH anymore like it used to because a diseased kidney will make more acids. Now, another way I would use baking soda is let you even intermittent fasting and you carnivore. You and then you start feeling this uh acidity coming up through your stomach. some baking soda here and there can help uh chill that out, especially if you trying to sleep at night and it of coming up through your esophagus. Another unique beneficial way to take baking soda is if you you and you wanted the unfair advantage, you wanted to be able to do more reps. You wanted to go a little longer. You want a little better performance and less lactic acid buildup, which can actually stop you from using your muscles, especially with highintensity type activities. Because if you take all of it at once and feel nauseous, we want to avoid that. If you really want to know how much you should take, it kilogram of weight. Another benefit of baking soda is to help prevent kidney stones. So, if you kidney stones, you can take some baking soda because uric acid dissolves in baking soda. And this is why baking soda is also good in a gout situation, at least as a temporary action. Of course, ultimately you types of fructose, high fructose corn syrup, especially another way you can take baking soda is if you have a UTI. It so the microbes or the pathogens can exist anymore. And then the last benefit of baking soda would be some topical applications for some type of insect bite. If the insect that could make you worse. There are two insects that have an acid venom. So applying baking soda would help that. Ants, especially fire ants and bee stings, would benefit from putting some topical baking soda on the actual sting bite. So just get some wet and apply it to your skin. If you get stung by a wasp, do not put baking soda on that because those venoms are more alkaline. If you add more alkaline, you to make it worse. What you should put on that is vinegar. A spider bite. Don put baking soda on that. The best thing to put on that is either activated charcoal or bentonite clay, which has the power of like pulling things out of the skin. And then a snake bite. The best antidote for that is something called milk thistle. And as a side note, baking soda is also really good for insects, especially cockroaches, because if you add sugar with baking soda and you leave it out for the cockroaches, they reaction you their digestive systems will rupture and they will die. Okay? So that would be a natural way to get rid of these insects so you don around your house. The other thing you need to know about baking soda is you never want to take it with vinegar or lemon juice because it create so much uh carbon dioxide your stomach is going to bloat up with carbon dioxide. Not a good idea. And I think you already know this too. You can open a container of baking soda and keep it in the fridge and it gets rid of the odors. So, now that you know a little bit more about this uh home remedy baking soda, you should check out my apple cider vinegar video right	Success

Top 5 Weight Loss Mistakes Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zZWBPyQgFA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys it video I weight loss mistakes that everyone makes number one thinking it when it really is working many times the person is being successful burning fat but not weight loss because the muscle is increasing which is heavier as they to burn more fat increase body fat percentages some of the testing that I do uh is more sophisticated I can look deep into the body to see if you burning fat and if the person losing weight they but really it is working so the last thing you want to do is give up or change something when it working so here the focus on the size the clothes how the clothes is fitting forget the scale okay that the calorie model so they do this a lot in Weight Watchers where all calories are equal you know it doesn what kind of calories they are as long as you keep them lower that is not true because certain calories affect the weight differently for example let you have calories from protein like chicken or fish right and you have calories from fruit fruit will block fat burning especially if your metabolism is lower sugar will do the same so it hidden sugars so you really want to look at the type of food not necessarily the calorie so that especially with hidden sugars like fruit yogurt and you know about the grains and the pastas and the cereal and all that starches but I think the big one is is the fruit people don stop fat burning especially apples number three eating too many nuts so here the person is they go on an eating plan and what do they snack on tons and tons and tons of nuts and the problem with nuts is it a little bit at night you you even pistachios next thing you know you eating the whole bag so when you eat too many nuts what it does is it interferes with the gallbladder the liver and that creates bloating and that creates right shoulder pain so many people have that problem they nuts now the problem with nuts is that yes they might be low in calories whatever and they have some protein but there is a b a bit of fat in there and I it there is fat burning and you can measure it through the urine if you that means you ketosis diet is all about eating more fat the problem is if you your metabolism is low you may be burning fat but the fat that you burning is those nuts and not your own fat so yes you can overdo it with too many nuts and too much fat number four everything in moderation don that all the time you know it long as everything little bit it won the thing the purpose of fat is to protect you against the starvation of sugar fat is there is a backup fuel in case you run out of sugar that means that most people don burn enough fat because they never starve themselves of sugar they go on a low car diet which might not be enough starvation of sugar when you read labels always look at the sugar grams okay those must be zero you literally if your metabolism is slow you can moderation of sugars you have to do zero sugars to even be get into fat burning why because just a little bit of the wrong thing juice or candy or sugar can literally bump you at a fat burning for 24 to 48 sometimes 72 hours so let you drink a glass of wine on Monday and then Wednesday and then Saturday oh well good luck you just blew the whole week you because that a little bit of the wrong thing can bump you out of fat burning so this whole Theory of Everything in moderation is not workable if your metabolism is slow now the other thing is that we don we don want to go very very very high and that would be vegetables and I know you probably need to increase that so an average body needs between 7 to 10 cups of salad or vegetable every single day why because that will provide for the at least the minimum amount of uh nutrients especially potassium uh magnesium and a lot of the other electrolytes you need those foods to get that nutrition and if you it nutrition and then you create all sorts of other problems and I get into all the benefits of that but you don vegetables you want to go a lot unless you very high with those moderate protein and no sugar okay so that lastly we have number five focusing only on the weight this is a big one so the truth is you don problem you have a weight symptom the weight is the tip of the iceberg what deeper is a lot of health issues like sleep problems let sleeping if you not going to lose weight so you want to fix the sleeping let digestive problems constipated let you need to fix because if you lot of vegetables and you bloated that could be the reason why you instead of the weight I look for sleeping digestion inflammation uh your menstrual cycle hot flashes that would be hormones look for your energy level your mood your stress tolerance those are the factors that go beyond weight that will really make you successful with weight loss if you focus on them versus just the weight and calories okay so I hope you learn something from this but these are the most common mistakes with weight loss that everyone makes I	Success

Dr. Berg hosts a webinar on Anti-Aging and food	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faf5SIqhuhE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	welcome to the webinar everyone so in this webinar we um anti-aging I want to teach you some great things of to actually reverse aging processes it possible I think it is uh I people over the years and I found that um they do get younger as they get healthier so the goal is to make you younger every year that you age so that would be cool um so um I slides right now um let me just share my screen here make sure you can see everything okay so so here when we talk about anti-aging you know if you do research on the internet you there skin creams taking vitamins looking good on the outside using different um facial scrubs and that type of thing but there anti-aging than just a superficial putting a cream on your face try to get rid of wrinkles so we about two things one is how to look youthful as you get older but we going to talk about you know the heart of anti-aging which is to postpone your life to prevent dying in an early age um we going to talk about that because because it makes no sense to you know try to look young while you get cancer you know and dropped out of a heart attack so I want to cover both things today um and I wanted to mention that um one of the things that really emphasize is to um increase a health Reserve to build up a kind of a health insurance reserve and there is a test that can be measured to look at the internal health Reserve and I have one of my patients that we just today were uh evaluating we looking at her health reserve and trying to build that up and I just want to kind of show you this little graph here you can see there dial and a small dial The Tall dial should be straight up and down and the small dial should be all the way to the right so if the small dial goes to the left that that person is losing their their kind of their recovery reserve and I look at that as kind of like the the deeper Health Reserve this test just to keep it really simple without giving you a lot of big words is um it rate variability it measures uh the data in between the heart beats it measures how elastic the heart is it measures how the heartbeat varies from one beat to another and it one of the best indicators of overall mortality from heart attack so um I don prediction on how healthy you are overall but also for the heart um the the reason I because I these graphs and there has only been one person that has ever had a perfect graph and he was 80 years old and I is this guy he was walking down the street with his dog he falls in a hole hit knocks himself out he lays there for three hours knocked out unconscious wakes up his head home he has a stiff neck he sees me three days later his wounds are almost healed um he has a slight stiffness in his neck so he had a per perfect graph and I apparently when he was younger he took the Olympics in water polo and he maintained his health ever since that so so he could basically hold his breath three and a half minutes uh underwater at this point so out of all the things all the workouts all the sports events I would say that um water polo is probably the most incredibly difficult I almost drowned try to uh do this sport uh in college with my roommate who was into water polo he would just hold me underneath water until I let go of the ball and he would anchor his foot into the drain pipe until I you know cooperated so it in other words I you know that it is possible to um measure your health reserve and um it is possible to improve it so let me go to the next slide here so I think we should probably start this whole webinar by isolating what are the top causes of death uh if you look it up this is they WebMD it chronic respiratory accident stroke Alzheimer nefritis that suicide so those are the top causes of death but they forgot to mention one big cause of death and that probably the number one it is not probably it is the number one cause of death and that is conventional medicine now in the next slide you can look at the links because I everyone these uh these PDF uh files but the point is that 7 over 700,000 people a year die of um reactions to prescription drugs unnecessary antibiotics um unnecessary medical procedures uh hospitalizations so that actually ranks number one so I guess the therapy the best therapy is to avoid doctors if you want to live longer um probably um you know the question is how many people actually died of vitamins uh in 2010 not one person in 2004 there was three people who died of Mega doses of vitamin d and vitamin E but I would there synthetic uh and of course that one person died as a result of overdose of iron and fluoride but I don fluoride a nutrient so there know by certain people to um pretty much make Alternative Care dangerous you know it quackery it scams but I personally think it way to camouflage like their own Secrets or or skeletons because the amount of medication that children nowadays uh even psych drugs that they soldiers and there single day in the military and that from the side effects from Psychiatric medication so I wanted to just share a story by a client she told me today she uh can you tell us what happened you you basically went to the doctor and you wanted some help and you started to um you had a whole list of problems because we other issues that you wanted to kind of evaluate can you just tell us a little bit about you walked in there and you saw the nurse and what what was the first thing that she said well um first I she asked me what I was there for so I said well I have a list of things and I had had some symptoms going on so I track of them and writing them all down and I started list listing them off to her and she looked at me like I was crazy and she said ma need to pick the top two because she not gonna have time to um to deal with all of those issues a little shocked yeah it it have a list of uh problems all those are connected they yes yes and that her I said no the doctor to listen to me because these are all connected and I need her to to help me figure out what is going on um so she left the room sort of hurriedly acting very like almost rude um but when the doctor came in I did make her sit there and listen to me with every single one of my symptoms because they are all connected like you and I spoke today yeah and so so one of the things that um what care um I mean look at this you got the top um cause of death is U over medicated patients unnecessary procedures what so specialized into um if you have a digestive problem you go to this doctor endocrine problem you go here but they I think um even with you you had uh I think you had some history of panic attacks or something or and they what did they what do they say about that um so I I talked to her about that and and told her that I have been having some panic attacks he basically said okay so here psychiatrist and I did go to the psychiatrists and they said okay well here remember what it was and you know um there there wasn why you might be going on it was well here this medicine go ahead and take it um so it was very disheartening and frustrating yeah yeah I know it it to evaluate to come up with some solutions um and then I think you eventually saw the doctor did he really what did he do did he say about you okay so so as I went through my list of symptoms he she it was it was a woman she says okay so you having um some panic attacks and and feeling like this so here referral to to go to see the psychiatrist and oh you flashes okay here to the gynecologist and oh you some joint pain here um oh in in your hip and and your back so here x-rays done um oh you constipation so take some Fiber thing you know what I it just she was treating each one of the things as um as a symptom as opposed to as opposed to looking at at everything that was going on that that there might be something happening um she just singled each of them out and sent me to other places and tried to treat each symptom individually yeah and that wanted to do this webinar just to give you guys some real basic things I mean even one thing with you with your hip I did some muscle testing I found out I asked you a question I said do you cross your leg a lot on one side and yes you do yes I mean you constantly do that and then that because you keep Crossing it and throws off the pelvis so um that some of these things are really really really um e obvious but the problem is um those are the sometimes hardest to identify so I wanted to get through um so I come back to that point but I want to just go through a couple things um about the third leading cause of death since we kind of protest getting old I don to get old uh I know it I want to slow it down um but it important to kind of know what people die of the third leading leading cause of death um after heart disease and cancer is psychiatric medications I didn looked that up um and this is um in the cancer in USA and Europe over a half a million people die of either um suicide or psychiatric medication that reactions to that I think that companies are being sued by the billions so there um with psychiatric drugs in the military um all over the place uh and then you have this guy Stephen Barret Beret whatever his name is on quackwatch which basically says he says most diseases have little nothing to do with diet it that it Placebo you know don vitamins you know alternative practitioners oversimplify he says when they say that Milling that removes the B vitamins they don to tell you the enrichment puts him back so you can see that here is a a person who is very anti-natural vitamins he which causes the third leading cause of death so it philosophy that I wanted to um teach you guys today is really going beyond the outside in going the inside out working on the inside of your body if you want to this the entire body to look youthful um I think probably the one of the biggest indust industries out there is skin care and makeup and hair care and it you tiny layer on the outside of your body um there is much better things to do to get the um the skin youthful prevent wrinkles and I need to do um a better strategy would be to just really look at the um the quality of materials that you in your mouth and you will say that um certain parts of your body are replaced at different rates for example um like your your skin cells sometimes are replaced every four days the liver is replaced every three years so the red blood cells are replaced every four months the colon cells are replaced every three days so you and the question is what are you replacing them with um I you the best material to replace them with but there uh rejuvenate or doesn itself and that kill off your brain cells you don replace them they don what I want to do is I want to ask everyone who webinar um a question what food and I going to just make this what is the food that gives us the highest nutrient value okay it I want you to go ahead and I at your answers right now I want you to take a while guess what category of food gives you the highest amount of nutrition out of all food categories I to answer that kale leafy greens vegetables kale veggies plants protein fats veggies protein okay well this is interesting because this is something that unknown um yeah berries no I always like that when you ask a qu I say um okay does anyone know this and you know they you you so um what about you do you have any idea what Leslie what what the highest nutrient food is on the planet that you can get all of your nutrition I should know this huh I um I I could be wrong all right let me I mean I reading all the things on the side everybody sure the one that one thing I what the one thing would be um okay so now I is I thought I had a slide on it but I don liver heart brains kidneys uh for personally um I can just I just can as a child I was forced to eat liver and I just can a hard time eating brains and kidneys but I Foods I know a lot of them are toxic because of the the animal feeds but I just telling you as far as the nutrients that um are in those foods like it it has all the nutrients but there is one food that has all the nutrients and that would be the organ Meats so if you like liver and you have an organic a free range you know animal um and you consume that it nutrition especially like iron and there is one type of uh nutrient um types of vit uh nutrients that are better for looking young young than others and that would be the fat cable vitamins and that would be like vitamin A d e k those vitamins yes they they previtamin so in other words they have to convert into the active form and you have to have a good digestive system to consume that so you may if you convert about 5% of those true fats Cy vitamins to help the division to the the skin even vitamin A for your skin if you don out your skin you and you actually look older uh going on a low-fat diet is very very bad for anti-aging um so let the the foods or the nutrients that will help you stay younger or look younger um the first thing I want to talk about is foods for collagen support what is collagen collagen is like the glue that holds the body together it the um it skin if you lose collagen your skin gets thin and it sags and you get wrinkles and you look older so you can consume the collagen itself or bone broth or grass-fed animal products but you also need trace minerals to actually utilize that collagen you also need Vitamin C um to use the collagen so uh I want to just show you something this is a grass-fed collagen that I got on line great leges gelatin I mean it it joint problems arthritis and you don consume a lot of animal products um especially grass-fed that would be something you can try and but I found that most people are not really deficient in collagen it that they they collagen I point is that uh it supplement to take but just by taking this doesn Skin several things to um to make that work work um the big thing is trace minerals the trace minerals are not in the soils um I here it plant-based minerals have are 50 15,000 times smaller than regular minerals so they they go in like a rocket ship so you need the minerals you also need the vitamin C complexes and I I wanted to show you um a food that in vitamin C but I want to First find out I want to ask you what foods are high in vitamin C what are the top three foods that are the highest in vitamin C let okay people are saying cam Camu yeah that kale spinach you guys are you guys are doing pretty good on that one so I think you got that one down the three foods are the highest in vitamin C which should be number one papaya number two kiwi and number three Peppers now these are not from the grocery store these are from the farmers market these are freaking amazing Peppers they they vitamin C you got to be careful about vitamin C because most of it is synthetic and I acid if you buy vitamin C and it has over 100 milligrams of of ascorbic acid acid it ascorbic acid from corn starch which has no vitamin C and sulfuric acid and you take this stuff you the vitamin C complex it help your collagen if you do something like this you complete complex because in the complete version of vitamin C you have enzymes a copper enzyme called tyrosines you have the J Factor the bioflavonoids the rutins all the different great complexes for vitamin C to help build collagen and organic copper it and so it the uh the uh vitamin C is stored in your adrenal glands so if the adrenal glands are tired you won vitamin C to use that and the other thing is that um when you take vitamin C in high dosages in synthetic versions it will create deficiencies of the other factors of vitamin C causing spider veins um and I in the next seminar but Linus polling recommend large dose of vitamin C you ever notice he has these spider veins around his nose that deficiency because one of the side effects of scurvy is micro Heming of the capillary blood beds and so this the bleeding gums the spongy gums that you have when you brush your teeth that vitamin C deficiency so um and also fatigue is a vitamin C deficiency um but but also the arteries the arteries can in high pressure areas have a micro hemorrage Hemorrhage and so the body puts a Band-Aid on it called cholesterol and calcium plaing and that the first thing that happens is the microage Hemorrhage from the vitamin C complex deficiency so those are some vitamin C um things that you you can look at and especially for your skin I mean you need that collagen um so now I slide if I can do a screen share let me see here okay so we have collagen bone broth if you took an or uh let bones from an um let something and it was grass-fed and you were to cook it uh over a day or two and and make some bone broth and there great recipe that would not be a bad idea to drink that stuff it good for collagen especially if you want really strong nails uh and hair um I can actually um if I can either use trace minerals to make hair stop falling out or sometimes collagen or the combination of both but because trace minerals also help the collagen form correctly so the combination is very very important especially for hair loss um so the mo most important thing to do is to make sure that your animal meats are grass-fed and um I um like here beef myself this is grassfed um and the reason why I do grass-fed is because it has loaded with vitamin K2 if you videos you basically um know about K2 it it improves elasticity of the arteries it decreases blood pressure it gets calcium out of the joints um it amazing and of course we have the grass-fed Cary gold butter it K it course I these are my eggs from the farmers market from a farmer that basically I have a video I going to put a video of this farmer because he has these cages in the grass field in the Clover fields and they like the human lawnmower they will eat all this grass and then he rotates them I mean talk about a pasture raised grass-fed chicken I mean those things are those eggs it the shell it it questions I want to just go right to the questions um said the webinar keeps cutting out no no uh worries I I done what about fermented cabbage I love it I think that vitamin I mean cabbage is is really huge in vitamin C and it has a complete complex uh can spider veins be repaired by taking proper amounts of vitamin C well I wouldn I would worry about the type of V SE that you consume and yes it can be reversed if you have the whole complex just make sure you do not consume ascorbic acid um let has some vitamin C but it sweet if you always have to talk about that because fruit tends to slow down weight loss okay good what what if you have autoimmune and can use the you know there great um vitamin C complex you can do that uh there that you can do other than the nitrates not a problem okay so there support one is you need you possibly might need collagen you might need um Trace minerals and you you might need to support your your stomach because if your stomach has um if you have like acid reflux or you have bloating or burping and you don that could be the reason why you can digest protein and collagen is your stomach has to be really really acid to to trigger those enzymes in the stomach to break down collagen so as you get older especially during menopause you lose your stomach acids so if I were trying to improve my collagen and I was female and I was menopausal the first thing I would do before anything is I would make sure that I correct um that digestive stomach pH so if I had like indigestion or acid reflex or heartburn that means that I would have to add more acid to that stomach to correct it so the valve gets closed it hydrochloride so if you and you have any digestive issues at all take some Bane hyd chloride maybe three with a meal get it from the Healy store and then within a week or two watch what happens to your hair nails and skin it will improve because you absorbing more of the collagen from the food you have to look at those factors the next thing I want to talk about is very important and this is for those people that um want to uh change the not just their health but the looking youthful and that would be the fat cble vitamins and all the oils um you don crazy you have to be able to digest them you need to um have a good gallbladder to digest them but the point is that when people are pushing the lowfat stuff that older you want to look at the shelf and get whole fat um not um lowfat anything so if you know make sure it you got to watch out for the sugars and yogurt nowadays um so there is not a problem using the butter it the skin because it contains vitamin A so the first vitam I that is in egg yolks grass-fed butter shrimp cheese sardines tuna it the fatty stuff I um going to show oh yeah cheese I Wisconsin so I love cheese and of course Cary gold here we go Cary gold butter Cary gold cheese this is my favorite cheese right here it believe it it another grass-fed cheese from Trader Joe of cheese that has the vitamin K it has the vitamin A even even some vitamin D those are fat cble vitamins that you need for your skin for your hair to prevent wrinkles um so those are things that really help you and take them from the inside don outside of your skin that do it I used to grave butter as a kid I used to eat it of course um I had no idea why now I know why I was deficient in vitamin A H so so vitamin A it these fattier type things that you were told to avoid so the other thing you can do is uh coconut oil you can cook with it you can eat it fish oils the best fish oil that you can have is either krill or cod liver oil yes your your grandmother was correct cod liver oil has a wonderful blend of vitamin A and vitamin D so don consuming just you don it you just need a little bit of it okay now let vitamin E important you E for scarring for skin health for sex hormon hormones vitamin E is a precursor for um hormones and it pituitary when women go through menopause um they don ovaries very much anymore so they going to have babies so what happens is that that Dynamic that pituitary release every month is no longer no longer has to work as hard so the vitamin E Reserve tends to dry up in a lot of women and I find they end up with a vitamin E deficiency and they start getting uh unnecessary wrinkles so I if I were you what I would do is I would don some of these fats but the foods that are highest in vitamin E are almonds other nuts sunflower seeds very high but they have to be raw sunflower seeds because when you cook them and you roast them you destroy the vitamin E because vitamin E is very sensitive to oxygen and Heat okay fat of your fish like hbit uh salmon uh shrimp sardines Lobster um and it greens the spinach CH charred kale it in eggs it so those are just some some common things of course vitamin D is the sun fish oils eggs cheese um but other than that let fish oils or eggs or cheese because you get much sun and you low vitamin D levels vitamin D is necessary for the Aging anti-aging process okay so what I want to double check just to make sure that there um I someone says they love sardines cow have if you not a problem I I other things you consume as well dandelion greens for vitamin A yeah well the the problem is the plant sources for Vitamin A they you 5% and that is the challenge that we deal with now I consume a lot of this kale okay I K I cut it I chop it up in my salad um so that vitamin pre vitamin A but it cruciferous vegetables have other nutrients we point is that you need to be eating them but you majority of your vitamin A from leafy greens because you only absorb 5% yeah I sorry okay let me just check these questions right here um um did you say BJs has good carry gold yes BJs does carry the carry gold in bulk so yes tuna is is fine I know there with Mercury um but I think um there actually going to do a video on tuna because there that are actually good and some tuna that is not good I complete video because I don get into a side thing on that right now fermented CER oil is the best um and you can get that online you can get it from Amazon I do take that it pretty good um I was given C liver oil when I was a kid lasted until Easter yeah it stuff um I found I sweat really bad without my vitamin D interesting graying of the hair mostly after exercise well that of the things that we is is stress so I then can you get enough vitamin D from foods you need supplement that good question I think you can maintain your body with just with with vitamin K2 foods but if you have high blood pressure stiffness you have tartter in the teeth soft tissue calcium you have arthritis or types of uh joint problems then you take extra and then once you get rid of that you can then maintain it after that so it is possible but not as a maintain maintaining thing okay now I want to show you something see if I can pop back over here now the accelerated aging of cortisol the hormone cortisol here new word um that I want to teach you is called um catabolism catabolism what does that mean catabolism catabolism is a breakdown of things it breaks down in the body um your body naturally uses the hormone cortisol to break down tissue but with the adrenal stress hormone being activated what happens is you get too much breakdown and not enough buildup so you get this overall catabolic effect that means a breakdown effect on the uh on the muscles specifically your thigh muscles in the quad group so when you get up from a seated position or from a chair it might be difficult to mount this um to get up also the the skin is very thin and almost paper-like and I with people I you can just see it very thin that excessive cortisol with stress and they have a disappearance of the elastic fibers and that brittle all the time as you age and that cortisol now I did a whole seminar on cortisol that was the last seminar I did and I talked about stress and if you did not see that webinar go ahead and watch it but I will give you some tips on stress right now because um I would say one of the biggest things that ages people is um stress specifically losses loss of a person love one loss of a job loss of a marriage threat of loss Financial threat of loss bad economy all that will add stress and so you do have to constantly work on reducing cortisol there nutritional things that I recommend for cortisol um I do recommend the adrenal day formula because it has a natural B1 in there that does not it nutritional yeast but it doesn you a yeast infection like some of the nutritional yeast out there and it synthetic like a lot of the nutritional yeasts are enriched with synthetic so if you did um a um that product and you take the that natural B1 with all the other things in it it to pull a lot of stress out of your body you feel very very calm and chilled out so B1 is necessary to rid stress from your body and you how do you know if you have a B1 deficiency there one you feel a lot of nervous tension in your body you just like you can you have a low tolerance to stress you have edema and swelling yes edema and swelling is a B1 deficiency many times as well um you have nightmares where very vivid dreams so if you have any of those we know it and stress will um cause that another thing you can do is get space go up for long walks um because stress tends to um inhibit your space and you get it outside and just get some space because that calms the adrenal gland down here just a picture of how proteins and different things can break down fat can break down sugars can break down it called catabolism and um just a breakdown okay we to uh cancer control because one of the things that um which is um processes dying early from cancer uh I mean there are people all around me that are dropping Dead with cancer patients patients relatives uh family members uh so it is a problem and there are things that we can do to um reduce the risk of cancer and I want to talk about that um let Define what cancer is cancer is a cell that is out of control it duplicating at a very fast rate and the question is why there machine in your body that is constantly keeping these extra cells that are radically growing out of proportion in check so there I apoptosis apoptosis and that that controlled cell death your body is killing between 50 and 70 billion cells every single day which they need to do that because they need to clean out all these you know mutated cells the cells that we need to get rid of so we can replace with the new cells so for an average trial between the ages of eight and 14 about 20 billion to 30 billion cells um die day so that now if we have if we if we cancer we want apoptosis to work correctly to kill that cancer so apoptosis is a mechanism that important defense against cancer okay so that talk about um so there destroy this mechanism and block the your body kill off these cells and there it and this slide is out of order um it want to just touch on this for a second what endocrine disruptor is any chemical in the body pesticide herbicides fungicides insecticides heavy metals country and western just want to see if you guys are awake that was a joke that was a dry sense of humor heavy metals country Wester this is a bad joke okay so endocrine disruptors are any chemicals in the environment that alter your genes and cause disease there this book it it toxicology it textbook of poisons okay the study of poisons and what poisons do with to the body um we are bathed in so many chemicals it yard to our food to the air we bathed in all these chemicals I mean there toxic chemicals released into our environment every single year and that 72 million pounds of recognized carcinogens which actually cause cancer so our bodies are constantly hit with these endocrine disruptors okay well guess what these endocrine disruptors um mess up the normal process of your body controlling cancer so you may have known that already but I your mind um I want to see if there real fast because um oh yeah someone mentioned Dees diethyl testerol here here uh was used in the uh 50s for morning sickness and I think over like millions of women were exposed to it and they caused problems not just in The Offspring but in the third generation it it really destroyed our bodies and they did not test the long-term effects of that very very similarly to what they doing now with the GMO Foods so they made a lot of money and then now um they banned it okay that Dees so DS is called an endocrine disruptor destroys your your your hormones okay so now this really amazing car called the cytochrome uh p450 now I joke but it sounds like a car doesn a p450 now a cytochrome p450 is an enzyme that has incredible capacities to turn those endocrine disruptors those poisons into harmless particles yeah so cytochrome po p450 enzymes are these special enzymes in your liver and they cells in your body that can break down thousands of chemicals toxins drugs and poisons and they basically just turn them into water soluble particles that can go through the urine and it just so happens that the cruciferous vegetables increase your liver this enzyme that so here it is right here insecticides pesticides go into the liver and your liver if you will basically dismantle those chemicals so your liver is like robust but if you have a fatty liver or it that virus or something then what happen is that you that break down how do you know if you have a fatty liver um a lot of people have it and they don the biggest Clues is is your stomach being too big and that visceral fat around the organs and especially the liver um I sent five of my patients to the radiologist to get an ultrasound of the liver and they all had guts and five out of five had a fatty liver so when you lose the capacity for liver you can get a lot more toxicity and what do you have to do if you have that condition you have to basically start consuming a lot of cruciferous and avoid the junk you need to get the junk out of the trunk all right so I just want to check the questions here Dr Berg isn of a function of minerals actually being in the soil before you can assume that they an animal that is eating yes well that why I really want to consume grass-fed animal uh products because are so are so bad now uh that we need to and you feed these animals uh corn and soy they not getting any nutrition from that at all and it at least if it not genetically modified and you have a lot more nutrition in the grass especially like Clover okay let okay the liver very important with with your skin if you really work on your liver and you start consuming a lot more of these cruciferous vegetables your skin will start to change and it and better and better uh especially with acne and dry skin and Youthful skin I mean the liver is really the Hub of all the um digestion of of your amino acids your proteins so we about cruciferous for a second let me just fix the slide here cruciferous what does this word mean Cru Cru which means cross it certain plants that have these little crosses in them okay and here cruciferous radishes Russel Sprouts kale cabbage Bak Choy and swiss chard mustard greens arugula now I have some other vegetables in here too um but I wanted just to mention the cruciferous family and this is this brings me to the next topic which is going to call um which is a different type of nutrient we talked about the fat Cal vitamins um but we now we need to talk about the other nutrient that will not just help your skin and all that but it will help post pone your life cruciferous was studied by the World Health Organization and it was found to um creates some serious anti-aging effects and anti-cancer effects on your body each type of food is Thoroughly tested to to um in decrease the risk factors of many different types of cancer so one type of cruciferous will maybe handle like several type of cancers another one will handle different other ones garlic is probably the top of the list that probably will that anti-cancer properties uh these are two different types of kale turmeric is a um an amazing um phytal nutrient it has phytonutrients I taric is kind of a root that has phytonutrients so the category of nutrients that we want to talk about next is called phytonutrients plant chemicals these are different than vitamins and minerals and amino acids they basically are natural plant chemicals that have extra Health factors and properties so they they degeneration prostate cancer many disease States and so the question is why are not why aren Foods I mean very few people consume these Foods here cabbage and celp celp is great for minerals and iodine um but these are the foods that I consume on a regular basis if you don consume them you need to start doing it for your liver and your skin will start to change as well even now these do not contain a lot of the fat soluble vitamins they do contain a lot of the phytonutrients which are anti-cancer and again the GMO Foods genetically modified foods are basically spreading all over the world right now and the two big ones are corn and soy and the animals that are consuming these are getting all sorts of inflammatory conditions and even the the pets that you have like even the dogs and the cats if you talk to a vet uh and these animals that come in with arthritis heart disease diabetes and inflammation in the gut uh it consuming GMO food when you just simply change the food non GMO these things clear up but 90% of all the GMO corn and soy go to animal feeds that in the grocery store that so-called natural chicken that you have from Purdue it organic it GMO now what is GMO GMO is um genetically modified organisms and what they do is they they actually have them resistant to theb side called uh Roundup Ready and so you can spray more of the Roundup Ready on these crops and so you bet they do that and it ready the chemical name is called glyphosate and glyphosate is um pretty nasty stuff but of course they say it safe so I think it might be okay um there researcher by the way that was just a sarcasm um sometimes people get my dry humor I don there studies animal studies and glyphosate and he found some serious problems with glyphosate um and I I going to send you the link too it says that GMO and glyphosate causes tumors liver and kidney damage in rats within a week a smear campaign was mounted by the biotech anology industry with Scientists primarily plant biologists and not toxicologists and they basically forced um the study to be extracted from um some of these journals so here the study comes out saying that GMO is bad and then it instantly was retracted not because they didn but their reasoning was it was inconclusive because the type of rats used were prone to tumor so now here that you know that how they powerful they are so powerful so um I mean you can this is totally political so the point is that you know the GMO food is pretty bad if you look at um from 1992 to 2012 you can see how many millions of pounds of um glyphosate is being put or GMO uh plants are being uh created and you can see Corn up soybeans is going up wheat actually some of the wheat is genetically modified cotton uh certain vegetables and fruit rice grapes alphalpha pasture and hay other crops oh my gosh it crazy so what happens is these chemicals GMO Foods herbicides they can mimic hormon and they go into um your glands the thyroid the ovary and it can go into the breast the uterus and cause cancer so if you take a look at like they always say that disease is so mysterious and it no one knows what causes this take a look at any of the toxicology books they will list all the diseases and tell you what pesticide or chemical causes this illness or this cancer and they don said um Leslie they they do not connect the dots they don with cancer and natural things it everything is like their own Island and so it these things uh that are related to the toxins and we we don not making the connection there um of course we have psychiatrist like Stephen Barret what name is pushing out there that oh no that was uh I just released a video I was on Sports Talk live and I had a dietitian and her husband who air and uh give me a hard time about the whole water myth so you can watch it on my website but um it was ridiculous they fine it has minerals keep drinking it everyone all right so let me just see next slide here okay the the hormones um like estrogen um from the environment and all these endocrine disruptors act like estrogen in the environment they actually block um the thyroid function so endocrine disruptors basically are chemicals that mimic estrogen and that get way way um too many cancers in the in the areas that they have receptors for estrogen which are breast uterus and even the thyroid um African-American women have a lot more receptors for estrogen which gives them a different shape and that even um African-American women are getting more cancers than other cultures because of the estrogen so you really need to um increase your cruciferous make sure you don make sure they because it it problem sooner or later so I just wanted to put this slide up I I hit it created you could see if you go down the grocery store and you see these incredible like delicious um cookies and donuts and breads um it High frous corn syrup hydrogenated oil chemicals High frus corn syrup artificial flavoring it thing pretty sad so phytonutrients those are plant-based chemicals that have all these really amazing properties and all these different plant chemicals that do many things like even vitamin A for example vitamin A is not a single vitamin it complexes like there vitamin A so if you take a synthetic vitamin a you are not even getting close to what you should get that very against synthetics um so crucifer vegetables help protect the cells from DNA damage they help inactivate carcinogens they antiviral antibacterial anti-inflammatory I mean they create all these wonderful benefits now I the questions here what do you think of um wild yam well if you um have a problem with um hot flashes with menopause I think that would be something you should take because that will it of um it phytoestrogens which are actually will help you there called the um the Clover Leaf that actually very good as well um let see okay how much difference will it take to take a cruciferous supplement um here thing it food but it is hard to get that so what I cruciferous product that a lot of you are already taking right now and of course you probably have not been taking because I but I wanted to explain um um kind of a combination of of ingredients that um I just talking but I this image here okay so you can see right here there it food and it has organic beetroot brussel sprouts uh collag green organic asparagus organic kale organic parsley and parsley is probably even has more vitamin uh vitamins and kale and then we have organic red radish cabbage garlic and turmeric so those are all the things that I personally think are the the superfoods and I put them in the in one combination there and this is something that is convenient if you don variety of nutrients because it is hard to get all these nutrients so like it has all these these products in there it has seelp because some people wig out because oh my gosh it cruciferous it deficiency of iodine for my thyroid I G to get a goer no you calp in there so it product and um and in these webinars I always give people a discount if you wanted to get some cruciferous um the bottle is 250 capsules and here I have some good news and some bad news what do you want to hear first the bad news or the good news let me see what you guys say there thing I want the good news or the bad news um bad news how about the good news how about the good news good news okay good the good news is that um I discount on this product $10 off and here link um and the good news is that it um it in yet it coming tomorrow morning so but the good news it in and I for this product because because here into um it is almost impossible to find a a local farmer or something in United States that has the soils that I want to get these products unless you go to China or you go to some other country I don forever and so what will happen this is March March see March April May June July August is it August or September September okay that haven tomorrow morning it morning for thing so what happened is I would get it would have like one ingredient tested would be it would have too much lead in it I that and next one would have like too much I don we don something like that so we had to thoroughly test every single ingredient and make sure that all really really high quality from the exact Farms that I wanted it from so it the good news it news is not quite here and so um there some more bad news um which um I the other bad news is that um the cost of this product went up severely so um I I have to increase it a little bit more it but the good news is if if you wanted to get the product at the lowest fee you can actually buy as many of these as you want with uh on this on this webinar so that to pay the bigger fee if you don so you can get some Reserve if you want um the only catch22 is that I only want you to order this tomorrow morning not tonight because I do not want to sell you this product unless I am 100% sure it available even though I tracking the the guy who up in my office he he tomorrow but until it shows up I gonna take I block off my website so in other words no one could really buy it until I actually have it in hand so if you wanted to check in early the morning and if it actually uh everything works then it then you know it want to let you know that um I really behind the scenes trying to get this thing out for a long time so so the good news is I there 99.99% chance and with the bad news is it little bit more expensive but the good news is you don because I so anyway this is a good product to take for your liver it because it it fortifies um the inside of the body and it also protects against a lot of different types of um conditions that um people are at risk just from the pollution in the environment so so now what I want to do is I want to give you a link and a code coupon code you can just highlight that coupon code and just um yeah just save it for tomorrow and you can go to my website and get a discount you can get as many as you want um I I will be increasing I mean the price is already increased but if you use that discount which is going to be good for the next three days I know it says the offer ends in one hour but that don worries on that okay now if you are watching this as a webinar replay just realize I already have it in okay because I sure um someone says can I piggy back on and auto ship order with my weat crass juice yes I think you could do that but you may want to call my office with that how long is the coupon offer for the next three days how long is the shelf life the shelf life is is good for a year but I think it than that but we we tell people a year at the because we conservative someone says don commercial I commercial don are asking me I discount um can you provide the price of the whole cerous food yeah um the price was 3$ 34.95 now it 39.95 um but there there um but the problem is that the uh the price trying to get these ingredients is just off the charts even if you go look for a cruciferous product it cruciferous and you may find them like in like broccoli or something like that but it it it good um program with with the quantity that you well do you ship to Canada yes do they lose any vitamins when they are processed um well you with the processing but if you keep them in the heat they and keep it open you may even want to keep it in the fridge to um have them last a lot longer what is the dose of how many pills per day it depends if you want a m maintenance dose I would take three but if you want to correct something you want want to take six personally this is just my own opinion if I had cancer I would take 15 a day I that just take them for weight loss but that uh the fat Rel on the liver and it allows the liver to function better which is really connected to actually the thyroid being working better so it doesn itself um what if you have a thyroid problem well we have seelp in there so you have the ey then that be a problem is it safe to take if you there ingredients can I give it to my toddler uh depends if he maybe one a day but of course if it baby you um unless he can swallow capsules yeah so um so anyway I I covered a lot of data a lot of information um I everyone a link to all these slides because I have a lot of references that you can see and I will send that out um probably a little bit later on probably in the middle of the night it to you and that way you can see the webinar I mean all the the slides and um and I if you want that but I want you to apply some of the information that I shared tonight and I want to thank Leslie for being on to sharing her story of the wonderful example of uh trying to get some help of treat being one person at a time or one condition at a time so thank thank you very much next Tuesday we seminar and this one energy and um it awesome I on insulin very heavily you need to you need to see that if you have any insulin problems and even even if you don if you if you are fatigued you need to come to this webinar as well um so I show you some techniques as well I going to show you uh an acupressure technique uh that will literally increase your energy yeah so I demonstrate it right in my office right here and then you could do it on your friends and family just don name now I that so I want to thank you guys for showing up tonight I um and I will see you next in the next webinar so I send you a link on that too and um I will um have someone reply to a lot of your questions because some people are um having specific questions about this and that so I go to my blog but I want to say thank you and have a great evening and thanks Leslie we welcome	Success
The Belly Fat Â Dr.Berg's Webinar	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXLSDfs3KlQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	all right welcome welcome to the webinar we weight in cortisol so the first thing I want to cover is that the weight in your midsection is very very different than other types of fat around your body so what we of hormonal fat and it hormone called cortisol there is another hormone involved it we fourth seminar so this seminar is all about cortisol and the effects that it creates on your body I using this reference book siba Encyclopedia of Endocrinology by Frank net and we data um it uh especially if you want to get rid of your fat so um without further Ado Let uh get started I screen saver to show you so we could yeah okay good so you can pretty much see that all right so what I want to talk about is um what is this cortisol thing okay the purpose of cortisol is to adapt adapt the body to stress for survival purposes so the purpose of the body is to survive but your adrenals tend to change the different functions to handle the environmental stress okay that are being chased by a tiger you could imagine you got pulse rate blood pressure blood to your muscles you have oxygen opening up in your lungs you have your your mental acut is very very um aware of everything you have more flow to the heart um all these things are um stress States so that would be one of the purposes of cortisol but I know a lot of people want to get rid of their cortisol because it fat but really you need this thing for survival uh mechanisms so we don it to be too low and we don be too high because there problems with low cholesterol as there are high cholesterol okay and if you have people that have symptoms of high cholesterol um and low cholesterol mixed um you know you try to do research on that and you won data and I have my theories because you have these people that present with like for example belly fat but they showing symtoms of a low cortisol not a high cortisol why is that like they might have allergies or high blood pressure or they might have inflammation or itching or acid reflux well I think what cortisol is too high in the beginning and then it tries to connect to a receptor like in a different like all these hormones connect to different body parts and they they plug into these little tiny receptors kind of like a like information goes into your ear well if that cortisol that stress hormone is too high it will cause the receptor to adapt and downgrade very similar to insulin being resistant because there too much insulin and your body just adapts and it just won insulin so so I think you have this thing called cortisol resistance it it the only thing that makes sense so when you have a situation where you have high levels of stress over a period of time sustained stress all these receptors downgrade and now we have symptoms of high cortisol and symptoms of low cortisol not a good situation so the cortisol is produced uh from a gland on top of your kidney there tiny glands that sit on top of the kidney right in the central part of your body and these glands take a beating they are going to uh send messages through the body to handle the amount of stress so it keeps the body alive now the interesting thing about the adrenal is that it has two parts an inside and an outside the outside is just all gland tissue and that but the inside of the gland is all nerve tissue is it weird isn of the nervous system that autonomic nervous system it word uh the or you know it like the system that works on automatic you don call autonomic you can call automatic but it and and that system inside the adrenal that um makes neurotransmitters now what is a neurotransmitter it that travels through the nervous system so here we have hormones that travel through the blood and they communication um particles that travel through the blood but then you have communications that travel through the nervous system so you have two ways that the adrenal can communicate through the nerves and the blood so it really inates every single part of your body um there is um a device that can measure the autonomic nervous system and you can get Clues on what adrenal and I have that device and I going to talk about it in a second but I want to explain this autonomic nervous system thing okay it its purpose is to help balance um the inside of the body all the different functions and keep keep it um regulated properly so it adapts to the environment to keep the inside of the body at a c a c a certain constant state they call that homeostasis where your body is trying to balance itself out so you have like all these things that speed up and turn on and then you have all these parts of the body that can turn off and one part of the system of the autonomic nervous system is called the sympathetic division that all the flight or fight that would be um like if you you reactions um come out of this autonomic nervous system like it circuits they come out of your if you look at where it in your middle back of the spinal column so that and cause different reactions that turn on but look at over here we have the opposite division the off switch we call that call that the parasympathetic Division and that turns things off and look where that comes out of that comes out of the top of the neck we remember the on switches are on the midback and the off switches in the top of the neck okay but there thing and I know it so there there this on switch to the adrenal gland right here but if we look over here on the off switches there is no connection to the adrenal with the off switch so the adrenal doesn off switch which explains a lot it this explains why people can you have people that are under sustained stress for many years and they get maybe they retire and they or they go on vacation or they go to bed at night and they try to go to sleep and their body will not shut off so the accumulation of stress builds up and it can get stuck in the body and it can cause um you to be on 247 especially with your head it just going going going going going it can so the nature of the adrenal is survival so what that a survival mode where you solving problems your attention is on bringing problems up solving them constantly and when it gets even it gets to the extreme where you find that your body gets stuck in that you you lose your tolerance for stress so things start to get to you especially anything that opposite of Lo being logical competent sane order so you tolerance to any incompetency outof order situation slow you just won and that adrenal overload because the person can feel subjectively that they highly critical and that personality that affecting their personality I mean how many relationships are affected by having the adrenal overload where the person just is just like back and forth back and forth no patience I mean it can get so bad you clock is ticking and you just can stand that I mean it go to sleep with a with the TV white noise to kind of filter out stuff but they all the time um and so that problems with the adrenal is that it can create a cognitive effect U that is very desirable okay so let want to show you this right here all right so so does that make sense we have the autonomic nervous system we have the the part of the autonomic nervous system that turns things on it then you have the other part that they call that rest and digest it called the parasympathetics that and it connection to that adrenal so there is no off switch fascinating okay so let talk about can the adrenal glands or let part of the adrenal gland generally speaking to see what going on yes you can there technology out there called heart rate variability and I don the Tech U the technical aspects of this but it measures the that part of the nervous system and it measures two things one is stress States it measures accumulative stress and it also measures recovery or that that turnoff switch so it measures the on switch and the off switch okay now the on switch or the the flight or fight is this long right here and it should be normally straight up and down Plum not too stress not too burnt out and then the off switcher the recovery mechanism should always be twice as high because you need a buffer if you are being chased by a tiger in the wilderness you need some Reserve to get away you can because or else you would stand up and pass out so you need a good nice robust recovery mechanism to handle stress now let this tall dial let is too high remember it should be straight up and down this person is pretty jacked up on the inside of their body and they stressed out but look at this person might not feel too bad because their recovery dial is so high that the The Brak pads so they pedal but they have good braks to handle it so this person is in a state of um they it burns out okay so they problems sleeping and excessive thinking that type of thing now if we get down over here we have that not too bad with the tall dial okay so there may being a little bit of flat fight but look at this recovery it this person is really not doing good because recovery is necessary for metabolism for sleep for handling stress and for the heart to handle exercise so this person should not be exercising any high intensity because they feel dizzy they might have uh stress on the heart uh it take them a long time to recover and there active recovery so it them from getting into the deep sleep they tolerant to stress so I just wanted to kind of show you what these two mean because you can kind of visualize not just subjectively feeling stress but you could see the stress the accumulated stress so both of these people here if you go into their history I always ask two vital questions that you should always focus on if you have any problems and you want to solve your problem is find out like when did you start having this problem when did you start gaining weight in midsection what happened just before that there will always always be something that triggered it and you know sometimes you ask the doctor and they go oh no um you know I know you started having projectile vomiting when I gave you those medications but that couldn be it I mean it you took the medication you vomited okay so this is like the obvious thing what happened right before it and you going to get Clues as to your adrenal stress your belly fat um I mean I had one lady um and she had this itching in her body almost like a yeast infection and I said when did you get that she told me it was like a I think it was like three weeks ago I said what did you do just before that and she just she couldn anything and so I just told her I just started asking her I said well did you have antibiotics she goes no I said did you take any nutritional yeast she goes oh my gosh yes I did I said ding ding ding so because sometimes when you get the wrong type of nutritional yeast um which is a supplement for people um it can create some yeast issues if you take too much okay so anyway that example of of you know finding out what the cause of something is okay so now the next thing we stress um stress is a little bit different for a lot of people um but typically people get stressed out from physical stress injury surgery uh change of environment change of diet um being in a bad marriage being in a b having a bad job um but out of all the stresses that I that I observe people go through I think the biggest thing that I see is stress with other people wouldn we can pretty much just take people and to put them in two boxes number one the people that bring you up and number two the people that bring you down okay um the the people that you they stress you out um and you connected to them you to either improve the situation or not be around them because all day long I constantly trying to help people change their environment and it just boils down to being in this this situation where they could even be a family member but what happening is that this family member is being so destructive that don because their family and blah blah blah so I want to just explain one personality type that I think you could identify with it aggressive this is the person that told you they stood up for you but they actually ruined your reputation they they will say to you uh like a nice comment like um hey I like your hair was it did you get it at cheap cuts you know your haircut a cheap really how who would ever say that or that sale like it kind of a destructive comment so they very degrading but they nice way they say are you feeling okay you look a little bit tired I had this person say to me once um hey congratulations you graduated from chiropratic college hey why didn she want to become a real doctor so that something that you probably wouldn but um it a seminar one day and had all these people sitting here and this lady raises her hand and she just Smiles at me and she says Dr Burke um we love you but how do we know that you I rude um first of all how do we like who there so sometimes people um are very very um destructive covertly and those are the people that you need to avoid like the plague um they will mess with your adrenals guaranteed okay now I talked a little bit about tolerance of stress but as the adrenal glands get weaker and weaker you lose your patience you lose your tolerance you fly off the handle easily you don freeway you don incompetent people that make mistakes you walk in a room you thing that your tension goes on it uh more because your body your mind is fixated on problems 247 so even if you had a wonderful day you that wasn be happy because your attention is just so stuck in these issues so that an example of an adrenal issue and if we measure that on that graph that dial the low dial will be all the way to the left okay so there cortisol that I want to talk about because um I mean this virtually blows my mind how many issues can occur from the adrenal um so I this in this book called CBA it encyclopedia on endocrine system medical illustrations by Frank net MD this is in pretty much all the medical uh schools um but check it can cause belly fat diabetes muscle at Fe in fact let me just show you a page page 84 right in this book and I book it send you the slides um but here a problem with high cholesterol the adrenals are very destructive on protein so it your collagen and it will turn that into fat you can pretty much see it on this graph you see this lady with these skinny legs and the big belly well the adrenals will start taking proteins from the thigh muscle and converting them into sugar and then fat into the belly because the body is in the state where it thinks it starving regardless of the all you can eat buffet down the street it just thinks it depletes this it muscles and turn that into belly it very destructive so proteins collagen joints fall apart High cholesterol cholesterol will go high because cholesterol is needed to build adrenal hormones low vitamin D levels wow um immune system the white blood cell which protects you against infections are all controlled by the adrenal that hormones in the form of cortisone or hydrocortisone or steroids or prazone for pretty much all really infections so if you look at what conditions someone would take prazone or a steroid or cortisol 4 you can get an idea of the function of cortisol it anti-inflammatory they give it to allergies heart conditions coronary problems immune problems and the big one autoimmune problems we in a little bit but um on this page in the bottom it talks about viruses coming out of remission with with high levels of cortisol I mean it mind how many issues that people have and it these separately they the root issue um yeah allergies asthma inflammation arthritis btis tontis excessive brain activity um acid reflux diabetes hypoglycemia other than that it won affect anything I poor wound healing buffalo hump in the back round face red uh cheeks that rosacea moon face belly fat high blood pressure insomnia sleep apnea oh my gosh it goes on and on and on okay so those are all the symptoms of the adrenal craving for salt chocolate and even sugar so um the adrenal gland has a lot of effects and um a lot of people have a few of the effects but not all of them it might gradually get more and more and more so when you go to the doctor they rarely check for cortisol and the problem is that if you get one test that measures your cortisol it doesn cortisol works on a circadian wave through the day and night you really to measure this correctly you measure it every four hours throughout a 24-hour cycle to get a better impression and I believe that saliva is one of the a good ways to do that but here thing when they even if you test positive you would have to have the majority of these symptoms before someone does something about it um like the doctor and they only use a drug and a compassionate basis so really they don in this book right here um but there some other things that I want to show you because there condition called it showed you all the symptoms for high adrenal remember you could be a mixed but check this out this person loses weight they get atrophied they shrink and they get tanned waight and you get tan okay you might like that right but it probably hear people that go through stress and lose weight That healthy but this person has um verigo that losing the pigment um their immune system is completely destroyed and they have a lot of inflammation jonath Kennedy had this condition called aisin which is low adrenal and they have to be injected by with adrenal hormones so a lot of autoimmune issues so the adrenals can also affect um bruising um and Mal pattern baldness facial hair I mean acne I mean think about how many people have these conditions and so it have this one gland that affects so many issues and it stress so stress is a huge culprit in um destroying our lives and our health and especially with weight loss um a lot of people are on a diet and exercise well you can get some changes with diet and exercise but there other things that you need to know about to help your belly fat that go beyond diet and exercise that very few people are talking about we that all right so I covered the effects of cortisol okay stress accumulates pregnancy hysterectomy tonsilectomy infections see when you were a kid um you may had your tonsils out you had respiratory infections you had sore throats um and now you you might think well that it all that stuff does affect your adrenals it number of applications on your desktop computer like right here all these applications on your desktop can slow down the computer it the exact same thing with the adrenal it stress and U physical mental emotional the people that I talk to that have never really experienced that much stress they always can lose weight easily and they don health problems it connection so um personally I probably more injuries and infections than any patient that ever came to my office my whole life I had sore throats tonsil issues lung issues digestive issues sleep issues uh arthritis inflammation energy chronic fatigue issues uh I my arm my elbow um I head whiplashes motorcycle accidents um wrestling injuries and fractures fractured my neck several times so um all that stress accumulates and that what drove me to figuring out some of this stuff because I personally had a lot of these problems um okay so visceral fat um visceral fat is a different type of fat it fat around the liver it superficial and it can be measured and that so so um the question is how do you lower cortisol you don you want to balance cortisol by lowering the um the um the impression that it left on the body cortisol well let me just get into that in a second I wanted to touch on this next slide here first and then I into what to do about it auto I want to talk about autoimmune conditions um a lot of people have them Loop rheumatoid Ms um you name it there autoimmune conditions and uh there lot of theories out there and what causes them um well I you right now my theory on this um is that I think that um autoimmune diseases um are related to the adrenal and the reason I say that is because you can take any autoimmune case 100% of that and ask them when did it start and what happened just before that and there is always some stress event that occurred right before the autoimmune condition whether a loss of a loved one which by the way losses will affect the adrenal a thousand times more deadly Than Physical trauma divorce loss of a loved one multiple losses I mean the problem is everyone is around people that eventually they these people So eventually they to have adrenal issues it matter of time I my family very few people have died one person very close to me my grandmother but that that autoimmune cases always have this huge stress usually a loss right before it so that means that the adrenal gland is involved okay so what I want to show you next is um there showare with you and this data is uh has to do with um another interesting finding with autoimmune cases okay this is the research has B been been done on um this guy by the name of Marshall called the Marshall Protocol and here Simplicity of it he found that um or not he just he just observe this and he connecting the dots he found that um the vitamin D is heavily um influenced with autoimmune and immunity so in other words vitamin D is uh intimately connected with your immune system and he found that the vitamin D receptor is inside the cell and the difference between vitamin D and other vitamins is it vitamin that in can go inside the cell more than a water salable vitamin so it goes deep down into uh the DNA of a cell and what that the receptor for vitamin D um called the vitamin D receptor vdr gets blocked and then you can vitamin D anymore okay and then the person has this Associated finding with um autoimmune and this is what he does he he gives someone a vitamin D receptor vdr analog here explain what it means I analog is something that kind of mimics something so it acts like something so a vdr analog would be something that could help open up the receptor so it can it can help mimic um and open up the receptor okay so what he found is that there is high blood pressure medication that is a um it some type of Remedy that helps reverse the um receptor problem the the block receptor okay allowing vitamin D to go in there and helping the autoimmune system and I don because it heavy duty antibiotics for a long period of time I think it year so it it interesting is the vitam D um does get blocked so now let book right here Frank net page 84 and right here cortisol counters vitamin D levels it blocks vitamin D I don see that so in other words the question is why does vitamin D get blocked in the first place Marshall talks that it does it and that but what about the adrenal because it a stress adrenal is the thing that triggers the whole event because it stress event now if you do a search on the vitamin D receptor analoges and I know I just hang it hang tight there is another thing that I think is very natural um that um can act to help open up this vitamin D receptor and uh I I stumbled on it and you can use bile salts yeah from the gallbladder purified bio salts do help open up that vitamin D so you can absorb more vitamin D at the receptor level which is fascinating because that doing research not benar because it there bile helps you break down the fat cable vitamin vitamin D helping you your immune system so I just found that kind of an interesting connection and I wanted to bring that up if there anyone listening that has autoimmune you should research using bile in your diet and um vitamin D together to see if that can help you on in addition to also looking at um what you can do to improve the adrenal function overall I just want to make make a disclaimer here that I claiming to cure any adrenal diseases okay okay I I information so you can do research and you can know where to focus on and get with your doctor to help yourself okay so that disclaimer all right so check this out you guys heard of Roundup Roundup Ready Monsanto GMO right it they used on GMO to be able to it because GMO is like they made it resistant to round up ready an herbicide so it just found in this toxicology reports that there Ready creates a major problem to the adrenal gland yeah interesting it disrupts the endocrine system of the adrenal gland in male Rats of course I don what do you think but I just want to bring that up because in this stuff came came out in 1996 which is date coincidence to a lot of people getting sick shortly after that so I connection to a lot of adrenal issues from people consuming genetically modified food without even knowing it and that would be um uh in all the soy and the corn but also in the animal products that eat the soy in the corn which is huge it place okay so now I about some tips to reduce stress all right because what we want to do is we want to you know not take a just a pill to low Coro we want to look at the whole body we want to find out what to eat of course we want to find some way to deal with this issue and so there things that you can do overall because yes we want to correct the problem but we also want to correct um your environment and so it doesn and on and on and on um so there are techniques that you can extract stress from the body I injuries but what happens with the adrenal is that it it creates a lot of situations where you lot you I mean here you are at work in front of a computer right now you computer and then you go to bed but there with stress what stress does is it kind of it why when you say I need some space because you don have space so one of the remedies for stress is to get space so how do you get Space go outside go hiking go in a park get lots of space go to the beach all this is very therapeutic you might say it the sun it so going to a gym behind a treadmill looking at the computer screen is very very bad um I you on something and maybe your meditation is something different but that some people that do it told me but and it works for them but the point is that if you were to extrovert your body and not focus on any but just observe things in your environment you know temperature sight sounds without analyzing everything that would be very therapeutic if you did that every single day because all day long you work we have to reverse that and extrovert your body for your stress okay so that space another thing let here more sleep now some people have a problem sleeping I had a problem sleeping really bad and so one of the common remedies for um helping with the adrenal and stress is to get more sleep so now let how do you fix sleep first of all sleep there sleep problems you can have hot flashes for example you can have problems with stress that you can you have a problem where you sleep for two hours and wake up at 2 or three in the morning and you Bright awake yet during the day at 2 or three you because you rhythms are off so what I like to do is I like to make sure the eating is right so there nothing interfering um I also recommend doing various treatments either go to a doctor that I train come to my office or if you version of do yourself version of this technique which is an acupressure technique and I couple techniques um I I do acupressure on myself every night before go to sleep my practitioners work on me as well uh of course all the injuries I right but there show you a lot of you um watching this have this tool already it acupressure tool it has three widths so it I use the widest one and we work right back here so now what I you sleep that will really blow your way okay let me see if I could find the image here okay what I wanted to show you is that you remember when we showed you at the beginning of the webinar um the sympathetics the the on switch and then the parasympathetic the off switch and the off switch basically is in the brain stem up here in the top of the nerves and the top of the the neck right here well the name of that nerve is called the veg nerve okay that and it comes from the Latin word which means wandering because it travels all the way up to your um up to your neck down to your um your organs let me just quickly just go back over that because I this is important I want to show you something yeah right here you see this nerve coming out it goes all the way to the face the lungs the heart the stomach the pancreas the liver the intestines goes all into these organs right here right so check this out where am I here okay so there is a there is a treatment nowadays it stimulates the Vegas nerve and uh it stimulation and I just want to let you know I disagree with this treatment and I because it nerve and there if you if you use this technique there a much easier way to stimulate the nerve without having to send electricity some shock wave through your nervous system but look at the FDA even approved it for for um depression and epilepsy but it also used for anxiety and stress and Alzheimer malen even obesity why would it be used for obesity because the veg nerve is the turnoff switch it relaxes the body it increases recovery and it helps lower cortisol okay ttis it this atrial fibrillation autism bulimia chronic heart failure hiccups coronary heart disease why would it be used for all these things because it can it can orans it connects to the organs so they electrical stimulation to this but here you can do and I don people realize what this is doing when you do this technique um they built entire chiropratic techniques around adjusting the first cervical vertebrae in your neck okay called the hole in one the atlas um why because creates such effects on the rest of the body with relaxation so the technique I develop I use my hands and I get in there so but lot of times if I there so I built this after my hand on I mean modeled after my hand it width of my hand but look at how big my thumbs are right I have huge thumbs and that what I do is you put this in the back of your couch or a tall back chair and you kick back your feet and you just lean back and you let this thing connect right underneath your skull and you let gravity pull you back and you can push your head back and relax guarantee if you did that for two minutes you why because it stimulates the vagus nerve naturally it relaxes all the neck muscles it helps the nervous system which is the off switch this is turning on the off switch which will then turn off the cortisol because it will affect that flat or fight mechanism so so yes there are techniques out there to turn off the on switch but this is like triggering the off switch okay so we do both we work on both now the other technique I can because I do it in my bed and I should have to create a video on that but you use this on your back that middle back part like from your upper back down to lower part you can use this because you would use this part right here to hit all the way down your spine one and you just let gravity and you lay back on your bed and you work on that that what I do every single night and I go to sleep right after that um my wife are you always going to be using that thing why don right but I have to do my back first right so that is something that a lot of You Are already have but if you don have it I highly recommend you get one um okay so now uh let me go back to my slides here okay so so I just wanted to show you that there is a vagus nerve stimulation thing I don but that there that you can do you can work on the adrenal glands you can work on the midback you can work on the tissues in the front these are all the points that I use to extract stress from the body okay and what am I doing is I using this to put myself in the Delta Way sleep so acupressure is a really good way to help someone sleep to get better sleep to get deeper sleep and turn the body off so when you go to bed every part of your body can finally turn off okay so we talked about space we talked about sleep let being too serious okay there want to teach you it which means insucient this means Carefree nonserious untroubled unworried okay let me just so I can talk to you about this the adrenal cases put you in a state where you days you get really really serious anytime you increase stress on your body a good way to reduce that would be to be a very in suan you fact I would write that on some paper and put on your refrigerator and be very Carefree about things go through the day and just be light joking but not degrading but just very very playful um that Viewpoint and attitude is the best Viewpoint to reduce stress the people that have the hardest time with losing weight are the most serious people people they calories and they they lady comes in and she because she she working and I can see she about everything so I said this is this is what I want you to do I want you to promise me for one week and I started I explain the definition of sueny Carefree I want you to do this for one freaking week okay I want you to stop being so darn serious I want you to stop weighing yourself I want you to have fun I want you not to care about your weight just do the eating plan do the things I say and don it 247 why because all that worry is triggering the adrenals adrenals think way too much they all that just stirs up the adrenal 247 so again we have to extract the stress we have to have the attitude of being ins suan and carefree uh do something get involved in some games games is a very great way to be insucient and playful don news before bed watch okay something like that so insian is a a playful caring non u i mean Carefree way to go about life the people that I know that are the most successful are the most ins okay so that three okay now we potassium there little Point here all right so got my little book right here page 84 as you know I this is like a hobby for me I love Endocrinology that study 247 weekends I like aren books I you think anyone else is but um there is one thing on this page that talks about potassium deficiencies so with adrenal you lose potassium not to mention you probably don because if you watched any of my videos you you require 4700 milligrams of potassium every single day 4700 one banana is three 100 You or 11 bananas so here I make potassium is a physiological tranquilizer it nervous system without pottassium your nervous system can out it rate and even blood pressure if you deficient in potassium your pulse rate goes up try to sleep with your pulse rate in the 90s it doesn it will help calm you down so what food is high in potassium vegetables so there we we a lot of pottassium to calm those adrenals down so you need huge salads twice a day lunch and dinner no fail just stick it in there see vegetables don they have the vitamin C complex that you need see most of the vitamin C in your body is stored in the adrenals and uh most the vitamin C that people buy is synthetic so you in ascorbic acid and high dosages will create a vitamin C deficiency because it the good parts of the vitamin C complex so what what you need to get is a food based vitamin C or just the food itself if you eat that much vegetable like maybe hu two huge salads a day or plates of vegetable before you have the protein you will have all the V Vin C that you need um another thing that vitamin C deficiencies will will um show up is pink bleeding gums loss of collagen so we talked about in the um seminar on nutrient absorption we talked about having an acid stomach to digest collagen but now you need Vitamin C to build collagen um so that family okay so we need the potassium and we need the vitamin C um potassium is in avocados so one avocado is 800 so I have like probably half an avocado every other day but I do a lot of salads I go to the farmers market and I get my lettuce and I always cut red cabbage and I stick a little kale in there I like the Dinosaur Kale and I will do that every single day if I don not as good as it should be okay now when you eat a lot of protein that stimulates your body but you need the vegetables to counter the body counter that that reved up um protein uh action all right so now the next thing we about is B1 okay so B1 vitamin B1 is the magical vitamin for stress but there things you need to know about it number one The more stress that you go through the more B1 that you burn up B1 is necessary for um your nervous system if you vitamin B1 um you will have a condition called berry berry and I right now now so you can so I can just show you the actual name of this of this condition that affects the psyche let me see yeah look at this when you deficient Barry bar you get um um this condition where you have neurological and psychiatric symptoms yeah depression severe anxiety Doom and Gloom wow yeah so if you ever want to see all the symptoms you can look up U berry berry but um you can look that up later but here B1 most of the time is made synthetically so you have to find a natural B1 now it not um it like to get my B1 one um in nutritional yeast the problem is most nutritional yeast is made synthetically it enriched synthetically with B1 so you need to get an enriched yeast that has this enriched with synthetics and um there is one product that I do have it formula okay and I have in here a natural B1 but I also have the entire vitamin C complex that the adrenal needs and all the minerals that the adrenal needs needs and a several herbal things with the adrenal needs but this is interesting because when you take this within I would say about five minutes maybe less you going to feel like just the stress just kind of goes right away this is a great thing to take if you have that nervous tension buildup that you explode if you have people around you that have that just slip one of those in their coffee and they to you so the people that are hypercritical the people that are have low tolerance to stress take three of these take nine of these a day but I think three would be fine Sprout through the day but take it as needed and you feel a change because it affects the nervous system it pulls stress out you you know it when I when I don week I stress and then I because I I I run my body and I I do all sorts of exercise stressful things and so I naturally comes from wheat grain but not the type of grain that you get from the grocery store if you were to grind your grain and eat the grain right away it might be a problem for your weight but it has all the B complexes B1 so I don eat grains so I need to get my grains from something so the adrenal day formula is the stress formula for the adrenal it has the B1 in there it has all the be complex and it comes from a type of nutritional yeast that unfortified and it doesn the yeast effect that will cause the yeast infection so it stress relieving product that helps uh with stress and energy and focus and um also nightmares when you B1 you get nightmares and heavy Vivid dreaming so that would be indication that you need that as well okay so B1 is very very necessary for any type of stress events or stress symptoms or um any psychiatric problem a nation be giving B1 um you know they label people with ADD and attention deficit disorder and schizophrenia and bipolar it it and adrenal stress that okay um now there for sleep and I use this I developed this formula for myself I take one before bed sometimes I you just need one for bet it formula this formula has been changed many many times and I perfected it to the point where you get the optimum wonderful sleep where you just turn off go to sleep for seven hours and you wake up feel refreshed you don but it really helps people sleep it very popular thing so I take one of these and I take three of these through the day it want to find something that helps you naturally sleep but this is not treating cortisol this is supporting a healthy adrenal and it helps you sleep through the whole night so you can rejuvenate so the the effects that you get from the sleep help rejuvenate cortisol but this helps you sleep okay so that combination that I would recommend all right so now let me go back to this for a second all right so there this massage tool that shows you all of the different techniques um that you can use but it also if you even go to this uh my U website drberg.com massage hyphen tool hyphen manual um you can watch videos on how to do the technique you need the device but at least you could see the the the technique and you can probably do a few of them to help yourself um tonight when you go to sleep or today um okay so here are some different things we talked about the turnoff switch the vas nerve now we eating plan now in previous seminars I talked about ketosis um ketosis is your body burning fat but the problem is if you adrenal type there ketosis because the problem with the adrenal is that adrenal puts your body in a state of um making new sugar it basically converts your protein to your sugar the name of that is called gluconeogenesis which is basically sugar new making of making new sugar that what it means so with doing an eating plan with the adrenal you have to make sure you have enough protein if your body is breaking down protein if you go on a low protein diet or a vegetarian diet with adrenal your body will have a tendency to eat up your own proteins and that you muscles get weaker so we always need to make sure that we have at least some protein with each meal okay the next thing that the adrenal uh case needs is or what doesn sugars they cannot do sugar why because their body sugar as it is and so we got to put them in a state where there talked about that in the ketosis webinar it protein and plenty and plenty of P potassium food that okay now here talk about and the problem with ketosis uh the meal plan is is this you know ketosis allows you to have a lot of fat the problem if you adrenal type and your metabolism is slow is that when you check the urine you may be in fat burning no doubt but the fat that you your body it eating it we don in high quantities because we want to strength your body so with adrenal cases they can do a modified ketosis diet but they have to increase a lot more vegetables with potassium keep the sugars down but the amount of fat that they can eat is somewhere between moderate and low okay not extremely low but they can amounts of you know fatty things because they just need to um be able to burn their own fat and so that is the the The Twist on that ketosis diet so I like to start out with a little more fat and then slowly decrease it until you burning your own fat and you will know that when you the ketosis diet and you ketosis and you then we know you that you gaining weight but we want you to lose weight okay so that clarification on the adrenal eating plan now the other point I want to make on is the U Paleo Diet paleo dad really good but for adrenal cases um I found that you can berry and it restrictive but listen you may have 20 or 30 pounds to lose in your belly or 10 pounds of fat or maybe five pounds it type of fat it with traditional balanced diets and I that kind of goes against my philosophy and I think it doesn it but it might a little bit uh you know I talk about get healthy to lose weight not lose weight to get healthy um on some of the adrenal cases you can a so-called healthy diet where it can be healthy but it of as healthy see people think of healthy diets is oh you can do fruits and berries and whole grains no no no no the type of eating plan that you need for the adrenal would be some fat just a little bit lower okay not low fat but between moderate and low you need high potassium foods you need a moderate amount of protein not too much and you want to make sure you have zero sugars that will help you but you to also pull out this stress now I I have a chart here and I going to you look at the bottom of this um video you slides so you can kind of study this and you can have all these slides but here the diet that um I recommend for the adrenal now this is the kale Shake I Chang the recipe for the kale Shake I no longer recommending berries if you an adrenal but if you have a high metabolism or or let male body and you could probably do fruit you can do Paleo you can do higher fat you will still lose weight but I those people I menopausal woman that is struggling they need to be a little bit stripped on this so I be eating the kale is just a way to get the kale in your body um we used to recommend putting a combination of a handful of kale and berries and water now I recommending put the kale on there put the stevia Berry flavored liquid Stevia okay it of sweet and you can drink it down as a shake if you want to get if you want to drink your um your salad okay for breakfast it you must have a protein breakfast a protein in some fat whether it cheese avocado chunks maybe a burger patty here are all really good breakfast foods and if you consume the protein for breakfast it will stabilize your blood sugars in the evening one of the triggers for cortisol is a low blood sugar hypoglycemia so just by if you skip breakfast or you eat the wrong thing for breakfast you cortisol in the evening so I you what you should do to keep the cortisol level in check for lunch we do the big salad we do a little bit of protein fish shrimp Seafood chicken don we okay for dinner do the same thing do some vegetable dish with some protein if you within 48 hours to to one week to possibly a little longer than one week if you do this and you the sugars your body will start to convert its enzymes its machinery for burning fat so it takes a while to get into fat burning okay um but it will burn fat and you won crave as much okay now as a little snack in the evening you could do a little hummus with cucumbers or celery a little cheese a little bit of nuts don crazy with the nuts I think people eat way too many nuts and too much peanut butter as a snack because it does have a little bit of carb and then we got the celery with the peanut butter little cheese and this is a keto bomb I have these recipes on my website um but those are some things that you can do to keep it really really simple um a couple points with the keto bombs um they they fatting only take them as as needed um so don that small batches so you don around but they sugar so but if you do this you won crave sugar your sugar Cravings will go away very fast okay so that is what you eating okay so we have the adrenal night formula and the day formula on my

The \"OTHER\" Reasons Why People Can't Lose Weight Â Dr.Berg on Weight Loss Barriers	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0st9k3bNAi0	Dr. Eric Berg DC	okay so now we another strategy that we in helping you uh of course you started the you plan but there realize if you there are other things that are going to slow you down and act as barriers and we must address them so whichever one you have you video so we can fix it so what will stop you from losing weight that goes beyond the eating plan is the sleep if you not sleeping you weight it you burn all the fat when you sleeping and then when you watch that video we underlying causes of a lack of sleep it could be the adrenal gland it could be S apnea which you nutrients that the swelling is going on your nose and you can um there all sorts of causes to sleep but that one big barrier also digestion if your digestion is off if you have constipation if you get bloating if you feel very full all the time or you have a swelling stomach we have to fix that because it to lose weight it interfere your ability to sleep so digestion is very important to use that as an indicator to know that it working um energy level you think you really going to lose weight if you tired and you energy problems come from sleep issues but it can also come from a thyroid ISS it can come from anemia you don enough iron in your blood it can come from a lot of different sources so in the video and energy if you have fatigue watch that one you will actually address that uh menstrual cycle if your menstrual cycle is off you have a hard time losing weight why because that means your estrogen off and estrogen makes fat so we want that estrogen to be at the right level so it doesn it doesn making fat generally speaking so we want that menstrual cycle to be very smooth we want the menopausal symptoms like the high flashes to be completely gone again if you flashes all night long it inere your sleep you lose weight these are just barriers uh Cravings one way I know that you burning fat is you crave nothing and you you sugar that fix the cravings and we it within the pro um inflammation that that means that your adrenals aren strong enough and you have um it almost equivalent to having way too many applications on your desktop computer and it energy from the body and it um your metabolism not work as as good because it draws power from the adrenal glands okay so we want the adrenal glands to be chilled out and that brings us to the next thing of stress if the body is stuck in stress mode and it can and it doesn thinking and all these other things that means the adrenal glands are overloaded and you have too much body stress we must eliminate that to remove these barriers to be able to lose the weight again a lot of people focus on diet and exercise they don look at the whole picture the whole body and to get the person truly healthy I would tell you that if you didn any of these issues you healthy these are good indicators of levels of Health okay so to be able to get where you need to go we handle these in the way it make it easy for you to lose weight especially long term	Success
Is Ketosis Dangerous? Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_434ERRbkj8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hello we subject called ketosis what is it ketosis is the state of fat burning so when you something called ketones what are ketones ketones are those things that it body that sugar or glucose so ketones would be like riding a car using electricity versus diesel fuel with this which is more sugar so it it will give a person way more energy than glucose so even professional athletes can far-out run and perform on ketosis than the carbo-loading ok now how what the premise of ketosis the premise of ketosis is lowering your insulin or your sugars which is refined carbohydrates way way way down there too close to zero like 5 percent of your daily calories and let me explain what insulin is though insulin is the hormone that regulates sugar normally in your blood you only store in your entire body two little teaspoons of sugar that you store that blood so your our bodies were not designed to consume the amount of sweet or sugar that week that we consume may average versus 145 pounds of sugar a year so that more than two teaspoons is going to be very toxic to the body so on an average person they carbohydrate well the body will just jack up insulin it response and then get it out of the blood fast and stick it into the liver and start building up fat or on the liver that people with a fatty liver with high cholesterol high blood fats that is the sugar in their diet it the fat in the diet our bodies make a lot of cholesterol 2,000 milligrams a day so it in fact here the good benefits of being in ketosis which by the way is lowering your carbs increasing your dietary fats and having a moderate amount of protein is it will lower your your bad cholesterol it increases your good cholesterol it lowers your triglycerides and improves blood sugars improve improves in insulin resistance now there are studies that will tell you that it worsens if you eat fat it resistance and that has to do with the type of study that they did it on rats and they use corn oil they didn healthy fats corn oil is not only genetic and modified but it healthy fat so I that made things worse so you really want to when you see these studies that say that you know something actually read what they their fats or their foods and you find that you know even though they just study on vitamins and they use synthetic vitamins versus natural so I always kind of our suspect unless I read this study myself improve memory improve dementia good blood sugar levels reducing acne reducing cancer risk why because sugar feeds cancer in fact there certain types of scans that they do to detect cancer and they look for areas of your body that your Exuma consuming excess sugar because cancer is very hungry for sugar so why not just cut the sugar out and decrease the risk decrease polycystic ovarian syndrome so what is that that has a lot of these little molecules that are growing on the ovaries and it pumping out too much of the wrong hormone the male hormone and they getting acne lots of hair a lot of issues but that will do reduce if you on this eating plan it decreases inflammation I mean how many people have inflammation so sugar will promote inflammation also digested bloating this is very good for a digestion now the healthy fats that you need to be are basically grass-fed animal products like beef or something like that do not consume the lean beefs or the turkey bacon or the chicken without the skin why because we need those healthy fats do not eat eggs without the yolks we need that fat to be able to get you in ketosis no but I know the concern the concern is oh my gosh I don been literally brainwashed to think that it gonna tell you is try it for a couple weeks go get your blood tests and you will see that it will go down and you mean your back cholesterol go down your heart will be cleaning and you have to prove it to yourself and I gonna I underneath this video but I want you personally to experience the benefits of this because long-term for health there you combine sugar with protein you create even worse problems with insulin and that well I everything in moderation but they have just enough sugar in there to cause bump them out of ketosis so all that saturated fat will plug up their arteries because they have just enough to nullify the benefits ok so we have a lot of benefits we don combine carbohydrates or too much protein but I created a link below that lists the eating plan that I would recommend types of foods that you should be on to be able to get yourself into ketosis you the upcoming news by athletes by researchers because it is true and it creates a lot of benefits there couple little twist to it for example if you for so long it takes a little bit to trance adapt your body to this new fuel source and in that transition you might have to take it gradual because you not used to it so some people because the sugar really holds so much fluid you might drop a lot of water weight initially and you also might lose a little too much sodium so you might need to consume more salt on this diet to be able to keep the blood the blood pressure up because it lowers blood pressure and then you when you start dumping all this fat and all this water off your body and you might feel a little light-headed you just might need a little bit more salt so I suggest you push through it it only a transition phase but running your body and ketones it long term so apply what I just told you and make some comments underneath this video	Success
#1 Top Food to Burn your Belly Fat Â Dr. Berg on Fat Burning Foods	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0J1UXUqVrU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey dr. Berg here in this short video we top food to burn belly fat can you have do you have a wild idea do you have any idea what it could be I right now it but I most these diets out there even the prepackaged foods the high protein diets like Atkins diet or protein power all involve protein except for the vegetarian diets which actually add some protein but doesn protein will help you burn fat is because it triggers two of the fat burning hormones one is called growth hormone and the other one is called glucagon and those hormones help dissolve fat but I want to take it one step further because you need this there about this because here things that you must know if you going to do this number one it must not be a large amount of protein per meal you if a little bit is good a lot is not good if you guys start eating more protein past six ounces per meal like you start doing eight ounces 10 ounces 12 ounces what gonna put a lot of stress on your liver because your body has to break down the success amount of protein our bodies don fact there they lose their hair or their nails I just need to get more protein not necessarily it has to do with the liver function and the hormone interaction so I would consume about maybe 3 to 6 ounces of protein per meal ok that step one number two that protein must be quality most of the diet programs out there use the soy protein isolate protein powder or the cheap whey protein powder that is a low quality protein and if you body protein you healthy as you lose weight I people that will do this and they look older they don ragged and looked like a crackhead so we don protein like grass-fed beef grass-fed you know chickens organic chicken free-range eggs that protein or or wild caught fish those are all really good quality proteins and then the third thing and this is what a like the Atkins diet does not do is they don waste of the acid from the protein protein turns into a waste product if you have too much of it like it turns into either ammonia it could occur pneumonia or uric acid and so if you consume enough vegetable like 7 cups it will flush all this waste out of your body out of your liver and kind of buffer the kind of the side effect of the protein effect okay because the kidneys and liver can kind of get congested with all this protein so as long as your vegetables are high then you can tolerate this protein that would be the number one top food if you wanted to burn belly fat or any fat for that matter because it fat burning hormones	Success
17 Ways To Eat More Vegetables in Your Diet Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSuvDNeerjs	Dr. Eric Berg DC	you know I always get this question how do I get all these vegetables in my body in this video I whole bunch of ideas on how to be creative in getting all the vegetables in your body and making them less boring so number one is the kale shake as you may already know on my website I really big on kale why because it has the most nutrition of any vegetable on the planet has per cup it thousand international units of vitamin A a lot of potassium and so if you just take kale and fruit blend it you can drink your vegetables okay so that would be number one then number two we can actually cut down the salad now what I have is I salad cutter and what you can do is you can actually take the amount of greens that you have now just so you know I consumed a lot of greens you do not have to do all these greens in one sitting but this is just what I do so I at the store and you basically just cut it down into very small little pieces so you it makes it easier to break down and digest and eat and then what I do is I had a whole bunch of stuff on it and then I actually had some salad dressing I like the Newman because it MSG there easy I boom good to go so cut down your salad make it easier to consume alright number three veggies with cheese so you can have broccoli with melted cheese cauliflower with melted cheese there great restaurant in my area called the melting pot and they it they make this melted cheese and you dip your vegetables and that and tasty way to get more greens or vegetables in your diet now number four steamed veggies there that you would take spinach and you put it on the on a pan in a stove and you steam it and it cooks down into a smaller amount I like to add organic canned kidney beans warm those up sometimes I put some tuna on it and then you can put sea salt pepper and garlic and it another thing that you can do that may actually make it easy to consume your greens number five we have cut Tomatoes with basil if you have some really good tasting tomatoes from the farmers market or from the health food store that actually tastes like tomatoes and you cut those up and you add basil to it fresh basil with ranch dressing that makes a great kind of a salad but it different it don the greens but it your vegetables but you having tomatoes so that favorite of mine all right number six cut veggies with dip or hummus so you have the traditional cucumber carrot celery but you can have zucchini and even mushrooms if you want and you just dip them you could dip them into certain dips that don dressing Newman really no-brainer way to get more vegetables without having to you know like just eat them plain so make them taste good now number seven zucchini with pasta you could take zucchini I have the recipe on that log shape it down as noodles and you don to cook it actually you can have it raw and put some pasta sauce on it or pesto it cheese I actually really enjoy this one as well number eight spaghetti squash with pasta if you can get it at any grocery store you cut it in half and you put in the oven for about 40 minutes you bake it and it comes out as noodles and it because you could add some pasta sauce make that could be your noodles and instead of using the wheat pasta noodles really delicious it favorites number nine we have grilled zucchini you basically just grill it and before you grill it you just put some olive oil on it sea salt and pepper and maybe some other spices and it another one of my favorite is another way to just make vegetables taste good all right number ten veggies and omelets every time you make in the morning to stuff it with vegetables you can put mushrooms and onions and tomatoes and whatever you like that kale there can get pretty much anywhere on the internet you just take your kale you drizzle some olive oil and some sea salt and you bake it and they and it comes out this is your alternative to your potato chip another great way to make your vegetables taste delicious number 12 Green powders this would be the barley greens or the wheatgrass juice powders I have one called the wheatgrass juice powder that good because it powder it I mean one teaspoon is equivalent to about four and a half pounds of nutrients and vegetables so since the purpose of vegetables is to give nutrients this way you can have a very small amount a little teaspoon in a glass mix it up and drink it up and you get a lot of nutrition without having to eat four pounds of vegetables so that a really good idea Green powders of course I want to mention my kale shake my instant kale shake this is another delicious way what I different ways to make taste good kale taste good by taking powdered kale mixing with chocolate or fruit or or caramel flavoring and and putting a protein called pea protein and it sweetened with the wreath with all and xylitol and it and you just mix water or almond of almond milk and blend it up or shake it up and it in a shake so you you won the kale in there but it has a good amount of kale per serving okay number fourteen your favorite veggies now what does that mean it means that out of all of that cheese what is your favorite it just one vegetable if you don vegetables like I had one guy he the only vegetable that he liked was peace and basically that lot of peas every single day and he bought the frozen pea then slightly steamed him and he consumed as he put those in omelets and different things so you can also do that as well number 15 I created a recipe that involved using cauliflower and mozzarella cheese for the crust on a pizza you can also do that that another way to get your kids to consume cauliflower and you won it very filling so you don you could make a vegetarian pizza number 16 you could have vegetable soup I suggest make your own put a lot of vegetables in it you can put kale and beans and all sorts of things a bean soup and that another no-brainer to get some more vegetables because normally when you have warmed soup it very easy to consume that during the winter because it goes down nicely versus all the cold vegetables that you would eat now number 17 in the last one vegetable juice now I the v8 because really those that pasteurized and when you heat all these vegetables too much you kill it so as you notice none of these involve overcooking the vegetables like you would get at the restaurant at the all-you-can-eat buffets so this one is involving the juicing of the vegetables so I normally recommend I don recommend juicing but if you have this with maybe just a little bit of carrot to add a little bit of sweetness not too much because it could spike your sugar it do occasionally but you want to take these green vegetables and you can juice them and at least get the nutrition from that but ideally it your vegetables so that of how to get more vegetables in your body and make them taste a little bit more interesting	Success
The Perfect Diet Â Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6bTwOo3H1A	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so the question is what is the perfect diet okay what what would you think would be the most perfect diet in the world because there and if you start doing Google searches you confused so what I want to do to answer that question is to give you a principle that you should eat for nutrients because the healthiest most perfect diet in the world would satisfy all of the nutrient requirements I about eating some food and taking some synthetic vitamins with it or having a food that has enriched with synthetic vitamins that about a diet that would satisfy all the nutrients that you need a diet that would be that would create the most health and have the properties in those foods that would enhance and prevent the most health problems like there are foods out there that prevent cancer there are foods out there that will prevent macular degeneration your vision that will help protect you down the road in bulletproof your health preventively and then the most perfect diet would be those foods that would contain the most that are most natural okay so of course you have the difference between wild-caught and farm raised fish which should be like like hormone pellets and things like that or free-range vs. farm like in this in this barn where they have three thousand chickens and one tiny little cage or you have organic versus regular hormone fed animals like that type of thing or pesticides sprayed on the foods so the most perfect diet obviously wouldn would include GMO foods genetically modified foods so you want to look at the food the foods that would satisfy the majority of the deficiencies now it makes no sense to take vitamins unless your food you what I tell you this you want to look at food from a different angle not necessarily what you feel like eating this all the time but what during a given day how am I gonna get the nutrition okay but how do you know that that it I created some software I took me over two years and I personally invested of my own money about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to build this software so I hope you appreciate it because it a free software for anyone and all it does is it analyzes what you eat in a given day and it compares it with all the nutrients that you should be having for your age for your sex male or female and it will then tell you what you deficient in okay and then not only that it and in the amounts that you need to eat them why is that viable because very few people are getting enough nutrition from the diet that they and so what we want to do is know are we deficient well before we become deficient so this is more of like preventative stuff why would you wait until you develop a problem and then try to fix it with a vitamin when you can actively eat the nutrition right over here so you never end up like that so it very very simple and very logical but to do that you really need to evaluate what you do eat because let mineral potassium potassium is needed in the amounts of 4700 milligrams per day now you might say why eat a banana really well that you need for you bananas a day so what you can do is you can find out what foods have the highest potassium not just bananas and then eat more of those if you then it will evaluate some of the trace minerals that you need to like iodine and selenium all these trace minerals that are not in our soils in the US they Hawaii because the volcanic ash laid out the trace minerals and and Italy probably or Europe or Russia or even Africa but not in America because we don the soil so you want to start focusing on foods that have the most nutrition but what I did is it creates we that out okay so what I want you to do is to go down here click the link below fill out one day of food and it will do the rest it will evaluate all your information compare it to what what you should be getting nutrition wise it graph it for you and then it what foods to put more attention on over time and I would recommend to take this quiz maybe once a month to get an idea if you away you are from the ideal perfect diet so take the quiz and apply the information	Success

Why Some Skinny People donÂt Gain Weight? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhvNRtlJfKc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	Hey guys, listen. I wanted to cover this topic. Um, I get people that say, I want. that. Um, assuming that if you don have any fat, extra fat on your body, you because if you ever check a blood and someone who eats junk food and yet they they have a lot of cholesterol issues. They got high A1C, which is an indicator of diabetes. And uh so let what really happens. What happens is they have a very very high metabolic rate. Okay? So when the sugar goes in the blood, insulin is kicked in there. So the insulin is then stored as sugar and the excess is stored as fat and cholesterol. So what happens is that because their metabolism is so fast, they they converting it, but they break down the cholesterol because your body can that who bad cholesterol is just their profiles of triglycerides are like off the chart. So, it catches up with them when they get diabetes. But that So, the metabolism really kind of makes them appear to be healthy when they really not. And there to put down below which is fascinating because it talked about um longevity and uh so this is what it said. This is the summary of it. An overweight person and an obese person class one actually live a little bit longer than a thinner person. Okay, I know that believe, but probably the good thing about gaining weight is that it wakes you up and it gets you to change your diet. Even for myself, I was very very thin all the way up going through my 20s and I never it never motivated me to make a change until my my late 20s. And so people a lot of times they don change their ways until they either have a problem, but the biggest motivator is when your gut starts getting big and you can motivator. So, that But it people and obese type one live a little bit longer, like 6% more than thin people. Interesting. Put your comments down below. Hi guys. Listen, I created an evaluation quiz.

How To Stick To Diet & Stay Consistent With Healthy Eating? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl2vnk4i0t4	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey I talk about why people really don to and stay consistent with healthy eating now this probably is not targeted to you but you probably know people and friends and family that just cannot stick to a diet no matter what the diet that I in a minute fasting program is very easy to stick to it as long as you get into it and get through that first two weeks and then it cravings go away and you anymore but for most people they still have a hard time staying consistent so let why don experience like like a diabetic for example if you 40 X x it getting glaucoma then if you didn diabetes now just that data alone would give you prediction um chances are you people again like to keep consuming junk food they don strange and I think really the big reason why people can because they live in the moment in the present and not enough in the future they they they want that quick sensation that quick pleasure instant gratification but without really kind of confronting what one of the things that I did in my book is in the back I put something called conscious eating cards you can cut it out but in your purse but in your wallet and the purpose for this is to really make you very aware of the consequences of doing certain things so like if you or some juice or some alcohol it recommended that you read these to just remind yourself and start living in the future and decide what I consume this and is it worth it and that now if you take a look at the top ways people actually die cancer stroke heart attack kidney disease Alzheimer diabetes complications with the common thread the common thread with all of these is high levels of insulin so I think the awareness of understanding the mechanism the cause-and-effect relationship and also start living more in the future you could just make better decisions so the next time you get tempted from eating that doughnut before you make the decision really weigh it out is the temporary pleasure really worth the future consequences thanks for watching hey thank you so much for watching keep spreading the word and share this video	Success

The Importance of Phosphorus for Energy Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqxt0-EE0Ys	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys I wanted to do a video on phosphorus to my knowledge I don I very important mineral because it is an intimately involved in the formation of energy have you heard of ATP adenosine triphosphate okay I mean that energy source that in the body and we need phosphorus to build that up also all the cell membranes have a phospholipid membrane okay so we need phosphorus for that your bones need phosphorus so phosphorus works with calcium in the body and if you don tired you get weak bones you get joint pain stiffness you get a calcium deposits in the joints so when you increase phosphorus it can help balance out the excess calcium in the body the best foods for phosphorus are scallops that sardines pumpkin seeds fish shrimp cod mushrooms eggs and meat now there is a considerable amount of phosphorus in grains legumes and nuts but the problem is that you have phytic acid that locks up the minerals that are not released now there grains called fight ace which is supposed to neutralize this but the problem is when you grind the grain or you mill millet or you cook it or with time you lose that enzyme so the absorption of phosphorus is much much lower so stick with these foods right here and I think you have enough phosphorus alright thanks for watching hey guys I want to personally invite you to a new Facebook group that I just started called dr. Berg minute fasting lab ok so I created this so we can share our successful actions what worked what didn so I put a link down below so go ahead and sign up and I	Success

How Can Eating Fat LOWER Your Cholesterol? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugJR4LxZzYY	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I had another question how can eating fat lower my cholesterol okay it confusing because afterall high fat diets will increase your cholesterol right not quite here fat diet normally you will increase the carbs people that are on low fat diets are really on a high carb diet okay and anytime you combine the carbs like sugar with the fat you spike insulin so not a good situation in fact a lot of the studies in that fact most of the studies out there that show the harmful effects of high fat diets are done with high fat diets fed to mice with lots of carbs and that you need to do a low fat diet but the thing you need to know is that your body does make cholesterol it makes a lot of it it makes 3,000 milligrams that lot in fact that would be equivalent to consuming 14 eggs or a pound of butter every single day so your body makes the same amount of cholesterol so when you lower the dietary cholesterol your body will then make more okay so if you eat more it makes less because we need cholesterol you know if it body make it you need it for all the cellular membranes you need it for the brain you need for your hormones especially testosterone you need it for the stress hormones called cortisol you need it for the eyes you need it for the nervous system you needed to actually repair certain things in the body so it endocrine system and the type of fat that we keto is definitely not trans fats hydrogenated oils or soy oil or lard or deep fried anything okay we about healthy fats like coconut oil avocado nuts grass-fed meats grass-fed dairy like cheese Wow caught fish grass-fed butter cod liver oil so there is no studies that show that consuming these fats are in any way shape or form harmful to your cholesterol or your heart okay what what spike in cholesterol is the high amounts of carbs the type of eating plan that I low carb higher fat and that way we won the cholesterol but some people might have a temporary spike in cholesterol because of the fact that the fat is being released they the fat cells and some of that fat in there is cholesterol and triglycerides so it has to come out but that temporary thing it then it comes back down to normal but the majority of the population will notice a decrease in cholesterol once they go in a low carb diet do it for one month then check your cholesterol and prove it to yourself as well as your doctor hey you know what I just want to say something only 30% of the people that watching this video actually make it this far and you did so I really appreciate you thank you so much	Success
8 Emotional Eating Tips Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkI8lg_kWHc	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys today we eight emotional eating tips so number one avoid certain environments where you know food is going to be displayed like at the bakery don bakery certain social events where you know there food and candies and cookies avoid those environments okay very important same thing with restaurants the first thing they come to bring people is the the bread okay so just make sure you tell the waiter don the desserts okay because they they really push these sweets on everyone vitamin b1 is crucial for handling stress and feelings of you down it brings people up nutritional yeast you can get it in tablets it we we maybe anxiety or depression right b1 is vital and the problem is consuming the sugar will deplete your b1 and create those sensations it never-ending trap where you the junk you depleted to b1 you want it more you consume it you deplete b1 and it keeps going okay number three sleep more very very important to focus on the sleep because people that don tend to crave it more they tend to eat more foods when they hungry so their appetite is higher and they four if it menstrual cycle then take some seek help or there balance I put a link down below that will help stabilize your cycle but iodine and other factors will help balance estrogen because this is a real big problem it kind of puts you in a state that irritable moody and of course you going to eat to help get relief number five fix the blood sugar issues you probably been watching my videos but even if you haven watching the ones on keto and in a minute fasting because unless that blood sugar is handled boy it really impossible to get rid of the hunger and the cravings but if we could make it so you don anything and you gonna make it a lot easier six have substitute desserts available in your refrigerator or freezer there recipes that you can make that mimic the foods that you shouldn and cookies and pies and all you have to do is consume one of those with your meal okay not between the meals and that way you won number seven no junk food in the house you your spouse and get their agreement that you just can house and also not in little baskets around the kitchen and in the living room where our food is just sitting there all over the place so we want to get the food into the cupboards or the refrigerator and not in front of your face especially if you get bored at night it of like oh let me start eating these nuts number eight and this is really important plan out all the meals for the week and the membership site you get something called a meal maker and a couple clicks of your mouse you can actually select the foods that you want it generates a whole week of food so you have a plan of action and you don up going off the program simply because you organizational step before you just focus on doing the program is usually missed by a lot of people so you the key is planning this thing out for the whole week so you have the food there it planned and you just follow the plan all right thanks for watching so if you enjoying these videos click Share and spread the word	Success
The Most Common Dieting Misconception Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyS29xA7qy8	Dr. Eric Berg DC	okay so I had to do this video because I was searching on the internet for diet and the first three to four pages are just covered with false information so if you for you I really simple and I hope you get to this video before the other ones because it gonna save you a lot of grief so there a misconception that most people have about dieting when they get into dining that the weight loss is equal to the fat loss in other words if they lose weight they absolutely not true when you change your diet most people will lose some water weight in the first two weeks and then they will plateau and if they think that fat they whole bunch of confusion following that because then you advice and exercise more because it all about calories and you less okay now during this time you craving you more carbs and that gain the weight back or you actually might have stopped the weight loss but these two actions right here are not going to help you because look at this too much insulin will just lock up the release of this fat you cannot release fat if there keeps this lock on this fat and prevents you from using it is the stored sugar that you have and also the carbs in the bloodstream so the two things the most important crucial things to put all your attention on is just to deplete the stored sugar and reduce your carbs how do you do that you eat less frequent you do intermittent fasting that is going to deplete the stored sugar and you can also add exercise to speed it up as well and also you must eat less carbs so therefore they then this lock will open up and you can start releasing fat that important thing these other things will not help you eating less fat higher protein or less protein a plant-based eating healthier it really has to do with these two things right here alright so a new person I suggest that you watch the link down below to get the full story of how to do this with all the details thanks for watching hey if you enjoyed this video press subscribe and I will definitely keep you updated	Success

Does Chocolate Have Caffeine? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIkqvSl97Ng	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys I wanted to do a quick video to answer question does chocolate have caffeine okay and the answer is yes it does have a small amount it like one ounce of chocolate will have anywhere between 4 to 20 milligrams of caffeine which is pretty small compared to coffee or even tea but it has something else called theobromine okay now what is that well this is also a stimulant this is a stimulant but theobromine is a vasodilator okay caffeine is a vasoconstrictor what does that mean it means that when something is vaso dilated it opens up it relaxes the blood vessel it actually will reduce blood pressure caffeine is constrictor it can increase blood pressure theobromine also is a mood elevator it kind of brings you up okay and that why people consume chocolate when they problems with consuming chocolate is it sugar okay so if you could find chocolate with stevia or maybe inulin or a wreath root all that would be better but the other problem is these two stimulants which can keep you up at night so if you chocolate make sure it consume it earlier in the day thanks for watching so if you videos click share and spread the word	Success
Farm Raised Fish OR Wild Caught Fish, Which Is Best To Consume? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2uAyp6WCnA	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys I question from someone that wanted to know do I have to do wild-caught fish because it just do farm raised fish and the answer is yes because if you knew what farm raised fish consumed you would definitely not consume them because they have cornmeal which is GMO soy bean okay meal which is a GMO again canola that GMO genetically modified which means it has residue of glyphosate which is a herbicide wheat okay animal by-products meat which is probably fed corn soy and canola blood of the animal feathers poultry fat which is again fed GMO grains fish meat sometimes antibiotics depending on what part of the country that the they farmed the fish and on top of everything there PCBs I put a link down below for more information it other problem with farm raised fish is that they contain three times the amount of omega-6 fatty acids as compared to wild-caught and omega-6 is very inflammatory so you could get some more inflammation in your body and only half the Omega threes so you have this very out of balance unhealthy ratio of six versus three which is going to set people up for more inflammation so spend the money invest in your health as your new health insurance get the wild-caught don the farm-raised so if you don want to check it out it not lose weight to get healthy it healthy to lose the weight healthy ketosis and in a minute fasting check it out I put a link down below	Success
Coconut Oil vs. Olive Oil: Which is Better?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVvw-ReyBE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so I recently had a question from someone that wanted to know what would be better to use coconut oil or olive oil so I want to go through the some of the differences but they really good oils but have slightly different purposes so let oil it acids which typically will cause inflammation but olive oil is one of the only oils being omega-6 that will not cause inflammation it anti-inflammatory so it mono saturated coconut oil is 92% saturated fat and honestly saturated fat is not a bad thing okay it bad cholesterol it will not clot your arteries it really has no side effects despite being a saturated fat it the type of fat that will cause heart attacks or insulin resistance or anything like that okay now olive oil is great to put on your salad it has tons and tons of phytonutrients I mean a list is very very long so its phytonutrients are those extra nutrients that give you extra health benefits that go beyond vitamins and minerals there any minerals or protein in olive oil Alexei vitamins except there and there healthy fatty acids which are essential that means your body can it needs them so it has Olek acid 83% linolenic acid 21% palmitic acid 20% and there well so it you these fatty acids that are essential but the biggest benefit for elavil is the heart benefit supporting a healthy heart I believe the reason for that is because it stabilizes blood sugars it helps to reduce insulin which is underneath our problem but it has some a direct effects on the heart itself as far as healing the inside of the artery as well and not to mention some vitamin E but there are other benefits as well one being an anti like I mentioned before now coming over the coconut oil coconut oil is really good for your immune system it has something called lauric acid lauric acid is high in breast milk and coconut oil okay so you have to make sure that the quality is there but lauric acid is really good to support an immune system anti microbial you can put a drop of garlic oil and put it in your ear to help ear infections but you can do also do the same thing with olive oil you can put a drop of garlic oil in the olive oil and just put a drop in your ear and that will actually help your infections as well because it supports and protects the flora the friendly bacteria and just attacks the the pathogenic microbes so it coconut oil also has phytonutrients I believe olive oil has more but it still has numerous phytonutrients you can put in your coffee okay and you can blend it up into it like a nice keto coffee it also will increase HDL and lower LDL it diet to give you energy you can put in all sorts of recipes for keto bombs and again both of these have their benefits I wouldn the other I would consume them both but they do slightly different things alright thanks for watching hey you know what I just wanted to say thank you for watching these videos you made it this far I appreciate your attention and your precious time	Success
Omega 3 Fatty Acids in Canned Sardines (Part - 2) Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STZg0R7p_NM	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys I wanted to do an update on a recent video that I did entitled omega-3 fatty acids in can sardines this is part two now in the first video I talked about how heat destroys omega-3 fatty acids because DHA and EPA which are omega-3 fatty acids are very sensitive to oxygen and heat and when you can things you heat them and a lot of times manufacturing companies will reheat it with high temperatures up to five hours after they initially pasteurize it okay really making sure everything is completely dead just to preserve it especially when you do meats okay so when I initially research this I found that anytime you can anything you destroy these omega-3 fatty acids however I had a little attention the fact that I personally have not tested this out I base this off of secondhand information so I recently hired a third party lab and I send out two random samples one a can of sardines and the others a can of tuna to evaluate how much omega-3 fatty acids were in these canned products and I was positive that it was going to come out zero what was I wrong okay this actually shocked me so the sardines had a DHA of 788 milligrams and EPA of 742 milligrams that omega-3 fatty acids and in the sample of canned tuna we had 57 milligrams of DHA and 41 milligrams of EPA and another interesting point are the sardines the sardines were 13 times higher in DHA than the tuna and the EPA was 18 times higher than the EPA of tuna and these are omega-3 fatty acids which is interesting so the only way this makes sense to me is they probably don the high level of heat of other products like canned meats so anyway I will be deleting the other video and I wanted you to have the correct updated information that it is true that canned sardines and do have omega-3 fatty acids thanks for watching so I future videos on topics that you are interested in this one is going to be on your biggest keto difficulty if you wouldn down below I put a link in the description please fill it out thank you so much	Success
Less Bowel Movements with Intermittent Fasting? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5FUhtPowps	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys I wanted to create a quick video on a question then someone had about having less bowel movements when they did in a minute fasting was that normal okay so here to that when you less frequently you don often okay that when you gonna have to go more because you just the volume of food now there difference between constipation and just having less bowel movements okay constipation is when you really feel like you need to go but you can having a less balanced which you don even feel you need to go you just don go as frequent so if you feel constipated or backed up it related to either consuming too many vegetables or not enough vegetables okay the microbes live on the fiber so if you increase it so they can have more food and help you with your digestion if it too many vegetables okay which is another possibility you that you used to digesting especially certain types like the cruciferous like cabbage and broccoli and things that you probably not used to that can do it as well because you don to break them down because the microbes have the enzymes break it down and so it just kind of sits there in which case you would want to change the type of vegetable that you something that you can digest I also recommend steaming your vegetables and having some that are fermented okay very important the last thing I want to mention is if you don have a gallbladder or you have a congestive gallbladder that means that you don lubricates the colon so you may need to get some support with that and usually the symptoms of lack of bile would be your stool floats you get a full sensation over the right lower ribcage area that can refer to the right shoulder burping belching bloating gas okay so there bladder formula I put a link down below to check it out but that will help you lubricate the colon it has additional things in there to help with the pancreas stomach so it is the situation all right all right thanks for watching so I want to know what you future video click the link down below and share some ideas I want to hear	Success

How To Adjust Keto Diet & Intermittent Fasting Patterns Around Your Lifestyle? Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAE1gewiTdQ	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys in this video we talk about how to align the Kido an intermittent fasting pattern around your lifestyle now I from certain people who do this and they have a hard time transitioning Akito adapting because at work they and when they need the most mental energy they they had a problem with that so here one thing you could do very easily to solve that problem and have a little more energy especially in the beginning of doing this in the early part of the day okay here keeping the breakfast keeping the lunch and omit the dinner okay so what you could do to make the transition to start out is go ahead and start with a breakfast okay and then just don that could maybe be like I don three o you were to eat at 8 o morning and then at 12 o would give you 20 hours of fasting so if we compare doing it this way versus consuming maybe a lunch and a dinner with a four-hour window let look at just a difference there number one your stomach is mostly acid in the morning which means it the protein so let of your protein and your fats in the morning versus in the evening okay that may be better for your digestion the other benefit is that this would prevent you going to sleep with your stomach feeling a bit bloated because some people when they have dinner they feel really full and so by the time they kind of stuffed and your digestion if it from sleeping so doing it this pattern will allow your stomach and your digestion to be low stress so you go into a nice sleep cycle without your body having to work too hard on the digestion so this is just another option to see if this may align with your work schedule a little bit better especially if you need maybe more mental energy in the first part of the day right here if you have digestive stress you might want to try this pattern right here alright thanks for watching hey I appreciate your attention and if you enjoying these videos go ahead and subscribe and I will definitely keep you updated on future events live events and webinars that we soon	Success
The Worst and Best Carbs on Keto Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COcvqvNb1MU	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys I wanted to do a video on the worst and best carb on keto okay the worst carb is fructose okay it but it you need to know about fructose table sugar has about 50% glucose and 50% fructose high fructose corn syrup has about 55% fructose in 45% glucose agave nectar has like 90% fructose so this is the worst and then fruit does have fructose but it has a lot of fiber phytonutrients vitamins and minerals so even though it has fructose it doesn nearly create the damage but it will stop you from getting into ketosis simply because they fruit very very sweet and high in sugar the only thing I would recommend related to that would be certain barriers like raspberry and blackberries they low if you had like a couple of those a day I think that would be fine instead of the fruits like the apples and the pears and the grapes which are very very sweet so that let will increase insulin because all of the cells can absorb glucose but not all the cells can deal with fructose mainly the liver okay so all the fructose goes to your liver and the liver is forced to deal with this fructose now the amount of people that are drinking their fructose in sodas and juice incredible amounts so it creates some serious damage because it will turn into fat in the liver it will give you a fatty liver which will then cause insulin resistance and make your insulin spike so fructose indirectly will raise the insulin and create even more damage to the body because the liver gets overloaded and then you a fight of liver and then the capacity to handle it goes down there problems so consuming fructose is very similar to consuming alcohol as far as the damage on the liver okay so fructose is the worst all right the best car are all the leafy greens the vegetables why because they have high fiber very low calories very low on the glycemic index they will not throw you out of ketosis so I don mackerel equation when you keto plan so you want to consume as many vegetables as you can as far as leafy greens on this plan okay well thanks for watching hey guys so I of a future video and I wanted to find out what your biggest body problem is so that way the content is aligning with something that you are personally interested in so please click the link down below fill it out and I will create the video thanks	Success

Artificial Sweeteners: Monk Fruit, Stevia, Erythritol & Xylitol Â Dr. Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jROu0Mo3A9M	Dr. Eric Berg DC	hey guys I had a recent question related to monk fruit and stevia and riether tall and xylitol which one which ones there were so let about these four sweeteners monk fruit and stevia and recruit all all have a zero glycemic index so they will not increase insulin okay xylitol on the glycemic index is thirty so it spike if you consume this one in small amounts it should not be a problem now I do use xylitol for a lot of different recipes simply because it really tastes just like sugar okay stevia has a little bit of an aftertaste but this is really good in things like like flavoring water and carbonated water to make like a soda and it in certain recipes monk fruit also has a slight little aftertaste it really sweet so you don it but both of these are very similar there they kind of give a little bit of an aftertaste they don hundred percent like sugar but they good in certain recipes but not in others I don much I use stevia a little bit more now riether tall doesn but it definitely does not taste like xylitol it has more of a cold taste a cold sweet taste but I still use this in recipes because it this maybe with this or these two together and to have the the right balance now the other point about the wreath throat roll is sometimes it made from corn which is GMO so you want to make sure this one is non-gmo okay same thing with xylitol this you want this from birch bark and non-gmo and if you make sure it worry about it interfering with your intermittent fasting it bump you out of ketosis it small amount that gum that you don want to consume is the gum with aspartame you want to avoid these artificial sweeteners these are sugar alcohols and this is a fruit and this is from a plant these are totally fine there other sugar alcohols and natural sweeteners that you can do but these are the common ones right here between these two I found this one tends to give people a little more digestive problem it consumed in larger amounts this one can be as well but if you small amounts it doesn problem but when you start making these keto bombs or these recipes but it just tastes so good you want to eat a lot of it well then you problems because they can act as a laxative or give you gas and sometimes you consume anything sweet whether it fruit or stevia even know it calories it i never see a problem with that i wouldn worry about it thanks for watching hey I appreciate your attention and if you enjoying these videos go ahead and subscribe and I will definitely keep you updated on future events live events and webinars that we soon	Success
